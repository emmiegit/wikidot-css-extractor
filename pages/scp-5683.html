&gt; 
&gt; Congratulations again on your success with the Domesday Clock project. It was a magnificent accomplishment, and I can confirm that your name has been brought up favorably in our last meeting.
&gt; 
&gt; In response to your query last we spoke — yes, we are still searching for an appropriate candidate for Director of Site-04 following Director Bray&#39;s retirement. Your name //is// on the list, but the Council still wishes for you to prove yourself capable a little more before we&#39;re prepared to make a final decision.
&gt; 
&gt; We&#39;d like for you to solve the SCP-5683 problem. The assignment&#39;s already been issued.
&gt; 
&gt; Hoping you are well,

**Item #:** SCP-5683

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5683 is to be neutralized as soon as possible. 

In order to reduce the number of containment breaches, it is to be constantly dosed with a stream of sedatives — the chemical makeup of which is to be adjusted constantly in order to prevent SCP-5683 from adapting to it. In the event that these sedatives are unsuccessful in disabling SCP-5683, the containment chamber is to be immediately flooded with hydrochloric acid.

All termination attempts must be approved by project head Doctor Kristiansen.

**Description:** SCP-5683 is a large arachnid organism, capable of rapid regeneration and bodily modification. It is extremely hostile to all human life, and will constantly attempt to breach containment in order to engage in mass slaughter. This is usually performed via injection of venom using its mandibles and impalement using its legs.

Although SCP-5683 has demonstrated the capability for basic reasoning and planning when hunting prey, it is not believed to possess human-level intelligence.

When placed into a threatening situation, SCP-5683 will quickly adapt in order to become more resistant to whatever form of danger is being posed to it. These adaptations will persist until said danger is no longer present.

------

**Addendum 5683-1 (Termination Order):** Due to frequent containment breaches and the increasing drain on Foundation resources brought about by SCP-5683&#39;s continued containment, a termination order on SCP-5683 has been issued. Termination will be overseen by the new project head, Dr. Kristiansen.

The following is an archive of attempts to terminate SCP-5683, along with discussions regarding them:

&gt; **Discussion Log 5683-1**
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject of Discussion:** Introduction of new project head, deliberation over initial termination attempts regarding SCP-5683.
&gt; **Personnel Present:** Doctor Kristiansen, Researcher Miles, Researcher Hall, Junior Researcher Silva, Security Chief Aday.
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** //(sniffs)// Do you smell something burning?
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** I&#39;m told there&#39;s been a mild, ah, accident at the cafeteria earlier today, sir. I apologize.
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** I see, I see. //(laughs)// Hopefully we&#39;ll fare a little better than them, eh?
&gt; 
&gt; //(Laughter.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** Very good, sir!
&gt; 
&gt; **Security Chief Aday:** If we could get down to business.
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Right, yes, of course. So — SCP-5683. I&#39;ve read the documentation, but I&#39;ve always found accounts from those working with the anomaly can be much more helpful. Anything I should know?
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Hall:** Well ... I suppose...
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Well? Out with it, man.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Miles:** It&#39;s smarter than it looks. If it spots a way to escape, it&#39;ll take it in an instant.
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Well, maybe we can use that.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Anyone else?
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** //(sighs)// I won&#39;t lie, I expected more. For now, we&#39;re going to do some basic stress tests on the thing. Start off with tissue samples, then try it out on the genuine article. No point getting complicated if we can just kill it with fire, eh?
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** Very good, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**

&gt; **Termination Log 5683-1**
&gt; 
&gt; **Stimulus:** Incineration at a temperature of 850 °C for a period of thirty seconds.
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **Tissue Sample Results:** Sample successfully incinerated without relapses.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5683 Results:** SCP-5683 thrashes and screeches upon introduction of heat for thirty seconds, before developing armored plating covered with an unknown substance that prevents combustion.

&gt; **Discussion Log 5683-2**
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject of Discussion:** Further attempts to terminate SCP-5683.
&gt; **Personnel Present:** Doctor Kristiansen, Researcher Miles, Researcher Hall, Junior Researcher Silva, Security Chief Aday.
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** //(sniffing)// Jesus, that stinks. Another bad day for the cafeteria?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Miles:** Seems so. Apparently, we&#39;ll just have to bear with it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** Extremely sorry for the inconvenience, sir — and in regards to the last termination test, sir, I&#39;m afraid it, well, was expected.
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** //Thank you//, Junior Researcher. I hope you didn&#39;t think I seriously believed that would work. It was a test to establish a baseline.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** And lose the &#39;sir&#39;.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** Sorry, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **Security Chief Aday:** If we could get down to business.
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Yes, yes, of course. I&#39;ve contacted the O5 Council and requested the use of some anomalous substances to aid with termination — not anomalous enough to qualify for containment, but anomalous enough to help us out here. Probably less toxic than whatever they&#39;ve got in that cafeteria, too.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Laughter.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Hall:** Nice one.
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** Just for logging purposes, sir, may I inquire about the specific substances we&#39;re shipping in?
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Of course. Y220, Y835 and Y436. I&#39;m told they should be arriving within the week — I expect each would be enough to do the job, but it&#39;s best to hedge our bets. This spider doesn&#39;t compare to the lizard, I&#39;ll tell you that.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Junior Researcher Silva smiles.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** You&#39;ve worked with the lizard, sir? When was that, if you don&#39;t mind me asking, sir?
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Um, well, a few years back, I suppose — we had a containment breach back then. It ... //(frowns)// ... it wasn&#39;t pleasant.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Anyway, Y220, Y835 and Y436. Get that logged.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** Excellent choice, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Hall:** Fantastic work.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Miles:** Magnificent.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**

&gt; **Termination Log 5683-2**
&gt; 
&gt; **Stimulus:** Y220
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **Tissue Sample Results:** Sample successfully converted into glass, which then violently explodes.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5683 Results:** 80% of SCP-5683&#39;s body converted into glass within nine seconds, which then violently explodes. Regeneration increases in speed until SCP-5683 is completely healed within thirty seconds.

&gt; **Termination Log 5683-3**
&gt; 
&gt; **Stimulus:** Y835
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **Tissue Sample Results:** Sample splits into two independent organisms, which then kill each other through mutual injection of venom.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5683 Results:** SCP-5683 splits into two entities, SCP-5683-1 and SCP-5683-2, which then inject each other with their venom. SCP-5683-2 perishes near-instantly, but SCP-5683-1 adapts an immunity to the venom and survives. SCP-5683-1 then consumes SCP-5683-2 to regain lost mass.

&gt; **Termination Log 5683-4**
&gt; 
&gt; **Stimulus:** Y436
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **Tissue Sample Results:** Sample is reduced to a fine mist.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5683 Results:** SCP-5683 is reduced to a fine mist. All lights in the facility turn off — when they reactivate three seconds later, SCP-5683 has fully regenerated.

&gt; **Discussion Log 5683-3**
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject of Discussion:** Termination of SCP-5683.
&gt; **Personnel Present:** Doctor Kristiansen, Researcher Miles, Researcher Hall, Junior Researcher Silva, Security Chief Aday.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; //(Doctor Kristiansen kicks his chair angrily. It falls to the floor.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** The file says adaptation, right? //A-dap-tat-ion.// Coming back to life when the lights turn out is //not// adaptation, it&#39;s some magic bullshit!
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** Please calm down, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Silva, I swear to God.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** Sorry, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Doctor Kristiansen sighs, picks his chair up, and sits down.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Security Chief Aday:** If we could get down to business.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** I&#39;m requisitioning Y910.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Hall:** //(slowly)// That&#39;s a little ...
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Miles:** Are you sure about that, sir?
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Yes. I am //absolutely// sure about it. If the GOC can use it to poison gods, I think it can take care of one giant spider.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** But, sir...
&gt; 
&gt; //(Doctor Kristiansen stands up.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** But //nothing//! And, and another thing — we&#39;re losing the tissue test! The O5&#39;s will replace Bray soon, and I&#39;m not going to be sitting around //wasting time//!
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** //(sighs)// I&#39;ll ... I&#39;ll take full responsibility for the decision.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Everyone in the room turns to look at Doctor Kristiansen.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** You will, sir?
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Should anything go wrong, yes. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** Very good, sir! Very good!
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Well, uh. Get preparations underway.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Hall:** Of course.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Doctor Kristiansen walks to the door and leaves the room.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(Laughter.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**

&gt; **Termination Log 5683-4**
&gt; 
&gt; **Stimulus:** Y910
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5683 Results:** Energizing response. Containment breach in progress.

&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; //(Doctor Kristiansen and Junior Researcher Silva run into the secure bunker. Doctor Kristiansen seals the door behind them, then slumps against the wall.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** //(quietly)// This isn&#39;t happening. //This isn&#39;t happening.// 
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause. Doctor Kristiansen looks up and sniffs.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Oh Jesus, what&#39;s that smell?!
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** It must have … it must have gotten to the reactor, sir. I&#39;m so sorry, sir — this is all my fault.
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Your fault? How so? What did you do?
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause. Doctor Kristiansen stands up.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** //What the fuck did you do?!//
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** I … it&#39;s my job sir, my duty, to oppose actions that — actions that I believe are ill-advised. I didn&#39;t do that for you, sir. I&#39;m sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Yes. Yes!
&gt; 
&gt; //(Doctor Kristiansen approaches Junior Researcher Silva and jabs a finger into his chest.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Do you know how many people have //died// because you couldn&#39;t do your job? Because you //refused// to?
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** //(crying)// I&#39;m sorry, sir. I&#39;m sorry, sir. But … you&#39;re the one, sir! You wanted to use Y910! You wouldn&#39;t listen, sir!
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** //(quietly)// Are you trying to make me your scapegoat, Silva?
&gt; 
&gt; //(Junior Researcher Silva shakes his head.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** //(crying)// I&#39;m not … I&#39;m not, sir … but there are procedures, sir, for a — for a reason. The tissue sample … you must admit, even a little —
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** //(quietly)// When we get out of here, I am going to tell the Council the truth about what happened here. The truth about what you&#39;ve done. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** But…
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Shut your fucking mouth, Silva.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** But, sir — with all due respect — I don&#39;t think that will be possible.
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** What do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** This chamber, sir … it isn&#39;t nearly strong enough to survive the reactor overloading, I&#39;m afraid.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Doctor Kristiansen staggers backwards, head in his hands.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Shit. No, no, no no no, //shit//.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause. Junior Researcher Silva sits in the corner.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** I shouldn&#39;t have led us here, sir —
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** No, you //shouldn&#39;t// have.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** — but, and this is with all due respect to your countless accomplishments, sir, you ... you //must// admit some personal responsibility.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Doctor Kristiansen turns to Junior Researcher Silva.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** //(screaming)// //Shut the fuck up!// Stop talking about whose fault this is! What the hell is the matter with you?!
&gt; 
&gt; //(Loud banging is heard against the bunker door. Doctor Kristiansen yelps and retreats to the back wall.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** No, no, no! Please! //Please!//
&gt; 
&gt; //(Junior Researcher Silva stands in front of Doctor Kristiansen. The bunker door is ripped open, revealing SCP-5683 standing behind it. It moves inside, screeching.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** Sir, I&#39;ll — I&#39;ll occupy it! Please, run!
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(Doctor Kristiansen pushes Junior Researcher Silva towards SCP-5683 and prepares to run.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-5683 disappears.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** I — I — wha...? 
&gt; 
&gt; //(Junior Researcher Silva turns towards Doctor Kristiansen.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** Disappointing, sir. Extremely disappointing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** //What?//
&gt; 
&gt; //(Researcher Miles, Researcher Hall and Security Chief Aday enter the bunker through the torn-open door. Doctor Kristiansen again approaches the back wall.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** What&#39;s going on? What happened to 5683?
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** I&#39;m afraid, sir, that there&#39;s little reason in keeping a dummy around once it&#39;s served its purpose.
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** Its ... its purpose? What are you //talking// about, man?!
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** As a substitute, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** I don&#39;t...
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** You mentioned you worked with a lizard, sir. That there was a containment breach. If you don&#39;t terribly mind me asking, how did you escape that situation? It seemed quite lethal, didn&#39;t it?
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** ...where am I?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Hall:** Don&#39;t ask pointless questions.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Miles:** Don&#39;t ask questions you know the answer to.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause. Doctor Kristiansen turns to Junior Researcher Silva.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** //(hoarse)// Who are you people?
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** We are the Jury, sir. Your Jury. And I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ve disgraced yourself quite horribly once again.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** Would you like me to clarify anything for you, sir?
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** //(quietly)// How long have I been here?
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** A considerable amount of time, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** How much ... how much //longer// will I be here?
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** Until you take responsibility, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Doctor Kristiansen moves into the corner, shaking.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** This is ... this is my fault.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Miles:** You say it, but you don&#39;t mean it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Hall:** You don&#39;t mean the things you say.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** //Please. I&#39;m sorry.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Security Chief Aday:** If we could get down to business.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Silva:** Of course.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pause — then Doctor Kristiansen runs for the open door. Before he can reach it, however, a black iron chain appears from around the corner and wraps itself around his throat.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** No, no, no! I&#39;m sorry! //I&#39;m sorry!//
&gt; 
&gt; //(The chain pulls Doctor Kristiansen out the door and around the corner at extremely high speeds — it proceeds to drag him out of the complex, slamming him into every wall as it passes a corner.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Kristiansen:** //It&#39;s not my fault! It&#39;s not my fault!//
&gt; 
&gt; //(The floor and walls drop away, revealing what is behind them. There is a great deal of blood. There is a great deal of fire. There is a great deal of suffering. There is a terrible stench.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(Laughter.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(Laughter.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(Laughter.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(Doctor Kristiansen starts screaming, and never really stops.)//
