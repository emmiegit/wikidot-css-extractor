    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>It was late at night, maybe 6 in the morning; most people in Area-55 were sleeping at this time while Director Roufhous tapped away at their keyboard. They were just finishing writing up this new anomaly, trying to figure out how to say &#34;Luck is an anomaly&#34; professionally, and, more importantly, with a straight face. Whether or not they had failed on this account would be reviewed later.

They had been at this for about 3 hours, most of that time spent reviewing the hundreds of different containment classes and then trying to get ACS to work. They started reading through it, making sure everything was in order. There weren&#39;t too many errors, maybe a misspelling or two that got sniped early, a weird sentence here or there, it was looking pretty good.

In the end, it was another short, simple article describing a god the Foundation was trying to contain. There was still the matter of writing up the Discovery, but getting personnel acquainted with the entity should be foremost, they thought. It would come later, probably in an addendum; everything&#39;s in addendums these days.

By 6:32, they were satisfied with it. It was extremely barebones, but that would be updated later. Now, it was time to submit the document. A seemingly important yet insignificant aspect of the Foundation was designations - There were thousands of anomalies, each categorized by their set number. These numbers were used so often, but didn&#39;t really matter, did they?

They began scrolling through the list of designations looking for a vacant one, occasionally remarking on how many simply stated &#34;ACCESS DENIED&#34;, despite having the second highest clearance in the Foundation. Eventually, they got to the 6900s and still no vacancies. This number, 6000 things the Foundation was keeping in containment, was rather concerning to Pendant.

//That&#39;s weird//, Pendant thought. It ended at 6999, and they didn&#39;t see any available slots. That&#39;s when they looked to the //8// catalogs of documents, //Wait, what?// They took another look at it, and saw it:

[[/=]]

&#34;Well, shit!&#34; They exclaimed. //There&#39;s 7000 now?!// They clicked on the hyperlink, wondering how long it had been like this. The last time the Foundation had reached another thousand individually designated anomalies was back... how many years ago, now?

The page loaded, and they were presented with something they hadn&#39;t seen in a very long time: a catalog completely devoid of used slots, **not even SCP-7000 itself.**

Their eyes, already widened, opened wider as a grin began to stretch itself across their face.

They turned to their document, pressed ctrl and F and the same time, and began replacing all &#34;SCP-XXXX&#34;s with &#34;SCP-7000&#34;.

They hit publish as soon as physically possible. The last little detail? A codename, of course! They returned to the catalog, and it instantly came to them:

&#34;First&#34;

//Backspace, backspace, backspace, backspace, backspace.//

They had another thought and came up with something; a pun, in fact, given the nature of the anomaly and what //she// was.

They typed:

&#34;Ms. Fortune&#34;

Save.
