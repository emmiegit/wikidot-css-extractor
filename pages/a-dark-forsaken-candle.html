&gt; //&#34;Ms. Ross?&#34;//
&gt; 
&gt; //She looked up from the park bench. He was lankier than she thought he would be, but still intimidating. The young thaumatologist nodded.//
&gt; 
&gt; //&#34;You&#39;re Agent Creed then?&#34; she asked.//
&gt; 
&gt; //&#34;The very same,&#34; he replied, and sat on the bench beside her. &#34;This is the last step before we hit the point of no return. Are you sure you wish to continue?&#34;//
&gt; 
&gt; //She nodded.//
&gt; 
&gt; //&#34;Alright then.&#34; The man sighed. &#34;Forgive me for asking, but it is exceedingly rare for us to have an ICSUT grad sign on with us. Would you care to comment?&#34;//
&gt; 
&gt; //She cringed, the image of a golem exploding into a crowded room raced across her mind.//
&gt; 
&gt; //&#34;There was an accident,&#34; she replied. &#34;I&#39;m not welcome in a lot of thaumatology circles on the other side of the Veil anymore. I&#39;m not really sure I want to say more about that at this time. I was told with my contact it wasn&#39;t going to be that relevant.&#34;//
&gt; 
&gt; //The man nodded.//
&gt; 
&gt; //&#34;You&#39;re correct. It isn&#39;t. At least not yet.&#34;//
&gt; 
&gt; //He offered her a handshake.//
&gt; 
&gt; //&#34;Welcome to the Foundation, Agent Ross.&#34;//
