&gt; +++ __SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES__
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; 
&gt; All documents and forms of media identified as carriers for SCP-6620 must be collected by field operatives and subsequently destroyed or contained on a secure Site-921 Anomalous File Server for future analysis. Access to collected materials capable of instantiating SCP-6620&#39;s effects requires Level 3 clearance and documentation of prior cognitohazard inoculation. Exposure to SCP-6620 without cognitohazard inoculation may only occur under strict observation from Level 4 Site-921 research staff. 
&gt; 
&gt; Civilian efforts to investigate the murder of Maria T. O&#39;Connor, regardless of their efficacy, must be thwarted or otherwise halted by whatever means necessary. Personnel suffering from the effects of SCP-6620 are to be apprehended, interrogated, and administered a Class-B amnestic prior to returning to the general population. Large-scale exposure to SCP-6620 may require implementation of various disinformation campaigns up to and including seizure of civilian broadcasting stations and television networks. 
&gt; 
&gt; All stations broadcasting SCP-6620-01 are to be seized by the Foundation and dismantled.

&gt; +++ __DESCRIPTION__
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6620 designates a cognitohazardous effect produced upon exposure to any non-trivial information or media pertaining to the homicide of Maria T. O&#39;Connor, a 32 year old woman who resided in Danvers, Massachusetts. The precise distinction between trivial and non-trivial details relating to the case is unclear, but known triggers for SCP-6620 include possible suspects, the manner in which O&#39;Connor was murdered, identities of O&#39;Connor&#39;s family members, identities of O&#39;Connor&#39;s friends and colleagues, and the address of O&#39;Connor&#39;s residence. SCP-6620 does not appear to be affected in any way by the medium such information is provided in. 
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6620 causes the affected individual to develop an intense interest in the nature of O&#39;Connor&#39;s homicide, often compelling them to investigate the crime on their own or otherwise attempt to access details of the case. As more details are learned by the victim of the cognitohazard, the effects intensify, progressing from an initially minor curiosity to an overwhelming obsession. In late-stage cases, victims of SCP-6620 will engage in hostile or homicidal behavior, believing individuals attempting to stop their investigation are embroiled in a broader conspiracy to hide an alleged &#34;hidden truth&#34; regarding O&#39;Connor&#39;s murder. 
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6620 can be treated using amnestics, though their effectiveness is not guaranteed. Should amnestics prove insufficient in treating SCP-6620, no action short of terminating the afflicted subject will mitigate the properties of the anomaly. Exposure to affected individuals often causes further spread of SCP-6620 as such personnel are likely to reveal pieces of information that are carriers for SCP-6620.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6620-01 designates an ongoing television broadcast consisting of various commercials and informational films pertaining to specific details of O&#39;Connor&#39;s homicide. Viewing SCP-6620-01 results in transmission of SCP-6620. The source of the broadcast is unknown.

&gt; +++ __ADDENDUM I: DOCUMENT 6620.01__
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; 
&gt; The following is a summary of the circumstances immediately prior to the homicide of Maria T. O’Connor (henceforth referred to as Victim). The current consensus is that Victim was murdered by a single unidentified male (henceforth referred to as Suspect). 
&gt; 
&gt; All events described below occurred on January 12, 2006.
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**9:32 AM:**## Victim departs her apartment on 32 West Rockheed Street and enters her 1999 Honda Civic, proceeding roughly 9.2km northeast along US Highway 114. Five minutes into the drive, Victim is called by a work colleague named Henry Weylan, who informs her that one of her projects has been delayed. This is the final time Victim is heard alive.
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**9:40 AM:**## Victim proceeds along Highway 114 until veering right onto Exit 8, approximately 1.3km away from her job at Thompson Insurance, Inc. It was unusual for Victim to take this exit given the fact that Exit 7 is closer to the company’s building, and other civilians in her vicinity described her driving as “erratic” — an unidentified driver claimed he briefly saw Victim through the leftmost window and stated she possessed minor facial bruising. 
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**9:42 AM:**## Victim arrives at an Exxon gas station, parking at Pump 3A. She does not exit her vehicle. After roughly 10 minutes, one of the station&#39;s customers notices that Victim is not moving and walks to her driver&#39;s side window to investigate. Victim lowers her window and speaks to the customer, informing them that she is &#34;unharmed&#34; and does not require assistance. Accepting this, the customer returns to their own vehicle. 
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**9:51 AM:**## Victim leaves her vehicle and walks inside the Exxon station store. She purchases the following items:
&gt; * One (1) bottle of engine coolant fluid 
&gt; * One (1) pack of Wrigley&#39;s gum 
&gt; * Five (5) &#34;Sharing Size&#34; packages of peanut M&amp;M&#39;s 
&gt; * One (1) grill lighter 
&gt; * One (1) tank of propane
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**10:13 AM:**## Victim departs the Exxon station, returning to Highway 114 and proceeding northeast toward Thompson Insurance, Inc. 
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**10:35 AM:**## A vehicle matching the Victim&#39;s is spotted by State Patrol Officer Michael Roarke driving 128.7kph (80 MPH), roughly 10kph over the speed limit. Roarke decides not to pull the vehicle over.
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**10:58 AM:**## Victim passes the exit for Thompson Insurance, Inc., continuing along Highway 114. Victim&#39;s shift was scheduled to begin at 11:00 AM.
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**11:16 AM:**## Assuming Victim is simply late for work, Henry Weylan again calls her, attempting to ask about her whereabouts. The call is not answered. Victim disables their GPS system, rendering further triangulation of their location impossible. Another driver claims to have seen Victim take Exit 4, which leads to the Green Pine State Park. 
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**11:23 AM:**## Victim&#39;s vehicle is captured by Green Pine State Park security cameras at the park&#39;s entrance. She drives forward, parks in a visitor parking lot, and exits her vehicle, proceeding into the park on foot. Victim takes her cell phone, the lighter, and the propane tank with her, leaving the snacks, the pack of gum, and her wallet. 
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**11:30 AM - 11:59 AM:**## By chance, Victim is captured during a live stream being conducted by an internet personality known for exploring state parks. He asks her why she is carrying a propane tank and what her intentions are, possibly fearing that she intends to commit vandalism. Victim does not respond to the inquiry and is seen walking off the trail, entering the surrounding woods. The streamer quickly reports this to park authorities.  
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**12:06 PM:**## Victim captures the first of several photographs prior to her death (see below).

-----

&gt; ##red|**12:21 PM:**## Victim types the following into her phone&#39;s &#34;Notes&#34; app: 
&gt; ||{{cant believe how u have grown. so proud 4 u. saw u today in green pine. u look very healthy. i am going to keep notes from now on 2 keep track of ur growth. i dont have much with me today but i can bring u more tomrrw. my muscles feel funny. might b 2 cold out here. will come back after i find u smthng}}||
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**12:36 PM:**## Victim is again called by Henry Weylan. The call is not answered. Noting that Victim&#39;s failure to respond to phone calls is highly unusual and she has never been late for a shift, Weylan contacts Victim&#39;s mother, suspecting she may have knowledge of her whereabouts. Victim&#39;s mother claims to have not seen her for roughly three weeks. Weylan subsequently calls several other relatives of the Victim, who provide similar responses.
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**12:38 PM:**## Through unknown means, Victim loses both of her upper canine teeth, which are found forcibly embedded in the bark of a tree. Based on the trail of blood leading from this tree further into the forest, it is assumed the injury was not fatal or incapacitating. 
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**12:55 PM:**## Victim presumably types the following into her phone&#39;s &#34;Notes&#34; app: 
&gt; ||{{cant find anything 4 u :( im sorry. gave teeth for now. will find something bettr. maria is ok. she is cold but will be ok. will take care of her. be back soon bby. }}||
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**12:59 PM:**## Victim types the following into her phone&#39;s &#34;Notes&#34; app: 
&gt; ||{{cant believe how u have grown. so proud 4 u. saw u today in green pine. u look very healthy. i am going to keep notes from now on 2 keep track of ur growth. i dont have much with me today but i can bring u more tomrrw. my muscles feel funny. might b 2 cold out here. will come back after i find u smthng}}||
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**1:07 PM:**## Local residents in the vicinity of Green Pine State Park report hearing crying and sobbing consistent with a human infant, albeit lower in pitch and speed. The volume of the noise is sufficient to be heard as far away as Boston, MA. Several seconds later, minor seismic activity is detected near Danvers, MA.
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**1:14 PM:**## Several 911 calls are made throughout Danvers, MA, consistently reporting infants and toddlers falling into a state of apparent unconsciousness. 
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**1:17 PM:**## Victim calls 911. The following is a transcript of the call:
&gt; -----
&gt; **Dispatcher:** //Danvers 911, what is your emergency?//
&gt; 
&gt; **Victim:** //Can -- [Unidentified noise] -- Can you hear me? Hello?//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dispatcher:** //Yes, ma&#39;am. I can hear you. What&#39;s your emergency?//
&gt; 
&gt; **Victim:** //I don&#39;t know where I am. I don&#39;t know where I am. There&#39;s trees around me. I think I&#39;m in a forest. I don&#39;t know how I got here -- there&#39;s something around me. I can&#39;t figure -- please, I&#39;m cold, it&#39;s cold out here, I don&#39;t know where I am or how I got here, I can&#39;t see --//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dispatcher:** //Please calm down, ma&#39;am.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Victim:** //Oh God -- I can&#39;t -- [Crying consistent with an infant] -- please get me out of here, please get me out, I&#39;m in a forest, I don&#39;t know where, please get me out. Please. Please. Please. [Sobbing] I don&#39;t want to be here, please help me --//
&gt; 
&gt; //[The crying becomes louder, accompanied by rapid footsteps.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dispatcher:** //Are you alone? What forest are you in? Do you remember anything about how you got there?//
&gt; 
&gt; **Victim:** //No. I&#39;m so scared. [Sobbing] I&#39;m so scared -- [Unintelligible] -- crying, he&#39;s crying, I don&#39;t know when he woke up and now he&#39;s crying --// 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dispatcher:** //Who woke up? Are you being followed?//
&gt; 
&gt; **Victim:** //[Screaming]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dispatcher:** //Ma&#39;am?// 
&gt; 
&gt; **Victim:** //[Screaming] -- help! Help me! Please -- please please help me --// 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Wet, tearing noises, followed by screaming and noises consistent with drowning.]// 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Call drops.]//

-----
&gt; ##red|**1:52 PM:**## Victim presumably types the following into her phone&#39;s &#34;Notes&#34; app:
&gt; ||{{maria is mean :( i dont knw what i did. she is not nice 2 me. maybe i can fix her. i can fix it. she is mommy. so nice. why is she not nice anymore. mommy? mommy? stop crying. pls dont cry. im sorry mommy. i can help u i can help u mommy pls dont cry im sorry mommy mommy mommy mommy mommy}}||
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**1:54 PM:**## Several individuals in Green Pine State Park report hearing a loud, female scream accompanied by the sounds of several infants crying and babbling incoherently. 
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**1:55 PM:**## Noises cease. 
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**2:40 PM:**## 
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**3:18 PM:**## Law enforcement discover Victim&#39;s remains. 
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**3:67 PM:**## Miracle.

&gt; +++ __ADDENDUM II: AUTOPSY REPORT 6620.02__
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; 
&gt; Victim&#39;s body was found entirely shaved, with the head, armpits, and pubic region entirely devoid of hair. There are various lacerations along the epidermis which seem to grow more severe towards the abdominal region. Body is entirely exsanguinated, possibly through self-inflicted injuries to the aorta before post-mortem mutilation. There are no internal organs present save for the brain. 
&gt; 
&gt; Small, cylindrical objects later identified as wooden twigs are embedded throughout the musculature. They appear to possess a general layout comparable to that of the victim&#39;s nervous system. Objects terminate at the brain, though partially protrude from the epidermis. Eyes are missing and replaced with severely damaged pinecones. 
&gt; 
&gt; Victim&#39;s uterus was found dislodged from the body, roughly 0.2km away from the rest of her remains. Uterus shows indications of being opened from the outside, possibly through use of a serrated instrument. Contents of uterus at time of recovery were various leaves, branches, and portions of tree bark. 
&gt; 
&gt; Following discovery of Victim&#39;s remains, SCP-6620-01 broadcasts adjusted to reflect the revelation that Victim was deceased, becoming dramatically more bizarre in their content (see example below).
