**Item #:** SCP-6620

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation agents are currently cooperating with several space agencies in order to prevent the public release of knowledge concerning SCP-6620&#39;s existence. The [[[SCP-6187 | Foundation Anomalous Space Telescope]]] is to monitor SCP-6620 at all times throughout its approach, while Site-19&#39;s IT Division have been tasked with identifying instances of SCP-6620-1 using facial recognition software.

Mobile Task Force Pi-205 (&#39;Comet Chasers&#39;) are to monitor instances of SCP-6620-1 following their return to Earth.

**Description:** SCP-6620 is an anomalous cometary body found in the inner solar system. SCP-6620 is significantly smaller than similar objects, the nucleus possessing a diameter of 12 meters, and the tail measuring around 10,000 kilometers in length. Telescopic observation has revealed SCP-6620 to be unusually luminous, and it is currently believed to produce its own light through unknown means.

Located on SCP-6620&#39;s surface are a 400mm telescope situated on a tripod stand, and a plastic lawn chair adorned with a single white cushion. These objects are stationary, and do not appear to be affected by SCP-6620&#39;s minimal gravitational pull.

With an orbital period of 7.14 years, SCP-6620 regularly comes within a distance of &lt;100,000 kilometers of the Earth. During perigee[[footnote]]The point wherein an astronomical object makes its closest approach to the planet Earth.[[/footnote]], a living human (designated SCP-6620-1) will vanish from their current location, and re-manifest atop SCP-6620. Instances of SCP-6620-1 show no effect whatsoever from temperature, vacuum or radiation exposure.

The selection of SCP-6620-1 appears to be entirely random, although subsequent background checks have shown all instances exhibit the following qualities:

* Low self-esteem
* High levels of anxiety and stress
* Discontentment with work
* Difficulty forming and maintaining social relationships

Instances of SCP-6620-1 typically remain on SCP-6620&#39;s surface for a duration of between sixty and ninety minutes. Once they have traveled a distance greater than three million kilometers from the Earth&#39;s surface, the subject will abruptly reappear at their previous location, retaining no recollection of the preceding events. 

Discrete monitoring of confirmed SCP-6620-1 instances in the months following has shown gradual changes in terms of personality and behavior. This includes increased confidence, lower aversion to risk, greater sociability and an interest in astronomy.
