**Item #:** SCP-PL-273

**Object Class:** Argus / Conscientia

**Special Containment Procedures:** All SCP-PL-273 instances currently reside beyond the Foundation&#39;s reach. Worldwide efforts to track them are ongoing.[[footnote]] **Argus:** Item&#39;s containment is under the purview of a third party. [[/footnote]] Should SCP-PL-273 be located, the [[[o4-s-summit|O4 Council]]] must immediately be informed so that it can decide the further course of action regarding the anomaly.

At the moment, SCP-PL-273&#39;s containment is focused on maintaining a disinformation campaign suggesting that the transfer of SCP-PL-273 did not occur, the instances themselves were not anomalous, and that they were intended to be scrapped due to their inability for further combat use.[[footnote]] **Conscientia:** Item must be considered non-anomalous by the public. [[/footnote]]

**Description:** SCP-PL-273 is a collective designation for 17 submarines, a frigate, a cruiser, and a destroyer, which previously belonged to and were built by the Navy of the Soviet Union.

Parts of SCP-PL-273&#39;s equipment and weaponry are either anomalously reinforced or based on anomalous technology. According to data recovered by the Department of Analytics, the installation of said technology was the result of collaboration between the Soviet Navy, GRU Division &#34;P,&#34; and KGB Division of Special Circumstances (DSC) as a part of the USSR&#39;s esoteric defense project during the Cold War.

Although the exact specifications of the equipment located in SCP-PL-273 are unknown --as the majority of Special Circumstances Division documentation has either been lost or intentionally destroyed -- it is known that among others, it includes: plasma projectors, thaumaturgically reinforced universal cannons, [[[two-between-the-eyes|LTK (Look-To-Kill) weapons]]], ontokinetically boosted anti-aircraft missiles, psionic targeting systems, and advanced memetic masking systems.

In 1990, all instances of SCP-PL-273 were sold by the USSR to PepsiCo as a form of barter payment for 3 billion US Dollars worth of Pepsi beverage syrup. For further information, see the Addenda.

**Addendum PL-273-1:** Discovery

The SCP Foundation has been long aware of SCP-PL-273 as well as other occult and anomalous Soviet weaponry projects. Despite this, due to the Cold War, the Foundation&#39;s research and espionage activities regarding these projects were significantly limited in order to maintain neutral relations with both sides of the conflict.

SCP-PL-273 came to Foundation&#39;s attention in 1990, when the worldwide media began to report on the renegotiation of the agreement between the USSR and PepsiCo regarding payment for the syrup of their product, which had been previously paid for with vodka due to the problems regarding the acceptance of the USSR currency aboard. Due to this, the fleet of ships was proposed as an alternative form of payment.

Furthermore, SCP-PL-273 -- which at the point was given an official SCP classification -- had been on the Foundation&#39;s watch list for some time, although the range of observations was limited due to the reasons mentioned above. Upon arriving in Vladivostok -- where the ships had previously been docked -- MTF Sigma-80 (&#34;Latający Dywan&#34;) reported that they were no longer there. Therefore it was decided to raid a local bureau of the KGB Division of Special Circumstances, which had been entrusted with the management of paranormal assets on ships according to recovered documentation by Foundation intelligence, but the bureau had already been deserted prior to the raid.

The whole situation raised a lot of suspicions, especially given the reports of corruption within the KGB DSC and the fact that the organization transformed into the still active paracriminal syndicate Scarlet Hammer after their dissolution in 1990 as a result of taking part in the failed August Coup.

**Addendum PL-273-2:** Department of Analytics&#39; Investigation

= __DEPARTMENT OF ANALYTICS INVESTIGATION__

INTRODUCTION:
@@     @@Due to the many inaccuracies and entertainments surrounding SCP-PL-273, the O4 Council has ordered the Department of Analytics to conduct an official wide-ranging investigation into SCP-PL-273 and the involved groups of interest. 

Dir. Simon Pietrykau formed a special team under his direct command -- due to his personal experience in the operation of Soviet anomalous organizations as a former GRU-P agent -- consisting of 20 Foundation analytics and 5 additional specialists from the Global Occult Coalition&#39;s PSYCHE Division[[footnote]] Sent at the request of the Coca-Cola Company, a member of Coalition&#39;s Council of 108 to &#34;help find evidence to sue [PepsiCo] before the International Court For the Paranormal&#34; [sic]. [[/footnote]] to look into the matter.

INVESTIGATION RESULTS:
@@     @@As of writing, the investigation has revealed a number of connections between PepsiCo and the KGB DSC operations, dating as far back as the 1970s. The company served as an intermediary and cover for the sale of illegal paraweaponry by corrupted DSC agents, although the exact details of those operations are currently unclear. Additionally, during the investigation, we were able to stumble upon evidence that connects companies with major stock owns in PepsiCo and Ruprecht Carter, one of the owners of [[[marshall-carter-and-dark-hub|Marshall, Carter and Darke]]].

His personal involvement in the situation is more than likely, especially given the fact that he carried out a large number of illegal financial operations with anomalous criminal organizations over the past few years, which significally contributed to the destabilization of the political situation in the USSR -- partially leading to its eventual collapse in 1991 -- which surely served his financial interests.

Yes, this means that Pepsi indirectly contributed to the collapse of the USSR, and SCP-PL-273 is only just the tip of the much bigger iceberg than we could initially assume.
