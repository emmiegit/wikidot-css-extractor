&gt; Recovery: Nagoya, Tokyo and Ise, Japan//

&gt; //Designation:EXC-410
&gt; Description: A long iron sword, rusted and deeply scratched, constructed in the Welsh or Mercian style, c. 5th century.  The haft was evidently encrusted with diamonds, topazes and jacinth, most of which are now missing.  The legend &#34;R.ART&#34; is inscribed on the hilt, and the word &#34;caledfwlch&#34; is inscribed in smaller lettering on the blade, near the hilt.
&gt; Recovery: Dozmary Pool, Cornwall, United Kingdom//

&gt; Recovery: Zahrgiah, Iran//

&gt; Recovery: Samarra, Iraq//

&gt; //Designation:DRK-1596
&gt; Description: A snare drum, decorated with a heraldic coat-of-arms.  Drum is dated to the late 16th century, and bears evidence of salt contamination consistent with long exposure to maritime environment.
&gt; Recovery: Buckland Abbey, England//

“Are the swords even sharp?”  “Not really, Doc.”  “Just… just throw that crap in the dumpster, then.  Keep the valuable-looking gems.”

The staff at Site-33 seemed to think that they had a keen wit when it came to nicknames.  Site-33 itself, of course, was “Rolling Rock”.  Its director, the bearded, bespectacled Dr. Sanders, was “the Colonel” (though never to his face).  And the building designated General Non-Anomalous Testing and Containment (GNATC) was “Granny’s Attic”.  If the Foundation was in possession of a specimen or an object that turned out to not be anomalous-that is to say, safer than Safe-well, it generally ended up in the Attic.  

------

&gt; //Designation: BDH-483
&gt; Description: A human left canine tooth, with trace amounts of ash of burnt sandalwood and pork proteins.
&gt; Recovery: Kandy, Sri Lanka//
“Who even brought  that thing here, the tooth fairy?  Trash, trash.”

------

In theory, things in the Attic (being non-anomalous and therefore not interesting) would eventually be processed in one way or another.  That glowing worm that turned out to be a bioluminescent animal unknown to science but otherwise uninteresting?  Released back into the cave where it had been found.  That tour bus of Mexican pilgrims to Guadalupe who had been contained on suspicion of having been infected by a dangerous meme?  Heavily dosed with amnestics and dropped off at the roadside.  Who knows, maybe some of them made it back home to the loved ones who had last seen them eleven years ago.

In theory.  In practice, processing non-anomalous items was the kind of duty that none of the Site-33 researchers seemed to ever really get around to doing.  There was too much interesting work to be done on the SCP-level objects, you see.  And so, an object in the Attic tended to stay in the Attic.

------

&gt; //Designation: HFR-019
&gt; Description: A live, healthy, unblemished cow, red in color.  All of the cow&#39;s hairs are absolutely straight.  
&gt; Recovery: ██████, Israel//
“Anybody want a burger?”

------

On February 7, Dr. Jerome Savonarola found himself in the Penalty Box.  The PB (officially, the “Processing Bureau”) was the office charged with running the Attic.  This office was normally vacant, but from time to time the Colonel would assign personnel there, more as penance or to get someone out of the way than in order to ensure the fulfillment of the duties of that office.  In this case, Savonarola had (according to the Colonel) bungled the containment protocol of Site-33’s colony of SCP-831.  (“How was I supposed to know that D-29934 had a loose dental filling?”).  Before the napalm had even been hosed away, it was “off to the PB with you, Jerry.  Maybe a tour of duty in the Attic for a few weeks will remind you to follow protocol to the letter.”

&gt; //Designation: IAGO-859
&gt; Description: A swallow-tailed canvas banner, suspended from a crossbar in an identical manner to the ancient Roman vexillum.  The banner was probably originally white in color but is heavily soiled.
&gt; Recovery: Santiago de Compostela, Spain//

&gt; //Designation: ARGO-001
&gt; Description: A sheepskin dated to the 8th century BCE, the wool intact being yellowish in color.  The sheepskin indicates that the ram had anatomical irregularities in the region of the scapula.
&gt; Recovery: Colchis, Republic of Georgia//

“Scribble-scrabble, a stinky shoe, rags and a wad of wool.  Ugh.  Pitch ‘em.”

------

Protocol to the letter.  Have it your way, Colonel.  As long as I’m here, I’ll follow the GNATC manual to the literal letter, just like that old passive-aggressive soldiers’ trick for coping with a martinet of an officer.  Particularly, Procedure TRS-β, which expressly requires the Site PB duty officer the duty to “expeditiously process  GNATC items with a view towards minimizing expenses of continued maintenance and storage.”  If they want me to take out the trash, that’s what I’ll do.

&gt; //Designation: LNG-1022-K 
&gt; Description: A Roman spear, dated to c. 1st century.  The blade of the spear is surrounded by a golden sleeve bearing Latin text and affixing an iron nail to the blade.

&gt; //Designation: ARJ-1000-503-580-500-100-L

&gt; Recovery: ███████, China.//
“Sticks and stones.  Charming.  Dumpster.  Keep the gold, though.”

------

As it turned out, the Penalty Box could be surprisingly cathartic.  A few more dumpster-loads, and there’d be nearly enough room in here for a squash court.


&gt; //Designation: MOR-1823-I
&gt; Description: A collection of rectangular plates, approximately 26 kg in total mass.  The plates are comprised of gold and are extensively inscribed in a dialect of Egyptian used in the Western hemisphere between approximately 2600 BCE and 421 CE.
&gt; Recovery: Cumorah, New York.//
“Gold, again.  More of it, this time.  Melt it down, and put the resulting ingots in the trunk of my car.  I, er, have some research in mind.”

------

&gt; //Designation: INRH-27-32-66-D
&gt; Description: A collection of fragments of cedar, pine and cypress wood which, when re-assembled, comprise two beams, the first being approximately 3.7 meters in length and the second being approximately 2 meters in length, with the two beams having an aggregate mass of approximately 75 kg.  The collection also includes iron nails.  There is residue of vinegar and human blood on the nails and some of the wood fragments, with the blood matching that from CLX-1337-A.
&gt; Recovery: Various locations.  Largest single fragment recovered from Gishen Mariam, Ethiopia.//

&gt; //Designation: CLX-1337-A
&gt; Description: An olive wood cup, dated to 1st century B.C. Analysis indicates trace residue of Levantine grape wine, myrrh and human blood in the cup. An Aramaic-language inscription reads &#34;Joseph of Arimathea&#34;. The letters &#34;GALAH&#34; appear roughly carved near the base, with the style of lettering indicating a pre-Norman British origin.
&gt; Recovery: [DATA REDACTED]//
“Incinerator.  Why are you looking at me like that?”
