**Item #:** SCP-6139

**Object Class:** 

**Special Containment Procedures:** 

SCP-6139 is allowed to continue their work as a level three researcher at site-██, on request that they do not look at any reflective surfaces, on punishment of janitorial duty. Instances of SCP-6139-1 are to be incinerated and any liquids cleaned by janitorial staff [[footnote]] if an instance of SCP-6139-1 is found outside the site, SCP-6139 is to call MTF Alpha-45 (‘Janitors’) for assistance in cleanup. [[/footnote]]. Revision(s): SCP-6139 is not allowed to own any vehicles with windows, nor are they allowed to own glasses of any sort. Any cellular devices they own are to be spliced so that the camera does not function.


**Description:** 

SCP-6139 describes researcher █████, particularly the phenomena that occurs when they see a reflection of themself [[footnote]] i.e, a mirror, glass or water [[/footnote]]. When SCP-6139 perceives themself in any reflective surface, a corpse of a seemingly random civilian manifests in close proximity to SCP-6139. [[footnote]] such corpses now referred to as SCP-6139-1 [[/footnote]]] All corpses manifested in this way have similarities such as having two or more lacerations on one or both wrists, occasional blunt force head trauma, lacerations on various other body parts [[footnote]] such as stomach, chest, head, neck, or legs [[/footnote]]. All corpses have at least thirty percent of their blood removed from their body. Approximately seven seconds after an instance of SCP-6139-1 manifests, a message on whatever reflective surface SCP-6139 perceives [[footnote]] see addendum-1 for a list of transcribed messages [[/footnote]]. Said messages are always directed at or for SCP-6139 [[footnote]]  see interview log-1 [[/footnote]].

**Interviewed:** SCP-6139

**Interviewer:** Dr. █████

**&lt;Begin Log, [optional time info]&gt;**

**Dr. █████:** So how long has this been happening?

**SCP-6139:** About a week? Maybe a bit more, hard to tell with dead bodies appearing out of fucking nowhere.

**Dr. █████:** Come on Tav, I know the semantics are shit, but try to keep it professional.

**SCP-6139:** Fine, I’ll try not say ‘fuck’ as much.

**Dr. █████:** Thanks. Now do you have any idea why these messages are as…

//[four second pause]//

**Dr. █████:** Specific? As they are?

**SCP-6139:** Not entirely sure, but it&#39;s weird because whenever it happens it usually tells me about something I’ve forgotten, like to do laundry, or exercise, stuff like that.

**Dr. █████:** Hah, we all know you, of all people, need reminders.

**SCP-6139:** Oh eat shit, what happened to ‘keeping this professional’.

**Dr. █████:** Fair enough. Well that’s all I had on the docket for today. I’m ending this interview.

**SCP-6139:** See you at lunch?

**Dr. █████:** If you don’t forget.

**SCP-6139:** Oh fuck yo-
