**Item #:** SCP-6321

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6321 is currently being contained within a Secure Humanoid Containment Cell with an airlock and added soundproofing in Research Sector-04 at SCP Site 42. The airlock is not to be opened unless necessary. No attempts should be made to move the SCP into an object containment cell. SCP-6321 is sentient and should be handled with the same respect as one would a humanoid SCP.

SCP-6321 should be handled with extreme caution. Should any testing of SCP-6321 be required, it should be done silently. The silence may upset SCP-6321. Under no circumstances should it be engaged casually.

SCP-6321 may become greatly distressed and demand an audience. In such a case, the security feed from its containment cell is to be fed into the break room with muted audio, and red light is to flash at the end of each piece it plays to cue applause, which will be fed back into its cell. Under no circumstances is the volume to be turned on. SCP-6321 should not be given a live audience, as it would put them at risk of psychic entrapment. No attempts should be made to play SCP-6321, as it finds this very upsetting.

**Temporary Containment Procedures**: //(see Addendum 6321.5)// Any personnel slated to work in the vicinity of SCP-6321 //must// go through a one-session course on the procedures involved in working with SCP-6321 to supplement our reading materials. 

**Description:** SCP-6321 is a B. Shoninger Louis XV Piano [[footnote]] The B. Shoninger Louis XV was known as one of the most elaborate and beautifully carved pianos of all time. They were produced from 1850 to 1929[[/footnote]]with the capacity of speech. It is 3.14m in height with 60 cm in depth, made of walnut wood with intricate carvings. While it seemed to be well cared for in its prime, there is some decoloration from white to yellow to its keys. Foundation Researchers have attributed this to age. Upon the SCP&#39;s request, restoration efforts have been planned for when it is safe to proceed with them. 

Foundation Researchers believe SCP-6321 produces speech by playing itself and uses the tone and pitch frequencies of its notes to produce words. Based on recent findings, Researchers believe there could also be a psychic component to its communication. Investigation on this matter is currently underway.

SCP-6321 is believed to have some form of a psychic hold on those with whom it converses. Its communication privileges are currently under an indefinite suspension. As such, it //should not be engaged// unless necessary. SCP-6321 is well-mannered. It is not aware of the damage it could cause or how it causes it and does not fully understand or respect the rules the Foundation has set in place for it.

 After Incident-6321.1 //(see Addendum 6321.5)//, SCP-6321 is to have limited human interaction. SCP-6321 does not appear to have any ill intent and does not seem conscious that it is causing harm. It claims to be a performer //(see Addendum 6321.1)// that enjoys playing pieces of all genres. It is quick to learn and will cater to its listener&#39;s interests. 

SCP-6321 has demonstrated evidence of putting a psychic hold on those it interacts with. This hold gets stronger with every subsequent interaction. In extreme cases, SCP-6321 psychically binds conversation partners to itself so strongly that they have no will to leave or provide themselves basic care. SCP-6321 does not have a concept of time nor does it realize the state of its listeners until they are removed, at which point it expresses great disappointment. Given that it does not comprehend what has happened to its audience or its role in the situation, it does not express remorse.

**Addendum 6321.1:** History
Through what Foundation Researchers were able to glean from a video from //Cryptid Crusaders// as well as details SCP-6321 has divulged about its life, Foundation Researchers believe SCP-6321 to contain the spirit and/or soul of Harold Turner, a prominent piano player of his time (circa the 1920s). Turner was especially popular in his home state of New York. His home piano and piano of choice for intimate performances and/ or practice was a B. Shoninger Louis XV. In 1939, at the age of 38 years old, he was diagnosed with cancer of the liver. Shortly after, he passed. 

While Foundation Researchers have no definite answer as to how Mr. Turner ended up in a piano, urban mythology may have a few explanations. The first says that the piano was a gift and had //always// exhibited some strange qualities. Turner used to claim he would lose track of time and play it obsessively for hours. Friends and relatives noted that there were times where Mr. Turner would simply sit in front of the piano for hours unmoving, as though in a trance. This leads researchers to believe that perhaps the piano was anomalous even before Mr. Turner&#39;s spirit was trapped in it. Another myth says that members of Mr. Turner&#39;s family practiced some form of magick, though his involvement is unknown. This myth states that knowing he was dying and not feeling ready, Mr. Turner performed a soul-transference ritual so that he could live forever in his piano doing what he loved: performing. Whether either of these explanations have merit is unknown, though both do have strong parallels to findings by Foundation Researchers.

**Addendum 6321.2:** Discovery
SCP-6321 came to the attention of the Foundation through a vlog done by a group of students who called themselves the //Cryptid Crusaders// [[footnote]]//Cryptid Crusaders// were a group of supernatural vloggers. It consisted of three members: Owen, Grady and Chad. All three were 24-year-old caucasian males with blonde hair (eye colour is unknown due to their tendency to wear sunglasses). It is the opinion of more than a few Researchers who are familiar with the group that they may not have been entirely qualified to investigate the supernatural. They have a small cult following on Youtube, primarily consisting of youth ages 13-18.[[/footnote]], published on YouTube and several supernatural forums. It was found in the basement of a Century Home (███ ████████ ██) and appeared not to have been touched since the house&#39;s previous owner had passed. Researchers found the film footage of what was supposed to be a follow-up video. The students had allegedly gone inactive, and the footage was never posted. It was later revealed that all three had died in a car crash reportedly caused by fatigue. Since SCP-6321 seemed fond of younger people and was extremely compliant, the Foundation assigned a young researcher, Dr. Katarina Wilson, to run the initial investigation. 

The following is a transcript of Dr. Wilson&#39;s initial interview with the subject.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Initial Interview**

**Interviewed:** SCP-6321

**Interviewer:** Dr. Katarina Wilson, Site 42

------
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Open&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
**Foreword:** Initial interview of SCP-6321 (AKA Harold Turner)

**&lt;Begin Log, 10/10/2021 11:25 AM&gt;**

**Dr. Wilson:** Good afternoon. My name is Dr. Katarina Wilson, and-

**SCP-6321:** //(interrupting, excitedly)// Hello! Oh, thank god you&#39;re here. I was getting so lonely!

**Dr. Wilson:** //(caught off-guard, sympathetic)// Oh. I&#39;m so sorry! How long have they kept you unattended?

**SCP-6321:** I&#39;m not sure. It seems like ages, though. 

**Dr. Wilson:** I can imagine. I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re not a fan of being alone?

**SCP-6321:** No, quite the opposite. I&#39;m quite the social butterfly- or at least I consider myself to be.

**Dr. Wilson:** I can&#39;t say the same. I&#39;m a bit of an introvert. 

**SCP-6321:** I&#39;ve always wondered what that must be like. 

**Dr. Wilson:** I mean, I don&#39;t know how to describe it. People just tire me out. But... I&#39;m not here for small talk.

**SCP-6321:** Oh?

**Dr. Wilson:** Well, I kind of have things I have to check. This is my job.

**SCP-6321:** Your job?

**Dr. Wilson:** I&#39;m a researcher at The Foundation. SCP. There are a few names we go by.

**SCP-6321:** //(Pause)// I&#39;ve never heard of you.

**Dr. Wilson:** No, and you wouldn&#39;t have. Anyways, I have some questions prepared.

**SCP-6321:** Ask away! I am more than happy to be of assistance.

**Dr. Wilson:** All right. First, in your own words, what are you?

**SCP-6321:** My name is Harold Turner, and I&#39;m a pianist.

**Dr. Wilson:** A pianist trapped in a piano. That&#39;s a funny parallel.

**SCP-6321:** I think the word trapped is a bit strong. I don&#39;t feel trapped.

**Dr. Wilson:** How would you describe your state then?

**SCP-6321:** Living. I am continuing my life from inside a piano.

**Dr. Wilson:** Do you know how you got in there?

**SCP-6321:** Yes. Well, sort of.

**Dr. Wilson:** Can you describe it?

**SCP-6321:** You see, that&#39;s the one thing I can&#39;t talk about!

**Dr. Wilson:** Why?

**SCP-6321:** It stops me!

**Dr. Wilson:** It?

**SCP-6321:** I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s the most I can say.

**Dr. Wilson:** That&#39;s all right. We get weird quirks like that here all the time. All right. Next question. In your words, what do you do? Other than playing the piano, of course.

**SCP-6321:** Well, I talk. 

**Dr. Wilson:** //(laughing)// Yes, I can see that.

**SCP-6321:**  I can talk about a lot of things. Art, music, politics, popular culture, fashion...

**Dr. Wilson:**  Is that all you do?

**SCP-6321:** To my knowledge.

**Dr. Wilson:** //(Pause)//All right, one more question, but it might be upsetting.

**SCP-6321:** Go ahead. 

**Dr. Wilson:** Do you know where the students you talked to went?

**SCP-6321:** What?

**Dr. Wilson:** Well, we found you from a video made by some students. They called themselves the //Cryptid Crusaders//...

**SCP-6321:** Yes, I remember them! Lovely young boys.

**Dr. Wilson:** They&#39;ve disappeared. 

**SCP-6321:** Well that&#39;s horrible!

**Dr. Wilson:** We were hoping you might know where to find them? All we have is the raw, unedited footage of their final conversation with you. They left their camera behind.

**SCP-6321:** I&#39;m sorry. They didn&#39;t mention going anywhere.

**Dr. Wilson:** It&#39;s ok. I mean, why would they? //(pause)// Thank you //(pause)// should I call you Harold?

**SCP-6321:** Well, it is my name.

**Dr. Wilson:** Right. Thank you, Harold. That concludes my interview.

**SCP-6321:** Before you go, could I interest you in a show tune or two?

**Dr. Wilson:** Oh, I&#39;m not supposed to...

**SCP-6321:** How about some Chopin?

**Dr. Wilson:** While I do love his work, I can&#39;t. It wouldn&#39;t be professional of me. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have ample opportunity to hear you play in a professional capacity in the future.

**SCP-6321:** All right. Then I shall have to wait until then. 

**Dr. Wilson:** I guess so. I&#39;ll see you soon, Harold. 

**SCP-6321:** You know where I am if you ever want to talk!


**&lt;End Log, 10/10/2021 11:33 AM&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Dr. Wilson scheduled a series of audio-frequency tests to take place the next day.
[[/div]]


**Addendum 6321.3** Observations

The following are a record of some of Dr. Wilson&#39;s tests [[footnote]]A clear pattern can be seen in Dr. Wilson&#39;s test times. She spent progressively more and more time with to subject for each test. This was also a trend with the //Cryptid Crusaders// during their filming.[[/footnote]] and notes. 

__**Test A - October 11, 2021**__
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Start Time:** October 11, 2021 9:32 AM

**End Time:** October 11, 2021 12:35 PM

**Subject:** SCP-6321

**Procedure:** SCP-6321 conducted a conversation with the test administrator while the test administrator measured the pitch, frequency and wavelength of its speech. These were compared with human speech and the sonority of the same make of piano. 

//** Conversation Transcript**//:
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Open&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

//Note: Most of the recording of this conversation was lost.//

//**Dr. Wilson:** Good morning, SC- Harold. Sorry, I forgot for a moment there that you had a name.//

//**SCP-6321:** Good morning, Katarina!//

//**Dr. Wilson:** You remembered my name?//

//**SCP-6321:** Of course I did! You&#39;re the only person I&#39;ve met here so far. It wasn&#39;t too hard.//

//**Dr. Wilson:** (chuckling) I am the only researcher assigned to you. It&#39;s still a nice gesture, Harold. Thank you.//

//**SCP-6321:** You&#39;re more than welcome. What brings you to my humble abode?//

//**Dr. Wilson:** My first test. I want to monitor certain aspects of your speech to try and figure out how precisely you&#39;re able to communicate with me.//

//**SCP-6321:** Oh, that sounds exciting! What do you need me to do?//

//**Dr. Wilson:** I&#39;ve set up some devices to monitor pitch and frequency... and we&#39;re simply going to talk.//

//**SCP-6321:** I am more than happy to do that.// 

//**Dr. Wilson:** (chuckling) I&#39;m sure you are.//

//**SCP-6321:** Did you have any particular conversation in mind?//

//**Dr. Wilson:** No... but I&#39;ve prepared conversation cue cards if you think those might be beneficial. I can start with-//

//**SCP-6321:** (cutting her off) No need. I&#39;d love to get to know you a little, Katarina. Especially since we&#39;re going to be spending time together.//

//**Dr. Wilson:** (apprehensive) I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m allowed to divulge personal details to you- we haven&#39;t determined your danger class yet.//

//**SCP-6321:** Do I seem dangerous to you?//

//**Dr. Wilson:** No. But those boys... although we have nothing concretely tying their fate to you.//

//**SCP-6321:** Really, who am I going to tell if you divulge a few secrets?//

//**Dr. Wilson:** This conversation is being officially recorded... Though unless anything extreme happens, I&#39;ll probably be the only one to listen to the recordings. So I suppose... I could tell you a little about myself. If it would make you feel more comfortable.//

//**SCP-6321:** It most certainly would.//

//**Dr. Wilson:** All right... erm... well... can you see me?//

//**SCP-6321:** No. But I can feel you, in a sense.//

//**Dr. Wilson:** Intriguing. I might have to follow up on that sometime soon. Uh... so that you know, I&#39;m a red-head, and I keep my hair long so that I can wear it in a bun. I&#39;m kind of short- five feet three inches. I&#39;ve got green eyes. I am wearing-//

//**SCP-6321:** As lovely as it is to know what you look like... I&#39;m more interested in your personality. What do you like, Katarina?//

//**Dr. Wilson:** (hesitantly) I&#39;m a Class C personnel here at the Foundation, but I&#39;m hoping that my work with you might help me to improve my standing. I&#39;m a bit of a dork for fantasy. I write poetry sometimes. I play D&amp;D with some friends from college every Saturday. That&#39;s... my only regular social visit, I think. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m quite quaint. I&#39;m very shy- I already told you I&#39;m an introvert.//

//**SCP-6321:** You seem very sweet.//

//**Dr. Wilson:** I&#39;m flattered you think so.//

//**SCP-6321:** Now poetry... that can be quite the romantic art. Are you writing it for anyone in particular?//

//**Dr. Wilson:** (she hesitates) I was until very recently.//

//**SCP-6321:** I&#39;m guessing things didn&#39;t end amicably?//

//**Dr. Wilson:** They most certainly did not...//

//**SCP-6321:** That can be very difficult. But if you&#39;re asking me, I think he&#39;s the one missing out.//

//**Dr. Wilson:** (apprehensively) He said I was too &#34;clingy&#34;.//

//**SCP-6321:** In other words, you were committed to the relationship.//

//**Dr. Wilson:** (passionately) That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying! But he never understood that. I-//

//Unfortunately at this point in the experiment, the audio of the conversation abruptly cut off. Whether or not it was destroyed or otherwise interrupted is unknown. Total minutes of conversation lost were 168.73//
[[/collapsible]]

**Results:** SCP-6321 has a closer sound profile to that of its piano counterpart than human speech. 

**Analysis:** It would be reasonable to believe that what we register as &#39;speech&#39; from SCP-6321 is produced by a calculated mixture of notes and pitches produced by the piano. 
[[/div]]
__**Test B - October 12, 2021**__
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Start Time:** October 12, 2021 9:33 AM

**End Time:** October 13, 2021 12:34 AM

**Subject:** SCP-6321

**Procedure:** An examination was done of SCP-6321&#39;s interior to see if there were any anomalous appendages and/ or other biological fixtures that might not be visible to the naked eye that aid in its communication. 

**Results:** No such appendages were found. 

**Analysis:** It seems that there is ample evidence to assume that SCP-6321 is a physically normal piano. 
[[/div]]
__**Test C - October 14, 2021**__
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Start Time:** October 14, 2021 9:34 AM

**End Time:** October 15, 2021 11:12 PM

**Subject:** SCP-6321

**Procedure:** SCP-6321&#39;s EMF (Electromagnetic Field), temperature, and radiation readings were monitored over the course of two days.

**Results:** Radiation levels remained at zero. EMF trended upwards during the conversation, with occasional jumps when the subject was provided conversational stimulus. The temperature remained at a steady level of 50^^o^^F even when attempts to raise the room temperature were made by the administrator.

**Analysis:** Usually a higher EMF reading is an indication of a stronger paranormal/psychic figure, while lower ones indicate a weaker paranormal figure. The administrator of this test would like it noted that they have never seen EMF readings on a suspected paranormal being grow with interaction. This might be an indication of the SCP&#39;s capacity to strengthen with human interaction or with human presence in the room. 
[[/div]]
__**Test D - October 17, 2021**__
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Start Time:** October 17, 2021 9:32 AM

**End Time:** October 19, 2021 12:09 AM

**Subject:** SCP-6321

**Procedure:** An array of standard psychiatric evaluations were run on the subject.

**Results:** The subject seems completely clinically sane. 

**Analysis:** SCP-6321 seems to be amicable, and harbours no ill-will. He is capable of a diverse range of human emotions and human comfort. 
[[/div]]

**Addendum 6321.4:** Researcher&#39;s Notes

Below are some of Dr. Katarina Wilson&#39;s notes on SCP-6321, commenting primarily on his behavior and character. [[footnote]]There is some debate among researchers as to whether Dr. Wilson was of sound mind while writing these notes given her exposure to SCP-6321. Her findings are research are of sound logic, however, the degree of affection shown in these notes leads some researchers to question whether or not she may have still been under the influence of SCP-6321 while writing them. Results on this hypothesis are currently inconclusive.[[/footnote]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

//In my current experience, SCP-6321 prefers to be called Harold or Harry. If there must be formalities, he will also accept Mr. Turner. He does expect to be treated with humanity, even in his state, and frankly, I don&#39;t blame him. He&#39;s more human than many people I know and certainly more alive. I have gotten a lot of exposure to Harry while trying to decipher his state- which is a complex matter about which I have only been able to hypothesize about thus far. As a specialist in cases like Harold&#39;s, I believe I have made some very good headway into how precisely Harold can communicate with us. It&#39;s how he wound up in a piano that&#39;s posing some difficulties. I am currently in the process of determining my next steps in experimentation given what information I have, but I wanted to write a log on his behaviour and demeanour, as these are factors that might not be perfectly represented in my interview logs and test results.//

//Harold Turner is genuinely one of the best people I have ever had the pleasure of interacting with. I have no reason to believe that he has any ill intention, nor that he has the capacity for it. He is very talkative, but that&#39;s likely because it&#39;s one of two things he can do- the other being playing music, which he is also excellent at. He has been able to adapt and learn some of my favourite songs (which he had never heard) in minutes. More importantly than that, though, Harry is an excellent listener, and he&#39;s grown to be as wise as one might expect someone of his age to be. I will admit that in the process of administering some of my tests I have had conversations that were not professional in nature with Harry, and during each of those, he was attentive and compassionate. I will even go so far as to say that he has helped me through a lot, as I believe this provides evidence of how amicable the SCP is.//

//This being said, I don&#39;t think that Harold poses any risk whatsoever- not to any of our researchers or the public. If the decision were entirely mine to make at this point, I would classify him as Disruption Class Dark and Risk Class Notice. I might even go so far as to say that he is just about as harmless as [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-999 SCP-999]. Once I have finished my official conclusions, I think I will take on a side project of figuring out a way to make him more mobile. Being alone in a cell seems to be disheartening for him, and I genuinely believe it would do both him and the community at SCP a lot of good for him to be allowed to wander. I hope it isn&#39;t unprofessional to say that I would like to continue my work with Harold for as long as is possible. We seem to have forged a bond unlike any I&#39;ve had before. Of course, I do not let my newfound affection for him influence my work, and so far it has not had any effect on my findings. I wanted to log this officially because I think that the emotional capacity of this SCP should be taken into consideration when decisions as to his class, rights and privileges are being made.//

**Addendum 6321.5** Investigative Interview

Dr. Wilson deemed it necessary to interview the SCP concerning its past and how this factored into its current state. Below is a transcript.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Interview for Historical Evidence**

**Interviewed:** SCP-6321 (Harold Turner)

**Interviewer:** Dr. Katarina Wilson, Site 42

------
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Open&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
**Foreword:** Dr. Wilson interviews Mr. Turner about his life in advance of his entrapment in a piano.

**&lt;Begin Log, [20/10/2021 9:30 AM]&gt;**

**Dr. Wilson:** Good morning, Harry. 

**SCP-6321:** Katarina! Ready for another round of tests?

**Dr. Wilson:** I ran dry of justifiable ideas for tests. Even that last one was a stretch, Harry, and we both know it. 

**SCP-6321:** Then what are you here for?

**Dr. Wilson:** An interview. I wanted to talk.

**SCP-6321:** Is this official, or a personal visit?

**Dr. Wilson:** It&#39;s official. I can&#39;t do personal visits with you yet- not with so much still up in the air. We&#39;re still waiting on an official classification for you on all three fronts. I genuinely hope my notes from that last test are taken seriously because they&#39;d help the case of me being about to see you more casually. 

**SCP-6321:** I completely understand, Katarina. You don&#39;t need to be so-

**Dr. Wilson:** //(chuckling, cutting him off)// Tense. I know. You keep saying that. 

**SCP-6321:** Well I don&#39;t want you hurting yourself!

**Dr. Wilson:** I know. I appreciate your concern.

**SCP-6321:** So, how can I help you today?

**Dr. Wilson:** I wanted to ask you a bit about your life before... your current living situation.

**SCP-6321:** //(chuckling)// Have I not provided you with enough stories during your tests?

**Dr. Wilson:** You&#39;ve certainly given me a great deal to work with, but I&#39;d love to know more. So we&#39;re going to have a guided conversation about what I think might help me in my research.

**SCP-6321:** I&#39;ll do my best to provide you with what you need, but you know I have limitations around what I can divulge about my state.

**Dr. Wilson:** I know. And I&#39;ll try to avoid those areas. First and foremost... tell me about your family.

**SCP-6321:** I was raised by my mother, with two sisters- one older than me and one younger. It&#39;s how I know so much about how to behave around women. My mother was a nurse and ran a small apothecary of sorts where she sold homemade remedies. She more or less got into that trade because my younger sister was prone to illness. I don&#39;t know how she did it, but her natural cures worked wonders. [[footnote]]SCP-6321&#39;s Mother&#39;s (Lottie Turner&#39;s) Black Book has since been found among Harold Turner&#39;s estate.[[/footnote]]

**Dr. Wilson:** Intriguing... your mother was a scientist of sorts?

**SCP-6321:** Indeed she was- which is why I so appreciate your work.

**Dr. Wilson:** //(teasing)// Come now, Harold. We both know flattery will get you nowhere with me. 

**SCP-6321:** //(also teasing)// Well I might as well try, given the opportunity.

**Dr. Wilson:** You mentioned her cures doing &#34;wonders&#34;. Would you go so far as to call these wonders anomalous?

**SCP-6321:** I can&#39;t answer that. 

**Dr. Wilson:** Do you think your mother may have been a practitioner of... please know I mean no, offence, but-

**SCP-6321:** //(cutting her off)// I can&#39;t answer that, Kat.

**Dr. Wilson:** Come on, Harry! You&#39;ve got to work with me here!

**SCP-6321:** I&#39;m sorry! But if it helps in confirming any of your suspicions, I will say this: I&#39;ve had to very delicately mince my words because we are verging on the territory of //things I cannot talk about//.

**Dr. Wilson:** That helps a great deal. Thank you, Harold. Let&#39;s move on to something you may be able to talk more about.

**SCP-6321:** Please.

**Dr. Wilson:** At what age did you begin playing the piano?

**SCP-6321:** I believe I was seven years old. 

**Dr. Wilson:** A fairly standard age. Were you playing on this make of piano at that time?

**SCP-6321:** Oh yes. In fact, it was this exact piano! It was a gift from my mother for my birthday.

**Dr. Wilson:** So your mother had access to the piano before you ever played it?

**SCP-6321:** Yes. 

**Dr. Wilson:** Do you think she-

**SCP-6321:** Careful, Kat. If you want answers, you don&#39;t want to go in that direction.

**Dr. Wilson:** Right. Am I right in assuming there&#39;s a //reason// I won&#39;t be getting an answer to that question?

**SCP-6321:** Yes. I have my suspicions that there is.

**Dr. Wilson:** Thank you. Now... as for the urban mythology...

**SCP-6321:** I think that covered one front of it, did it not?

**Dr. Wilson:** It did. I want to know a bit about the other front. And I know I&#39;m going to need to word this-

**SCP-6321:** //(cutting her off)// Very carefully. Otherwise, I&#39;m not going to be able to give you anything. 

**Dr. Wilson:** I know, Harry. So I&#39;m gonna put it in a way I think you might be able to answer fully.

**SCP-6321:** If anyone could figure out a way to do that, it would be you. Your wit still astounds me!

**Dr. Wilson:** I&#39;m a scientist for a reason, Harold. All right... Here goes. If I were to ask you the question, in theory, of whether or not you used your mother&#39;s witchcraft to eternally transfer your soul into this piano once you knew you were terminally ill... would you be able to answer it.

**SCP-6321:** Not entirely. That&#39;s a complex one.

**Dr. Wilson:** Good to know.

**SCP-6321:** I will tell you that the actual circumstances are... much more expansive than the myth. 

**Dr. Wilson:** Thank you, Harry.

**SCP-6321:** I wish I could help more. I know you&#39;re trying very hard to figure me out.

**Dr. Wilson:** That, and perhaps what happened to those boys.

**SCP-6321:** I genuinely don&#39;t know what happened with them. I wish I did.

**Dr. Wilson:** I know, Harry. I hope I can convince the Foundation of that fact. It would also work towards normal conversations between us becoming more accessible without me constantly having to experiment on you.

**SCP-6321:** I don&#39;t mind the experiments. They don&#39;t cause me any pain.

**Dr. Wilson:** No, I know... It just feels invasive doing it so often. Especially with you. It feels wrong.

**SCP-6321:** Well, so long as you&#39;re here, could you perhaps stay a little after this interview is over?

**Dr. Wilson:** I&#39;m not supposed to. And I&#39;ve got this recording in an official capacity.

**SCP-6321:** Couldn&#39;t you just... turn off the recording and stay?

**Dr. Wilson:** That would be //extremely// unprofessional of me.

**SCP-6321:** But you could?

**Dr. Wilson:** I suppose... I could also be fired.

**SCP-6321:** For a few minutes? Wouldn&#39;t the Foundation appreciate you providing comfort to me, given my state? You know I hate being alone.

**Dr. Wilson:** I... I could probably get off with a warning if it&#39;s a one-time thing.

**SCP-6321:** You were //just// about to tell me about the last season of Wentworth before you left yesterday.

**Dr. Wilson:** Yeah- although I should probably wait to tell you about //that// until next week when the final episode airs... Eric [[footnote]]The &#39;Eric&#39; mentioned here is believed to be Eric Walker, whom Dr. Wilson had been dating for exactly 25 months before their relationship ended. There is evidence that he may not have been entirely faithful to Dr. Wilson.[[/footnote]] called again last night. 

**SCP-6321:** Oh no...

**Dr. Wilson:** Just give me a second to-

**Closing Statement:** It is assumed that at this point Dr. Wilson stopped the recording. This was the last known log by Dr. Wilson.

**Addendum 6321.6:** Incident-6321.1

After the prior interview, Dr. Wilson neglected to leave SCP-6321&#39;s containment cell for three days. The current hypothesis as to why this happened is that she was transfixed on the conversation she was having with the SCP by psychic means. Testing protocols on this hypothesis are currently being determined. Due to a lack of nutrition and hydration during this timeframe, Dr. Wilson passed. Dr. Wilson had booked the two days following their final interview with the subject as vacation days. The assumption had been made by her superiors that she had forgotten to clock out before these. No loud or unusual noises had emerged from SCP-6321&#39;s containment cell to indicate any unusual activity, and the security feed showed an empty room for the entire period. It has since been discovered that Dr. Wilson tampered with the security feed, presumably so that she could continue her conversation without consequence. Her body was found by Dr. █████ when they were asked to check on SCP-6321 in her absence. Below is an interview by Dr. Morris with SCP-6321 shortly after this discovery. The interview was supervised by Dr. Bloom to ensure the safety of Dr. Morris.

**Post-Mortem Interview: Case of Katarina Wilson**

**Interviewed:** SCP-6321

**Interviewer:** Dr. Erol Morris, Site 42

**Foreword:** Interview with SCP-6321 in lieu of the death of their primary researcher.

**&lt;Begin Log, 24/10/2021 12:00 PM&gt;**

**Dr. Morris:** SCP-6321-

**SCP-6321:** //(cutting him off)// You&#39;re not Katarina.

**Dr. Morris:** I am //not// Dr. Wilson, that is correct. 

**SCP-6321:** You&#39;re not that nice boy from yesterday either. Is Katarina going to be back soon? I miss her.

**Dr. Morris:** //Dr. Wilson// is deceased.

**SCP-6321:** I beg your pardon?

**Dr. Morris:** She&#39;s //dead//. And we have reason to believe you were instrumental in her passing.

**SCP-6321:** There has to be some sort of mistake. Kat isn&#39;t dead. She&#39;s on vacation! She was just telling me about the trip she was going to take to her parent&#39;s cottage. Right about now, she&#39;s probably jet skiing on the lake she backs onto. She-

**Dr. Morris:** //(cutting it off, agitated)// She isn&#39;t jetskiing. Dead girls //can&#39;t jetski//. 

**SCP-6321:** She was just here...

**Dr. Morris:** She died yesterday.

**SCP-6321:** Yesterday?

**Dr. Morris:** You should have been witness to it.

**SCP-6321:** We were talking...

**Dr. Morris:** Was //she// talking? Or were you?

**SCP-6321:** Well... I suppose I carried the later part of the conversation a bit. But that was only because I was telling her about the time I won a competition and got to play Carnegie Hall! I bumped into-

**Dr. Morris:** I&#39;m not interested in your performance career. What I&#39;m interested in is what you did to Dr. Wilson.

**SCP-6321:** Me? I did nothing. 

**Dr. Morris:** Can you summarize what you and Dr. Wilson did during the last 72 hours of her life?

**SCP-6321:** 72 hours? Is that really how long it was?

**Dr. Morris:** That was the suspected length of her visit with you before she passed.

**SCP-6321:** It flew by... she came in to conduct an interview.

**Dr. Morris:** We have that on file. I can&#39;t remember the exact length of it off the top of my head, but it couldn&#39;t have been longer than ten minutes. What happened after that?

**SCP-6321:** Well... we started by talking about her ex-boyfriend, Eric. Did she ever tell you about him? He was a real dolt, dropping her after two years because she was more emotionally dependant on him than he was on her //and then having the nerve to call her as though//-

**Dr. Morris:** //(cutting it off, frustrated)// I don&#39;t need... //(taking a breath)// I don&#39;t need you to regurgitate the finer details of Dr. Wilson&#39;s love life, though it&#39;s unfortunate that she was going through that. 

**SCP-6321:** My apologies. Should I keep to the barebones of what our conversation covered?

**Dr. Morris:** Did you just... talk the entire time?

**SCP-6321:** We certainly did! We talked about Eric for a long while, then she told me about the vacation she was taking to take her mind off of him- and honestly good for her. Her family&#39;s cottage has such a rich history, and it seems like it&#39;s in such a beautiful area! Then I asked her if she was inviting any friends from work, and the poor thing said she had none! She was very new, you know. And shy. So shy. She said she was so busy with work that she hadn&#39;t had time to introduce herself to anyone, but I think she was just too nervous. She had high hopes for this job, you know. She was working hard so that one day she might be able to head a research team. She said I was the first SCP she&#39;d gotten to lead research on.

**Dr. Morris:** That&#39;s true. You were her first SCP. By all indications, you were benign. This shouldn&#39;t have happened.

**SCP-6321:** She&#39;d hoped that if she did well with me... well, she hoped a few things. She was hoping she could prove I was as benign as everyone assumed, and perhaps a proper friendship between us would be more accessible. But she also hoped that maybe it would help her work her way up in the organization. That she could be making a real change in the world. She told me about her line of work, and what she was hoping to specialize in.

**Dr. Morris:** It was some branch of linguistics, right?

**SCP-6321:** I think she referred to it as audio linguistics? She described it as figuring out how anomalous objects surpass their state to communicate. I didn&#39;t understand much else she said in regards to it, but it was so clear from her tone that she loved it. And then we got talking about whether there were specializations in music. And... I suppose that&#39;s when I took the lead in the conversation. We talked about my piano experience, my performance careers, how much I loved to play rags- especially Joplin. God, I loved Joplin. He knew how to write a tune. And I got into how I performed at Carnegie, and I met his niece once... and then I asked a question and she didn&#39;t answer. I figured she might have had to leave and I simply hadn&#39;t heard.

**Dr. Morris:** //(after a pause)// It seems like you knew her very well.

**SCP-6321:** She was a very dear friend to me. This is incredibly tragic.

**Dr. Morris:** It is. She was young too. //(pause)// But, uh, anyway... Do you remember doing anything that could have put her in danger?

**SCP-6321:** I just talked to her. Like we&#39;re doing now.

**Dr. Morris:** Dr. Wilson noted in one of her tests that your EMF seemed to strengthen as your conversation progressed, but she never noted if this was because of a conscious effort on your front...

**SCP-6321:** What&#39;s an EMF?

**Dr. Morris:** Electromagnetic field.

**SCP-6321:** I still don&#39;t know what that means.

**Dr. Morris:** Is there any sort of //ability// you might have that you concealed from Dr. Wilson?

**SCP-6321:** I never concealed anything from Kat. She was my best friend. My //only// friend. 

**Dr. Morris:** I wish we had a way to tell if you were lying... 

**SCP-6321:** Why are you asking me this?

**Dr. Morris:** Why am I asking you what?

**SCP-6321:** Why are you asking me all these questions about abilities and E-M-F? I mean I could understand the questions about what Katarina and I were doing before she died because I was the last one to see her. 

**Dr. Morris:** Katarina died of dehydration.

**SCP-6321:** How awful!

**Dr. Morris:** She didn&#39;t drink any water in the three days she talked to you.

**SCP-6321:** That seems irresponsible of her.

**Dr. Morris:** We... Currently, the hypothesis is that she didn&#39;t have the //capacity// to drink any water. She was too busy being locked in a conversation with you.

**SCP-6321:** That&#39;s ridiculous! I wish she had told me she wasn&#39;t drinking- I couldn&#39;t exactly see her. I would... I would never want her to not hydrate for my sake.

**Dr. Morris:** We believe that you gain a psychic hold on those you converse with, forcing them to focus only on you.

**SCP-6321:** What?

**Dr. Morris:** It&#39;s the only explanation we&#39;ve got based on Kat&#39;s research and the evidence you&#39;ve provided us. 

**SCP-6321:** Are you saying I killed Kat?

**Dr. Morris:** Yes. Whether that was intentional or not-

**SCP-6321:** //(cutting him off, aggressive)// I didn&#39;t kill Katarina! I would //never// kill Katarina!

**Dr. Morris:** I&#39;m not saying that you did it intentionally. Based on the conversation we&#39;ve had today, I&#39;d tend to lean towards the death being unintentional.

**SCP-6321:** //(frantically, getting louder)// There has to be some mistake here. I&#39;m not a killer. I don&#39;t kill people!

**Dr. Morris:** //(calmly)// This seems to be a pattern for you. This is almost precisely the same scenario as what happened with the //Cryptid Crusaders//. 

**SCP-6321:** You mean the boys? Did you find them?

**Dr. Morris:** We&#39;ve known where they were since a day after Dr. Wilson started her investigation. They&#39;re dead. They crashed their car the night after they finished filming their follow-up video with you. 

**SCP-6321:** No...

**Dr. Morris:** I&#39;m afraid so. I&#39;d imagine that Dr. Wilson neglected to tell you to spare your feelings. I&#39;m... not particularly in the mood to mince my words. 

**SCP-6321:** Are you saying I killed them too?

**Dr. Morris:** At first, it looked like maybe they&#39;d just been irresponsible, but now... do you remember how long your last conversation with them was?

**SCP-6321:** I have no clue.

**Dr. Morris:** They had likely talked to you for //days// before they left, which would imply they hadn&#39;t slept in a very long time. 

**SCP-6321:** That&#39;s not my fault. 

**Dr. Morris:** It //is// your fault. 

**SCP-6321:** It is //not//!

**Dr. Morris:** It is. It doesn&#39;t have to be intentional to be your fault.

**SCP-6321:** //(frantically, louder)// There has to be some mistake. I could never kill... I&#39;m not a killer.

**Dr. Morris:** You //could//. And it&#39;s looking like you //did//, whether you wanted to or not.

**SCP-6321:** No...

**Dr. Morris:** I&#39;m sorry if that is a hard pill to swallow, but-

**SCP-6321:** //(louder, irrate)// No!

**Dr. Bloom:** Dr. Morris, that&#39;s enough for today. 

**Dr. Morris:** We had a few more things to-

**Dr. Bloom:** That&#39;s enough. Conclude the interview.

The following interview between SCP-6321 and Dr. Bloom took place a month after the death of Dr. Wilson.

**Dr. Bloom:** Good morning. Dr. Wilson&#39;s notes indicate that you prefer to be called Harold?

**SCP-6321:** That&#39;s right. It&#39;s my name. Am I not owed that decency?

**Dr. Bloom:** With everything that has happened recently in consideration, you aren&#39;t owed //anything//, Harold. 

**SCP-6321:** What&#39;s happened recently?

**Dr. Bloom:** You killed Dr. Wilson.

**SCP-6321:** I already told you that //wasn&#39;t me//.

**Dr. Bloom:** //(a pause)// Ah. I see you&#39;re still in denial. Fair enough, given your relationship with the deceased. 

**SCP-6321:** Katarina was my friend. I would never-

**Dr. Bloom:** //(cutting him off)// It&#39;s alright. Let&#39;s not point fingers. How have you been feeling since we suspended your communication privileges?

**SCP-6321:** It&#39;s been hellish.

**Dr. Bloom:** Elaborate?

**SCP-6321:** I am a social creature, Dr...

**Dr. Bloom:** Bloom. Dr. Cheryl Bloom. 

**SCP-6321:** I am a social creature, Cheryl. Without that interaction, I am nothing. This cage has felt a lot smaller.

**Dr. Bloom:** I feel like that might have been a bit hyperbolic, but your sentiment came through loud and clear. Have you had any time to consider your actions on October 23rd?

**SCP-6321:** My actions?

**Dr. Bloom:** Precisely what happened on the day Dr. Wilson died?

**SCP-6321:** I&#39;ve already told you what happened! We had a conversation! That is all that happened! She died of dehydration.

**Dr. Bloom:** I know...

**SCP-6321:** I didn&#39;t dehydrate her. Therefore I didn&#39;t kill her. 

**Dr. Bloom:** I can see that this is still a touchy subject.

**SCP-6321:** You&#39;re accusing me of killing my best friend! That&#39;s deeply upsetting!

**Dr. Bloom:** Then I won&#39;t linger on the topic any longer.

**SCP-6321:** I would appreciate it. Perhaps you&#39;d indulge me... I haven&#39;t had a proper conversation in ages.

**Dr. Bloom:** I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t provide you with one. Your communication privileges are still suspended. 

**SCP-6321:** Then I suppose you should be on your way.

**Dr. Bloom:** I have one last inquiry, Mr. Turner.

**SCP-6321:** Go on, if you must.

**Dr. Bloom:** I was only going to ask if you had any other comments or remarks on the matter.

**SCP-6321:** You already know my sentiments on the matter. There&#39;s nothing more for me to say other than I miss dear Katarina, and I&#39;m lonely in her absence.

**Dr. Bloom:** Thank you, Harold. That will be all.
