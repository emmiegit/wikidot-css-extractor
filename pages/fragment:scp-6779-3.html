&gt; **Footage Type:** Offical SCP Foundation CCTV Footage
&gt; 
&gt; **Location:** Site-950
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; {{The following footage takes place over the course of several hours and utilizes CCTV footage from multiple points within Site-950. A change in CCTV camera will be noted each time it occurs.}}
&gt; 
&gt; //(Microbial Research and Related Developments Lab CCTV)//
&gt; 
&gt; Ten minutes and fifty seven seconds after SCP-6779 is initially discovered near the entrance to Site-950, a second multicolored sock monkey, several times larger than SCP-6779, is seen entering the building through a window in the Microbial Research and Related Developments Lab. In comparison to SCP-6779, it possesses a larger &#34;belly,&#34; a larger head, and longer arms and legs; which are approximately 70 centimeters in length.
&gt; 
&gt; It is seen wearing a small balaclava covering everything except its &#34;eyes.&#34; It is also wearing a small paper cutout mustache, which is taped on the outside of the entity&#39;s balaclava. It is carrying a large empty cloth sack with a large green &#34;$&#34; emblazoned on its side, which it holds by taping it to its left hand with duct tape. The entity is hereafter referred to as SCP-6779-1.
&gt; 
&gt; Upon entering the building, SCP-6779-1 appears to survey its surroundings for several seconds before wandering the room, occasionally picking up small items to gain a closer look. [[footnote]]SCP-6779-1 picks up items by coiling its entire arm around the object.[[/footnote]] SCP-6779-1 hears several site personnel approaching the room to investigate the sound of the broken window. This causes SCP-6779-1 to open a filing cabinet and forcefully shove itself inside. 
&gt; 
&gt; Junior Researcher Bradford opens the door to inspect the source of the noise but does not discover SCP-6779-1. Before he can investigate further, a small group of people surrounding SCP-6779 pass through the hallway behind him. He succumbs to its compulsion effect and follows the rest of the group.
&gt; 
&gt; Several seconds pass and SCP-6779-1 exits the filing cabinet, proceeding to take as many small items as it can and placing them into its cloth sack. SCP-6779-1 takes the following items:
&gt; 
&gt; * Three pens
&gt; * Twelve pencils
&gt; * Two pencil sharpeners
&gt; * Dr. Anna&#39;s personal journal
&gt; * One snowglobe
&gt; * One box of cotton swabs
&gt; * Researcher Jerry&#39;s car keys
&gt; 
&gt; After this, it leaves the room into the hallway.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Floor 2 Hallway #6 CCTV)//
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6779-1 slowly walks through the hallway, attempting to not be detected by any onsite personnel. SCP-6779-1 notably does not attempt to enter any room with a closed door. It is presumed this is because SCP-6779-1 is not physically strong enough to open doors.
&gt; 
&gt; It eventually finds the entrance to Junior Researcher Cathy&#39;s office, which was slightly open at the time. SCP-6779-1 squeezes through and enters the office.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Junior Researcher Cathy&#39;s office CCTV)//
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6779-1 wanders the room in search of items it deems valuable. It grabs several and places them into its bag over the course of several minutes before noticing Cathy&#39;s desk. It climbs onto Cathy&#39;s chair and then directly onto the desk, where it notices Cathy&#39;s purse. It begins to search the purse. 
&gt; 
&gt; After taking out Cathy&#39;s smartphone, wallet, car keys, picture of her wife and chap stick, it notices a small plastic button that was once a part of Cathy&#39;s button up sweater vest. SCP-6779 appears to be very intrigued by this item and frantically attempts to place it into the bag but cannot due to its small size. After several minutes of attempting to pick it up with one arm, SCP-6779-1 grabs the purse and hangs it upside down over the cloth sack, dumping all of its contents into it, including the button. The following items were taken by SCP-6779-1:
&gt; 
&gt; * Three pencils
&gt; * One &#34;Fantasy Creatures &amp; Mystical Lands&#34; coloring book
&gt; * Thirty seven colored pencils of various colors
&gt; * One small ball of lint
&gt; * Two empty soda cans
&gt; * One half empty soda can
&gt; * The contents of Junior Researcher Cathy&#39;s purse (with the exception of smartphone, wallet, car keys, picture of her wife, chapstick and actual purse)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6779-1 then immediately exits the room into the hallway.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Floor 2 Hallway #6 CCTV)//
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6779-1 runs through the hallway back towards where it came. A loose vent grate is seen near SCP-6779-1. Before it can advance further down the hallway, SCP-6779-1 notices two site personnel on the other end of the hallway, who are Junior Researchers Janet and Gus. Gus appears to be carrying a small cake that was purchased from a nearby grocery store. Before they notice SCP-6779-1, it quickly removes the grating from the nearby vent and climbs inside. This is the last time SCP-6779-1 is seen for several hours.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Floor 1 Staff Break Room CCTV)//
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6779 is seen in a baby carriage in the middle of the first floor break room, surrounded by a group of site personnel, all of whom are carrying various toys and foods in an attempt to please SCP-6779, which is looking back and forth through the room. Junior Researcher Alfred speaks up.
&gt; 
&gt; **Alfred:** Hey guys, guys, listen, I know what&#39;ll cheer the baby boy up! Let&#39;s play Peek-A-Boo, my kids love playing that, I don&#39;t see why he wouldn&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; All the personnel agree to this and put down any object that they were holding at the time and cover their faces with their hands. Each personnel repeatedly ask SCP-6779 &#34;where am I&#34; and other variations of the question before all simultaneously putting their hands down and yelling &#34;Peek-A-Boo!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; On their 11th &#34;round&#34; of Peek-A-Boo, SCP-6779 notices the sound of a nearby vent grate being removed, revealing SCP-6779-1 in said vent. SCP-6779 waits until all the site personnel&#39;s hands are covering their faces before exiting the baby carriage and making its way towards the vent with SCP-6779-1. Once it enters the vent, SCP-6779-1 places the vent grate back into its original position.

Researcher Jerry&#39;s 2010 Toyota Venza was found fifty seven kilometers from Site-950 in an off-road ditch. It is theorized that SCP-6779 and SCP-6779-1 used the vehicle as a means to escape Site-950&#39;s premises quickly. It is unknown how the entities effectively operated the vehicle.
