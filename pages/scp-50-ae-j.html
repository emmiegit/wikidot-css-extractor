**Item #:** SCP-50-AE-J

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-50-AE-J is to be kept in a steel box locked with a padlock and wrapped in an American flag. The box containing SCP-50-AE-J is to be kept away from the following: Russian literature, radios, the Pope, first generation Russian immigrants, and pictures of Ronald Reagan. In case of [REDACTED] security staff are to begin humming the Star Spangled Banner while weeping a single tear.

**Description:** SCP-50-AE-J is an IMI Desert Eagle, with an American flag print grip. SCP-50-AE-J is unremarkable except for the fact that when fired, an adult bald eagle, designated SCP-50-AE-1, emerges from the barrel and attacks anyone who displays Communist beliefs, Russian ancestry, or unpatriotic leanings. SCP-50-AE-1 differs from a normal bald eagle specimen in that it not only appears to be able to detect sociopolitical beliefs, but also can talk, usually screaming slogans such as &#34;Better dead than red&#34; and &#34;Democracy is non-negotiable&#34;. Investigations into the further properties of SCP-50-AE-1 have been stymied by the fact that SCP-50-AE-1 continues to attack Foundation scientists, calling them &#34;PINKO FUCKS&#34;.

**Test Log: SCP-50-AE-J**

**Test #1:** SCP-50-AE-J was fired at a Class-D test subject, D-1409. SCP-50-AE-1 emerged, and savaged D-1409, while yelling &#34;UP YOUR LEBENSRAUM YOU UBERMENSCH FUCK&#34;. D-1409 was later discovered to be of predominantly German heritage, but was a 2nd generation American immigrant with full citizenship.

**Discoveries:** SCP-50-AE-1 appears to be able to distinguish genetic and racial information in its targets. SCP-50-AE-1 also appears to have a profound dislike of Germans. D-1409 is to be incinerated entirely, after his testicles are recovered from SCP-50-AE-1.

**Test #2:** SCP-50-AE-J was fired at Class-D test subject D-6554. SCP-50-AE-1 emerged, and following its usual pattern of behavior, disemboweled D-6554 while simultaneously screeching &#34;The only good communist is a communist with his guts held in my dripping claws&#34;. D-6554&#39;s death was later discovered to have been hastened by anaphylactic shock from an allergic reaction, caused by particulates in his lungs found to be consistent with matter from [REDACTED]. A follow up investigation confirmed that D-1409 had performed a test involving [REDACTED], shortly before testing with SCP-50-AE-J began.

**Discoveries:** SCP-50-AE-1 is a consistent entity, and appears to be summoned rather than created when SCP-50-AE-J is fired. Research into effects this could have upon containment are ongoing.</textarea></pre>
