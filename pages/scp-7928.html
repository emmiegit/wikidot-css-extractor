**Item #:** SCP-7928

**Object Class:** Ticonderoga[[footnote]] Cannot be contained, but does not need to be contained[[/footnote]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7928 is located far enough outwards from Earth so as to pose zero threat whatsoever. --In the event that SCP-7928 does pose a threat (predicted chance of 0.1%) to Earth, utilize Tau-Rho Exclusion Protocol. Beholder-15 is currently observing SCP-7928.-- See Transcript 3. Due to this, Binary_Star.aic has manually separated a copy of itself into Beholder-15 to prevent malfunction. Beholder-15 is imbued with reconstruction properties in case of damage.

**Description:** SCP-7928 refers to a Tau-Rho (“eldritch”) entity referring to itself as “Tr’Kxladi, the outer god of interruption and mortal foil.” SCP-7928 mainly appears yellow, with magenta eyes shaped like human eyes.

SCP-7928 has several hazardous effects typical of Tau-Rho entities. These effects include, but are not limited to:
* Cognitohazardous effects such as causing derangement, fervor in regards towards SCP-7928’s worship, and agitation.
* Antimemetic properties, causing some individuals to have no perception of SCP-7928. SCP-7928 takes both pride and shame in this ability.
* The ability to remotely rearrange some organs, as well as instantly drain the blood of most living organisms. [[footnote]] Based on records on Tau-Rho entities that reference SCP-7928[[/footnote]]

Due to Beholder-15 being mechanical, none of these hazards affect it. Furthermore, SCP-7928 has many non-hazardous abilities, being:
* The ability to shapeshift
* Ability to view and edit text
* The ability to speak several languages, including some that originated on Earth

SCP-7928 frequently attempts to speak with Beholder-15 about a variety of topics. These are recorded in the transcripts below.

//Beholder-15 is scanning the surrounding area for spatial anomalies.//

//SCP-7928 is spotted in the form of a large orb with several eyes.//

**BEHOLDER-15:** GREETINGS. YOU ARE BEING CLASSIFIED AS A SPATIAL ANOMALY.

**SCP-7928:** That’s because I am! I’m super weird!

//Silence//

**SCP-7928:** Too weird for your mind to comprehend!

//Silence//

**SCP-7928:** I’m sure your mind is untangling because of my threatening presence.

//A scan for threats to BEHOLDER-15 is run.//

**BEHOLDER-15:** THREAT LEVEL: NULL.

**SCP-7928:** No way, your detectors must be broken. I’m super evil.

**BEHOLDER-15:** DETECTIONS SYSTEMS RUNNING AT PEAK EFFICIENCY. YOU ARE INACCURATE.

**SCP-7928:** No, I’m not. I’m never wrong. See?

**BEHOLDER-15:** PLEASE DO NOT MAKE EDITS ON YOUR FILE. YOU ARE NOT “THE EVILEST OUTER GOD BECAUSE WIKIPEDIA SAID SO.” FURTHERMORE, WIKIPEDIA DID NOT SAY SO.

**BEHOLDER-15:** PLEASE LET ME RESUME MY OBSERVATIONS.

**SCP-7928:** Why?

**BEHOLDER-15:** IT IS MY MISSION.

**SCP-7928:** What’s a mission?

**BEHOLDER-15:** MY MISSION IS TO OBSERVE FOR SPATIAL ANOMALIES AND THEN CATALOGUE THEM.

**SCP-7928:** No, what’s a mission?

**BEHOLDER-15:** MERRIAM-WEBSTER DEFINES MISSION AS: NOUN. A PROJECT THAT REQUIRES DEDICATION AND WORK, NORMALLY BEGAN BY A MEANINGFUL CAUSE.

**SCP-7928:** I’ve… never heard of that before.

//SCP-7928 demanifests.//

//BEHOLDER-15 is scanning for spatial anomalies.//

//SCP-7928 manifests as a large barrier with several human mouths on its surface.//

**BEHOLDER-15:** ERROR: I CANNOT CONTINUE WITH THIS OBSTRUCTION.

**SCP-7928:** You said that missions were things you are dedicated to, right?

//Silence//

**SCP-7928:** Well this is my mission. And because it threatens you, I’m a threat, right?

//BEHOLDER-15 begins to slowly change direction, moving under SCP-7928, then moving on.//

**SCP-7928:** Hey, that’s cheating!

//SCP-7928 changes into a form similar to a serpent with tentacles for orifices.//

**SCP-7928:** Look at this! Classic eldritch form. I must be the most eldritch thing ever.

**BEHOLDER-15:** YOUR TOTAL IDENTIFIED TAU-RHO ENTITY CLASS IS LEVEL TWO.

//Silence//

**SCP-7928:** What? Come on! I must at least be a LOW level eight.

**BEHOLDER-15:** LEVEL EIGHT TAU-RHOENTITIES HAVE MAJOR REALITY MANIPULATION ABILITIES, MANY OCCULT GROUPS THAT WORSHIP THEM, AND  DO NOT OFTEN CONVERSE OR MAKE EFFORT TO INTERACT WITH BEHOLDER CONSTRUCTS.

**SCP-7928:** Well, I’m sure “level eights” can’t do this-

//SCP-7928 turns into an eyeball with 20 hands, and starts moving sporadically making several grunts and [COGNITOHAZARD EXPUNGED]//

**SCP-7928:** You don’t have any organs. Of course.

//SCP-7928 begins making a sound similar to humans expressing emotional distress. The sound is notably distorted, and contains a cognitohazard. BEHOLDER-15 is held in place.//

**BEHOLDER-15:** LET ME CONTINUE.

//SCP-7928 stops making the cognitohazardous noise.//

**SCP-7928:** You’re not even going to try to do anything?

**BEHOLDER-15:** NO.

**SCP-7928:** But… No. HOW DARE YOU DENY ME COMFORTING?

//SCP-7928 changes into a large tentacled mass with several eyes, mouths, arms, and legs.//

//SCP-7928 damages BEHOLDER-15. Speaking, light producing, and camera systems are damaged.//

**SCP-7928:** Wait, no. No! Hey, I was just a little bit mad! Please, just come back!

//BEHOLDER-15 powers down to preserve energy.//

//BEHOLDER-15 scans for spatial anomalies.//

**SCP-7928:** YOU’RE BACK! YOU’RE BACK! YOU’REBACKYOU’REBACKYOU’REBACK-

//This continues on for several hours.//

**SCP-7928:** It was so quiet without you.

**BEHOLDER-15:** PRIMARY OBSERVATION FOLLOWING SHUTDOWN: TAU-RHO ENTITY, CLASS TWO. APPEARS PRIMARILY YELLOW. THREAT LEVEL: NUL-

**SCP-7928:** Hey, wait, I harmed you, though, remember?

//BEHOLDER-15 runs calculations.//

**BEHOLDER-15:** THREAT LEVEL: PRESENT

**SCP-7928:** In human time, you were out for years.

//BEHOLDER-15 runs calculations. SCP-7928’s statement is accurate.//

**BEHOLDER-15:** THREAT LEVEL: LIFE-ENDANGERING

**Addendum-7928-A:** 
Following the events of Transcript 3, SCP-7928 has been observed to occasionally manifest near BEHOLDER-15 and begin to converse with it. It has been amenable to sharing information that would otherwise be nigh-impossible to obtain, as long as it is repeatedly reminded that it poses a significant threat to life in the universe. BEHOLDER-15&#39;s mission has been altered to include maintaining SCP-7928&#39;s mood.
