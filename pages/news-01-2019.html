There were three categories for entrants to submit tales, SCPs, or GoI Formats into, having to choose one or more of the following elements:

__**5 Chosen Anomaly Clichés:**__

* Compulsion effect that makes you do bad things/kills you.
* Spooky scary murder monster(s)!
* An anomaly so helpful/harmless, the Foundation lets it roam the Site and has minimal containment procedures. Being helpful/harmless is optional.
* A doorway of any shape to a different dimension/timeline/world.
* An item that is very good at doing the thing its supposed to do -- //too// good, in fact.


__**5 Chosen Story Element Clichés:**__
* A highly skilled Mobile Task Force gets steamrolled.
* An interview in which the anomaly is overly cryptic, followed by the interviewer suffering.
* (GoI/PoI here) gets one over the Foundation, making them look like fools in the process.
* Termination attempts.
* D-Class = Disposable Class

You will notice little &#39;📈&#39; emojis besides some articles. That denotes SCP articles which were under 30 and tales which were under 20 when this edition of site news was posted. Give them a little love! Speaking from personal experience, the most frustrating thing that can happen to an article is not deletion, but stagnating below 20 without any comments. So try to read, vote, and comment on these articles! They&#39;re often hidden gems :)

+* Q&amp;A:

++* Q: Can I replace a blurb that you wrote for one of my articles with my own? I&#39;m not satisfied with it.

A: Absolutely. You will always have that option at any point.

++* Q: I noticed an error/typo/incorrect information and wish to correct it. May I?

A: Sure! If the changes are not limited to your own article(s) and/or are substantial changes across multiple entries, you should post in that month&#39;s discussion page and then make the changes.

++* Q: I wrote an article and it seems to have stuck. Can I send a blurb of mine to one of the frequent collaborators?

A: Yup! It&#39;s much easier if you come to us about it, and it gives you the control over what you want shown on the news page.
