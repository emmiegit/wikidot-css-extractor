**Interviewed:** [[[SCP-214]]]

**Interviewer:** Researcher ██████

**Foreword:**  Initial interview to ascertain the origin of SCP-214

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Researcher ██████:** I&#39;d like you to tell me again about what happened at the library.

**SCP-214:** Library, home sweet home. Have you been to the periodicals section?  Such a lovely place, glittering with the dewy webs of knowledge strewn across the indexes.

**Researcher ██████:** Home? Do you mean like a metaphysical home, or did you actually plan to live there? We show your address of record as [REDACTED].

**SCP-214:** I&#39;ve always been there. I&#39;m still there. Home is where the Library is, after all. And this is my home now, isn&#39;t it?   So this is the Library now.  It&#39;ll be a fine one too, once I get everything organized.

**Researcher ██████:** What do you remember of before the library? Do you remember your name? Do you remember why you were sent to the library?

**SCP-214:** Oh, my name is SCP-214, isn&#39;t it?  Filed and stored away with so many other texts. I greatly admire your work. You hold so many beautiful things here.

**Researcher ██████:** That&#39;s your designation, yes. Do you remember what it was?

**SCP-214:** Designation, a distinguishing name. Yes. I know it.  Do you remember what yours is?

**Researcher ██████:** Of course, it&#39;s ██████, but I&#39;m not the one answering the questions here. Do you remember what happened at the library between when you arrived and you were found?

**SCP-214:** Are you sure? Because you told me it was Alicia   before. Some times, people lose themselves and I wouldn&#39;t want that to happen to you. It&#39;s for your own good that you know  yourself. What happened? What always happens in a Library. Knowledge was exchanged.

**Researcher ██████:** Alicia? What, no. You&#39;re attempting to change the subject. What knowledges were exchanged in the library? With whom? Reports suggested ██ people inside engaging in some kind of synchronized ritual, but when we showed up, you were the only one there. What happened to the rest of the people, 214?

**SCP-214:** I already told you. Knowledge was exchanged.  Everything is information, to be stored and sorted. Compressed, if need be.

**Researcher ██████:** Stored where? There were no traces of any other individuals inside that building when the recovery team arrived, but you were covered in [long pause] the unknown sample.

**SCP-214:** Oh Alicia, you do have such a limited view of things here. You ask the wrong questions. You already know where. They&#39;re in the Library. They never left.

**Researcher ██████:** My name isn&#39;t... we did a thorough search of the library. You were the only one inside. We didn&#39;t even pick up DNA traces; someone or something had swept it clean. Tell me what happened in the library. What happened to those seventeen people, T... 214?

**SCP-214:** You keep confusing the map for the territory Alicia. It is a bad habit. They&#39;ve been indexed in the Library, stored, numbered and sorted.

**Researcher ██████:** You... you don&#39;t mean the building, do you? When you talk about the Library?

**SCP-214:** You do good work here.  We work at complimentary purposes. To secure, protect and contain. To organize, quantify and enlighten. You are so bright, Alicia. Just a few more steps now.

**Researcher ██████:** Can you... can you show me the Library?

**SCP-214:** Of course I can.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Researcher ██████ was found after the interview inside SCP-214&#39;s enclosure, leaking silvery fluid from [REDACTED].
