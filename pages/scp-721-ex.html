**Item #:** SCP-721-EX

**Object Class:** --Keter-- Explained

**Special Containment Procedures (Archived):** As the effects of SCP-721-EX only manifest in the presence of Agent O&#39;Hare, every Valentine&#39;s Day she is to be isolated within a secure location at least 100 kilometers from Site-19 that is [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4559 randomized] each year. This location is not to be disclosed to any Site-19 staff without exception. If an individual is afflicted by SCP-721-EX for more than 24 hours, they are to be given Class A amnestics and kept under surveillance during the holiday.

**Description (Archived):** SCP-721-EX is a virulent memetic hazard that causes any exposed Foundation personnel to believe that Agent Jacqueline O&#39;Hare of MTF Lambda-5 (&#34;White Rabbits&#34;) is objectively their chosen &#34;valentine&#34; every February 14th to a degree of manic insistence despite their affiliation and relations (or lack thereof) to Agent O&#39;Hare, regardless of romantic or platonic connections to others.

Effects of SCP-721-EX include, but are not limited to:
* An overwhelming desire to procure Valentine&#39;s Day gifts and love letters for Agent O&#39;Hare (addressed to &#34;My jackrabbit&#34;, &#34;My bunny&#34;, or otherwise).
* Mobs of staff swarming her with confessions of romantic or platonic love, desperately asking for dates and physical intimacy.
* As well as, in one case, a physical altercation over who would grab her a cup of coffee that resulted in a small scale riot within Site-19&#39;s cafeteria.

After the holiday, 90% of afflicted individuals recover within 24 hours with any attachments to Agent O&#39;Hare returning to their previous state. Of the 10% who would remain afflicted for longer periods, the attraction would remain consistent to that of the memetic effect and were susceptible to having a more intense experience with each year left untreated.

**Addendum 721-EX.1:** Discovery

In an originally innocent effort to boost staff morale, Alexandra.aic was modified on 14/2/2022 with a minor program allowing Foundation personnel to be amusingly assigned another staff member as a valentine for the holiday. The program utilized a recurrent neural network analyzing non-classified documents and communications to find recurring connections between staff, meant to connect them based on status, relations, similarities, and personality.

Despite thousands being employed at Site-19, approximately 68% of personnel were simultaneously assigned Agent O&#39;Hare as their valentine. While the results of the program were to be taken in jest, an unknown secondary effect occurred in which many of those affected truly believed Agent O&#39;Hare was actually their romantic partner and acted as such. It is believed that neither Agent O&#39;Hare or the program caused SCP-721-EX&#39;s effects, as O&#39;Hare claimed to have had no knowledge of how many people were assigned to her, and the personnel she had been assigned to was never disclosed to the public.

During SCP-721-EX&#39;s manifestation, Agent O&#39;Hare was incredibly flustered over the mass amount of affection she was receiving. She stated it was extremely difficult for her to traverse the site or to be left alone, going so far as to having to barricade herself in her office to avoid countless love confessions. Due to this, she was unable to respond with MTF Lambda-5 to a containment breach that resulted in five casualties. As security staff and the remaining 32% of personnel who were unaffected were unsuccessful in regaining control of the facility, Agent O&#39;Hare was isolated, the program was removed, and Class A amnestics were disseminated through the air vents in an attempt to deescalate the rapidly out of control situation.

**Addendum 721-EX.2:** Updated Object Class

Two internal surveys of Site-19 staff were conducted by the Human Resources Department on [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6154 2/1/2025] and 14/2/2025 in order to find a cause for SCP-721-EX&#39;s effects. Agent O&#39;Hare was isolated during the latter survey in an undisclosed location.

The results of the survey concluded that SCP-721-EX is surprisingly non-existent. Instead, Agent O&#39;Hare simply maintains a high level of popularity among staff, especially from [https://twitter.com/jackrabbit_scp Foundation propaganda] posted around Site-19. Due to this popularity, Agent O&#39;Hare is a common conversation topic among Foundation staff communications, explaining the program&#39;s results. These results were consistent among both surveys, concluding that her popularity does not change with the holiday, and that most staff members believe they have an opportunity with Agent O&#39;Hare on Valentine&#39;s Day. It was discovered that the first incident had occurred due to a secondary cause of vodka infused chocolates that were given to the majority of staff as a gift for the holiday. This unintentionally caused several personnel to become intoxicated and behave more recklessly.

To prevent further disruptions to site security and efficacy, annual mandatory Anti-Harassment seminars and training are to be held for all Foundation staff the day before Valentine&#39;s Day. Psychological evaluations are to be given one month prior to assess personnel&#39;s behavior and likelihood in pursuing romantic relations with Agent O&#39;Hare. All Valentine&#39;s Day gifts given to staff by the Foundation are to be non-alcoholic. Foundation staff are to be reminded that Agent O&#39;Hare most likely has no interest in them in particular, unless otherwise stated.
