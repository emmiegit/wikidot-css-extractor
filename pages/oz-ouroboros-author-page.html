It is usually found in its cushion/bean-bag-filled room taking naps, or in the cafeteria/kitchen munching on ice cream and waffles.

Occasionally, it accompanies a Researcher on a trip for moral support, and for hopping around chasing butterflies and dandelions.  It can also serve as a mode of transportation by consuming large amounts of sweets and becoming a giant, squishy tank capable of firing candy missiles.

O.Z. is not, contrary to popular belief in Site-██, ooey, gooey, rich, and chewy, though it might be willing to share its candy stockpile with you if you are nice to it.  //(Except the mochi; that&#39;s all for it, and it alone)//

* [[[SCP-1762]]]: This was the first Skip I ever posted to the main site, and I must say I am extremely proud of how it turned out.  Though of course, if it involves origami, and it involves dragons, I&#39;m gonna like it, but I honestly do think this was a great first SCP.

* [[[SCP-2988]]]: I love the Pitch Haven series, so I really wanted to write something for it, and that&#39;s what I did here! Also, finally got to implement an old idea of disembodied hands/arms from a much older, unrelated draft.

* [[[SCP-2954]]]: I began with the hope that I would just have fun with this one, and in the end, I did indeed.  Some people might find this a bit nostalgic //(I know I drew a lot of inspiration from hours of watching old Showa era monster movies as a kid)//, others might not have a lot of connection.  I&#39;m fine either way; it was fun. :3

* [[[SCP-489]]]: An idea that spontaneously began to form after some brainstorming/screwing around in the chatroom, I took a silly idea about an exterminator with problems and turned it into 489.  It&#39;s goofy, it&#39;s oddly charming, and I got a Series 1 slot, so yay!

* [[[SCP-2902]]]:  Ah, Herman Fuller, you will always be my favorite GOI, and I&#39;m glad I was finally able to write a Skip contributing to your crew.  That&#39;s really all I have to say.

* [[[SCP-2905]]]: My second contribution to the Pitch Haven canon, 2905 introduced Izaak&#39;s student; writing a new character is always an enjoyable process for me, as I get to see them develop through my own ideas.

* [[[SCP-3001]]]: As my new favorite exclamation of surprise goes, Holy balls. What a wild ride. Ended up getting 2nd place in the 3000 Contest and my first ever SCP to reach triple hundreds. I am //immensely// proud of how well this turned out, and how well it was received by the community. Like, you peeps don&#39;t even know. I won&#39;t spoil it too much because you should read it, it&#39;s gud, but the inspiration came from my long-held fear of being left alone.

* [[[A Circus Milked Dry]]] 
* [[[A Circus of a Wreck]]]
* [[[A Circus With Paranoia]]]

All of my Circus Clowns Tales were fun to write, mainly because there are so many things you can do with shape-shifting Eldritch Clowns.  A big key point in these Tales came from [[[SCP-1921]]]. CLOWN MILK.

* [[[Free Freaks]]]

Another Circus Tale involving people of the freak show. I&#39;ll eventually write a sequel, but honestly having a bit of writer&#39;s block on how to proceed.
