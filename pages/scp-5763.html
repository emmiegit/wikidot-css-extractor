**Special Containment Procedures:** Observation towers are constructed within a 10 kilometer radius of SCP-5763. Non-Foundation individuals sighted approaching the area are to be intervened, under the cover story of a chemical spill in said area.

Research into the current whereabouts of the individuals present in SCP-5763-1’s journal are ongoing.

**Description:** SCP-5763 refers to a house currently engulfed in flames. The fire does not spread any further from the property and has thus far been unable to be extinguished. SCP-5763, though heavily damaged, is seemingly unaffected by the fire.

The interior of SCP-5763 is an extra-dimensional space. It is a single, tilted hallway with multiple doors, however, only the door located at the end of the hallway is functional. The others have resisted all attempts in opening. Furniture is also present, with many resting on the ceiling or the walls through anomalous means.

Inside the aforementioned room, sheets of paper are scattered across the floor, most of the wallpaper is torn off, and a figure //(Designated SCP-5763-1)// is in the middle, surrounded by multiple mannequins, crudely covered in makeup on their faces and wearing traditionally feminine clothing.

SCP-5763-1 is Timothy Pines, a 14-year-old male of Caucasian descent, measuring approximately 152cm in height and weighs roughly 36 kilograms. It stands in a permanent vegetative state and its average body temperature is -10 degrees Celsius.

**Discovery:** SCP-5763 was discovered when an undercover field agent impersonating a fireman was sent in to put out the reported fire. It was then given SCP status and all non-Foundation individuals involved were given amnestics.

During initial investigation of the anomaly, a hard-cover book, believed to be SCP-5763-1’s journal, was found in its arms, which was immediately confiscated. The full contents of said journal is located in Addendum 5763-A.

**Addendum 5763-A - Journal Entries:** The following is a series of journal entries recorded by SCP-5763-1.

Hello. So, my mom gave me this journal to write my thoughts down, the first in a long time she ever gave me anything. Anyways, my name is Timothy Pines. I am a freshman at my school, just moved in.

I guess you could say I&#39;m a pretty quiet kid, never had friends, not even the affection from my own two parents, always busy at work and such. I feel like they don&#39;t care at all. I mean, I&#39;m used to it at this point, used to every mishap.

Tomorrow will be the first day. I hope I get to make friends there. If not, oh well, I guess. Goodnight.

Alright, so the first day went and gone.  There was an assembly, speeches, the usual. Rest of the day, we introduced ourselves. It was embarrassing when it was my turn. I felt very nervous, sweaty. Everyone laughed at me. I think I&#39;m already the laughingstock of my class.

No one came to talk to me. I was sitting alone during recess. That convinced me to eat in the classroom from tomorrow onwards. It&#39;s better since the other students have somewhere to sit.

I wonder why this is happening to me. I am a good person, right? What did I do to deserve this?  Was it that one time I littered? If it is, then I&#39;m sorry. Just give me one day, one friend, some time to enjoy instead of waste.

God, I&#39;m so pitiful. I&#39;m gonna stop writing and go to sleep, so I can forget all of this. Let&#39;s hope the next day will be better, but I can already expect something worse is gonna happen.

Surprise, surprise, journal, I got bullied. Second day in too, what a record. Lunch money stolen, verbally assaulted, tripped, kicked, and threw my bag off a bridge. Maybe I should tell my parents. Oh wait, they&#39;re too busy ignoring me. It&#39;s odd how I&#39;m still under their roof when they don&#39;t bother to spend some time with me.

Why should I even care? As if they ever cherished, loved, or even acknowledged me. If they could, they would kick me out onto the streets, alone and in the heavy rain, where I belong at this point.

But wait, who cares? Who cares about my feelings? All I can do is write another journal entry to vent over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. All I can do is complain and whine. Boohoo, I&#39;m sad. Oh, fuck me. As if I&#39;m any special.

I&#39;m too tired to write any more. Goodbye.

Finally, it happened. I made a friend.

I was being disturbed during recess again. This jock fuck, Noah, came in and asked me for some cash again. That was when this girl named Amelia stepped in and confronted him. Amelia is the popular girl in school, along with two of her friends, Evelyn and Josie. Together, they&#39;re called &#34;The Flowerscouts.&#34; Very generic name if you asked me.

I always thought she was a mean person, especially since she has a high reputation and such, but she seemed pretty genuine back there. She even asked me if I was all good. That&#39;s how we got to know each other. Amelia even introduced me to her friends too. We quickly got along.

Looks like spring will come earlier than expected. Let&#39;s hope my life will turn a new leaf. This is the first time I can say I can&#39;t wait for school tomorrow. I guess this place isn&#39;t so terrible after all. I just have to be patient.

Anyways, it&#39;s getting late. I&#39;ll be heading off to sleep. Have a good night, journal.

Amelia gave me a friendship bracelet as a welcoming gift the other day. I love it. I&#39;m going to wear it every day now and treasure it.

This is so different from the norm for me. All I can do is get used to it.

I&#39;ve been invited to watch a movie this coming Saturday. I never went anywhere with anyone before. I&#39;ve always been alone, so I don&#39;t know much of the outside world. I never even owned a phone.

I would ask my parents if that&#39;ll be okay with them, but I doubt they even care, so might as well go without telling. It&#39;s fine. They&#39;ll just be at work for most of the day after all.

The movie was great, the food was delicious, everything was just right.

If my younger self could see me right now, socializing, they would be amazed. Hell, I&#39;m still processing the present. It&#39;s great to know that there are people out there who are willing to befriend me. Meeting up with people, going to places with them, gifting each other, all of it was such alien concepts to me before. Glad to know somebody like Amelia can keep me company.

My high school life is heading the right path and for the better. For the first time, I am willing to venture onwards. It&#39;s lovely.

Amelia and the others had a fight during recess. She accused Josie of stealing her &#34;expensive&#34; lipstick. Josie claimed she didn&#39;t, with Evelyn on her side. I tried to calm all of them down, but they ignored me, fixated on each other. Right now, they won&#39;t talk at all. I mean, I get it&#39;s pricey, but it&#39;s just lipstick.

I&#39;ll try to talk to them tomorrow and see if we can work things out. I don&#39;t want this friendship to end just as it was getting started.

------


[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

------


= **__Journal Entry 09__**

------


Yeah, it didn&#39;t work out.

I tried to gather them up during recess, and they fought again, bringing in a lot of students&#39; attention. Amelia still couldn&#39;t forgive Josie for what happened beforehand, ranting about her popularity and how &#34;they&#39;re nothing without her and to her.&#34; That was devastating to hear, especially since they&#39;ve been hand-in-hand best friends before I transferred here.

I feel like it&#39;s better to leave them alone for a while. I&#39;ll talk to everyone separately so it won&#39;t attract any more people. I just hope it all works out in the end.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

Amelia noticed me talking to Evelyn and Josie, saying that &#34;they&#39;re not my friends anymore&#34; and that &#34;she&#39;s the only person I can trust.&#34; It sounded so surreal coming from her. She&#39;s my friend, yes, but I don&#39;t know if she thinks the same. Does she think of me as her slave?

I decided to avoid her for the rest of the day, telling her to make up to her friends and that she is in the wrong. She looked very offended from what I&#39;ve said. I hope she got the message. Later on, I was processing her words, saying I don&#39;t deserve them, as if they&#39;ve wronged her. I mean, there was the lipstick incident, but I don&#39;t see it as a problem.

I&#39;m just going to sleep. I don&#39;t want to think about it.

------


[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

------


= **__Journal Entry 11__**

------


The next thing I knew, all three of them turned their back against me. They all ignored, avoided, pushed me away. What did I do? They kept going on with the charade until the end of our lessons.

With this, I&#39;m convinced that something must&#39;ve happened. Tomorrow, I will confront them.

------


[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

------


= **__Journal Entry 12__**

------


So, I did it.

Apparently, Amelia managed to convince the others that I was the one who separated the group, that I was the one who stole her lipstick without notice. Then, she brought up a private chat between &#39;me&#39; and her, &#39;confessing what I did.&#39; I told them that I didn&#39;t own a phone, but they couldn&#39;t believe me, saying &#34;what kid doesn&#39;t own a phone,&#34; as if they know anything.

And just like that, they all left me. Amelia betrayed me and lied to her own friends. They bullied me for the rest of the day. Made fun of me, spilt my food, and I saw the joyfulness in Amelia&#39;s eyes throughout. They even threw my bag out the window without me noticing.

I just can&#39;t comprehend this. Why did this happen to me? What did I do?

------


[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

------


= **__Journal Entry 13__**

------


I decided to stay home today. I just can&#39;t bear that this is present times.

I threw away the bracelet Amelia gave me in the trash as a welcoming gift for my loneliness. It&#39;s no treasure anymore. It&#39;s fools gold. I guess it&#39;s back to this being the norm.

//I guess all I&#39;m good at is keeping quiet. I guess it&#39;s better to be alone. I guess I need some time apart from everyone. I guess life will never change. I guess it&#39;s inevitable. I guess it&#39;s alright like this. I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m okay. I&#39;m not lying whatsoever, so leave me be.//
