//(A burst of white noise obscures all other sounds for 2 seconds)//

**Unknown Voice #1:** ...Chao was able to confirm that their Bookburners are incapable of multiverse travel. Still, we should do our due diligence--

**Unknown Voice #2:** Oh, //(unintelligible)//...

**Unknown Voice #1:** What? //(Shuffling)// ...Huh.

**VNP-507:** //(laughs)// &#34;&#39;Huh&#39;&#34;? That&#39;s all you have to say to meeting yourself?

**Unknown Voice #1:** Well, you&#39;re not the first version of myself I&#39;ve met--

**Unknown Voice #2:** //(sighs)// Gods, please. If you two are going to talk, do it somewhere that isn&#39;t my office.

**Unknown Voice #1:** Silvia--

**Silvia:** No, Hopper. I can stand only one of you at a time, so please...go.

**Hopper:** ...Alright. Come on, you.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
//(The scraping of chairs against wood)//

**VNP-507:** So, you&#39;re called Hopper here. //(laughs)// I guess subtlety with names is a virtue the Hand lacks across all universes.

**Hopper:** Look, it was the new name L.S. christened me with, after they saved me from that wretched place in Maycord. It fits me, and my job, well. I don&#39;t hate our old name; it just doesn&#39;t mean anything to me anymore. And what about //you//? You&#39;re in plainclothes, so I assume the Jailors never sunk their claws into you, either?

**VNP-507:** ...Not...exactly. Unofficially, everyone calls me Thomas Yaltz, but on the paperwork, I am &#34;VNP-507&#34;.

**Hopper:** //(Sighs; next words are muttered)// Gods above. //(Normal volume)// Alright, explain.
[[/div]]
-----
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Hopper:** ...Alright, so let just me see if I&#39;m understanding everything correctly.

**VNP-507:** Okay, sure.

**Hopper:** Your branch of Yggdrasil is borne from an event called the Impasse-which for the record has **not** been mentioned in any capacity within any of the other universes I&#39;ve traveled to, so I really have to strongly question the claim of it being an inevitability across the whole multiverse. And your version of the Jailors chose to own up to being responsible for the weakening of magic, break the Masquerade, and start &#39;normalizing&#39; the Veil with the Mundane to bring it back.

**VNP-507:** You left some things out, but...yes, essentially.

**Hopper:** Right, of course. And your universe is part of some larger &#34;meta-branch&#34; formed from the assimilation and entangling of at least eight or nine other branches into it.

**VNP-507:** From what I&#39;ve been able to glean from other versions of myself and the Black Queens, yes.

**Hopper:** That is an affront to--!

**VNP-507:** //(interrupting)// Oh, don&#39;t **you** give me the &#34;affront to the multiverse&#34; spiel! Our entire **existence** across all of &#34;Yggdrasil&#34; is an &#34;affront&#34; to it, if you want to go down that road. Isn&#39;t it a little hypocritical, for a member of the Hand, to call things heretical?

//(Hopper is silent)//

**VNP-507:** //(sighs)// Look, I get it, really. The circumstances of my branch&#39;s creation seem a little strange to me, too. The fact that we have not found **any** splintering sub-branches that diverge from each other, or from the Impasse, seems especially concerning. But, it&#39;s above my level of expertise and pay for me to worry about these things, and regardless of the circumstances, I&#39;m not going to let you, or any other me, disparage my home.

//(Ten seconds of silence pass, before there is the sound of a throat being cleared)//

**Hopper:** ...Yes, you&#39;re right. I&#39;m sorry. I let my own biases cloud my judgment, and that&#39;s not fair to you or productive for this discussion.

**VNP-507:** //(laughs)// Apology accepted.

**Hopper:** //(Claps hands together twice)// Okay, why don&#39;t we unwind a little with some drinks? Our winery was completely untouched by the Bookburners&#39; scorching, and there&#39;s an excellent bottle of 18th century Algaddan chardonnay that&#39;s just right for this occasion...

**VNP-507:** --Alex Thorley?

**Hopper:** Yeah, I&#39;ve met a few of them. Nice person, though they tend to blur together throughout the universes. Doctor Spanko?

**VNP-507:** Surprisingly erudite, once you spend some time around them. Their theory on //(unintelligible)// was an eye-opener.

**Hopper:** I was never able to stay by them long enough to pick up the details, before I //(unintelligible)// back here.

//(Sounds of wine glasses placed against a table)//

**VNP-507:** //(Unintelligible)//, let&#39;s compare the worlds we&#39;ve &#39;hopped&#39; to then. You been to that universe where [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7216 that poor woman made of smog] ended up causing //(unintelligible)// Korea?

**Hopper:** Yeah. It was one of the first worlds I went after joining the Hand. Gathered a [[[broken-masquerade-epistolary|pretty extensive dossier]]] of info from there, with a lot of sources. Helped Silvia really trust me.

**VNP-507:** ...Did you run into the version of us from there?

**Hopper:** //(Sighs)// No, not in person. From what I&#39;ve heard, they&#39;re a reality television star; got their own show on the Travel Channel and everything.

**VNP-507:** Christ. ... //(Unintelligible)// ever end up in that void with nothing but a toll booth?

//(Hopper laughs uproariously)//

**VNP-507:** Is...that a yes?

**Hopper:** Yeah. Yeah, I ended up there, once. //(Unintelligible)// with a hat told me I couldn&#39;t go past, because I didn&#39;t //(unintelligible)// standards.

**VNP-507:** That tracks. Wonder what the big deal was.

**Hopper:** Don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever know, unfortunately.

//(Hopper goes silent)//

**VNP-507:** //(worried)//...Hey, what&#39;s wrong?

**Hopper:** [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/items-purchases-and-other-oddities-gathered-by-agent-hopper ...Did you ever end up in that world], [[[scp-5000|where the jailors went insane, and started]]] //(unintelligible)//...

//(VNP-507 is silent for five seconds. A breath from Hopper, presumably from physical contact initiated by VNP-507)//

**VNP-507:** ...Yes. You&#39;re worried, deep down, that they were right, aren&#39;t you?

//(There is no verbal response from Hopper, though it is presumed that they&#39;ve nodded)//

**VNP-507:** The multiverse&#39;s a frightening place, Hopper. We know that more than anyone. But it is not that **nihilistic**. Trust me, I looked and spoke with //(unintelligible)// of people more knowledgeable about this than I am, and as far as they can tell, it is only true for one **very** distant &#34;branch&#34; of &#34;Yggdrasil&#34;. Humanity, as a whole, are not sociopathic pawns of //(unintelligible)//

//(There is still no verbal response from Hopper; only a small sniffle)//

**VNP-507:** Let&#39;s change the subject.

**Hopper:** ...Yes, let&#39;s.

**VNP-507:** And refill our glasses.

**Hopper:** //(Laughs)// Yes, let&#39;s!

**VNP-507:** Speaking of universes, have you ever been to any that have &#34;crossed//(unintelligible)//&#34;?

**Hopper:** I have been to a few worlds where the branches of Ygdrassil have //(unintelligible)// merged with one another, yes. Though not to the extreme of your home universe&#39;s.

**VNP-507:** Right. But I&#39;m talkin&#39; about ones that have //(unintelligible)// **over**. As in with other fic//(unintelligible)//.

//(A glass is forcefully set down. Hopper&#39;s next words lack any signs of intoxication)//

&gt; [[size 125%]]Transcriber&#39;s note: Audio temporarily drops after this point, and we&#39;re presuming it to be a brief malfunction in VNP-507&#39;s recording device. The cause is still under investigation.[[/size]]

//(Glass shatters. Muffled sounds are coming from VNP-507; it is presumed Hopper covered their mouth with their hand)//

**Hopper:** //(Shouting) DON&#39;T. EVER. DO THAT. AGAIN.// Am I clear?

//(VNP-507 makes another muffled sound, and then coughs as their mouth is unobstructed)//

**VNP-507:** Crystal, crystal! What the fuck was that--?

**Hopper:** Shh!

//(Both Hopper and VNP-507 are silent for twenty seconds, before Hopper resumes speaking)//

**Hopper:** You gave me one lesson about the multiverse, so let me return the favor. There are //beings// out there, that live in the Garden where all World Trees reside, that do not like their Branches rubbing against one another. And these beings are very, //very// thorough with their Pruning, if they catch any wind about it. You would be wise not to anger them by drawing attention on yourself.

**VNP-507:** Right...okay, lesson learned. //(groans)// I made you ruin such a priceless bottle, just to save our asses--

**Hopper:** //(Voice softening)// Don&#39;t trouble yourself about it. The winery&#39;s well-stocked with almost a hundred more just like it. //(Sighs)// Although, we should try and clean this mess up, so L.S. does not have to have a poor Scribe do it instead.

**VNP-507:** ...Yeah, you&#39;re right...

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**VNP-507:** I can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t noticed until now, but I haven&#39;t heard the songs of the Rounderpede the whole time I&#39;ve been here.

**Hopper:** //(Sighs)// Yes, unfortunately, [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/what-are-we-to-a-genius-loci-if-not-aliens that magnificent creature was among many of the casualties of the Bookburner&#39;s razing.]

**VNP-507:** That&#39;s horrible. ...Why //did// they do all that they did, in this world?

**Hopper:** I can&#39;t even begin to fathom. It was before my time. Before the Hand really settled in the Library and xer halls. Disgust with the place&#39;s abnormality in their eyes, a safe bet. Regardless of their reasoning, it&#39;s because of them that we have no Ways, and how we&#39;re cut off from the rest of Yggdrasil&#39;s branches...

**VNP-507:** Except for you.

**Hopper:** ...Except for us, yeah.

**VNP-507:** //(Sighs)// Sometimes, I forget that, despite all of the beautiful worlds I&#39;ve seen, all the wonderful people I met, and the work that I do with it...this part of us is a burden, in the end. We can never really have truly &#34;normal&#34; lives, except in small, two week bursts.

**Hopper:** That&#39;s true. But we can use it to make the most of our purposes in life. For me, that&#39;s helping to refill the Library&#39;s wealth of knowledge, healing the wounds the Bookburners scarred xem with. And for you, that&#39;s...

//(Hopper pauses)//

**Hopper:** You know, you never did tell me what you do, as part of Vanguard&#39;s &#34;normalization&#34;.

**VNP-507:** //(Laughs)// Almost the same thing, but on a wider scale. Sharing the knowledge I gather from these worlds with the scientific community--

//(There is a brief burst of white noise)//

**VNP-507:** Shit! I thought I&#39;d have more time. I&#39;m sorry, Hopper, but I guess that&#39;s going to be it for now.

**Hopper:** It&#39;s part of the job...It was nice to meet you, Thomas Yaltz. May we meet again, someday, somewhere.

//(If VNP-507 replies, it is unheard due to the white noise distorting all further audio, until they return home)//
