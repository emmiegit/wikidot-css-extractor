//**PLEASE NOTE:** Only the anomalous moments recorded by Security Camera #██████ have been transcribed into text. The times of the specific incidents have been noted.//

**02/21/20██: 3:12 AM**

&gt; One of the double doors separating Foundation Relaxation Annex #4435 (FRA4435) from the corridor, originally closed, opens approximately 10 degrees. After three minutes, the door closes.

**02/25/20██: 12:25 PM**

&gt; Doctor █████████ is seen, through the doors, attempting to sit down on a chair within line-of-sight of the camera. The chair moves a foot behind him. Doctor █████████ lands on the floor. As █████████ gets up, with the assistance of other off-duty staff, laughing and cajoling is heard about █████████&#39;s alcohol consumption.

**02/28/20██: 7:23 PM**

&gt; Agent █████ is seen in the hallway outside of FRA4435 doing wall flips. █████ is muttering and cursing to himself. During his third jump, █████&#39;s right foot appears to become stationary at is highest point for half a second, before the agent is dropped downward with force. █████ does not seem to notice this, and treats the event as if he simply failed to make a full rotation.

**03/02/20██: 2:43 PM**

&gt; The doors to FRA4435 are open. A small object (later identified as a ping-pong ball) rolls into frame, out of the Annex. When the ball reaches the midpoint of the hallway, it abruptly stops. After a brief moment, the ball slowly rolls back against the wall the camera is facing. Agent ████ walks into frame, presumed to be looking for the ball. Upon discovery of the ball, ████ attempts to recover it. He struggles for three pulls, as if the ball had impossible weight, before falling backwards with the ball. Tossing the ball in his hand, ████ walks back into the Annex.

**03/02/20██: 4:02 PM**

&gt; Technician ███████&#39;s face is in frame, moving the camera to a view directly looking into FRA4435. ███████&#39;s face goes from boredom to annoyance, demanding that whoever is bumping the ladder to stop, lest he punish them physically. 4 seconds later, ███████&#39;s face drops out of frame. No longer supported by its mechanical supports, the camera points downward, showing ███████&#39;s body. His head is bent at an odd angle.

**03/02/20██: 4:55 PM**

&gt; Technician ████ is seen placing a standard &#34;Investigation In Progress, Do Not Use&#34; sticker on the door to FRA4435. After ████ walks away, the sticker falls off, landing in six pieces.

**03/03/20██: 2:12 AM**

&gt; The lights in FRA4435, formerly off, turn on for two minutes, then turn off again. Ten minutes later, the glass of one of the doors shatters outwards. Examination reveals that a bolt on one of the athletic machines failed catastrophically,  flinging a 18kg weight through the door.

**03/03/20██: 10 AM**
//Non-anomalous recording// 

&gt; FRA4435 is cordoned off. A thick plastic tarp blocks sight, but light from within shows multiple persons, walking around. The sounds heard of those inside performing a standard security examination.

**03/03/20██: 11:01 PM**

&gt; Researcher ████ is the last of a group of █ Researchers leaving the cordoned-off FRA4435. ████ calls to the rest, informing them that he left something inside. ████ returns inside, turning on a light. ████&#39;s silhouette can be seen rummaging around. At 11:05 PM, ████ stands up straight. He does not move for █ hours, after which he walks out inconspicuously. He is met by three armed guards.

**03/05/20██: 1 PM**

&gt; Doctors ███ and ██████ are standing in front of the door to FRA4435, arguing about the lack of progress in solving the issues involving FRA4435. Doctor ███ believes that the Foundation knows which specific item inside FRA4435 is anomalous, and that the Foundation is sacrificing valuable staff to test it, instead of &#34;throwing Ds at it like they should&#34;. Doctor ██████ disagrees, pointing out that all reports show inconclusive results, meaning that as far as the Foundation is aware, there is nothing anomalous about anything inside FRA4435.
&gt; 
&gt; Both of them turn to face the camera in unison.
