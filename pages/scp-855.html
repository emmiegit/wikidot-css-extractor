**Item #:** SCP-855

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Four (4) members of security are to be present outside SCP-855&#39;s location at all times. No staff are to enter SCP-855 during &#34;Horror&#34;, &#34;Surreal&#34;, &#34;Action&#34;, &#34;Science Fiction&#34; or &#34;Disaster&#34; phases. Any entities attempting to leave SCP-855 during the &#34;Horror&#34; phase are to be dispatched by security staff. 

Any personnel entering SCP-855 during its &#34;Western&#34; phase are to be monitored by security staff for signs of aggression. During all other phases, research staff are free to enter and monitor SCP-855.

**Description:** SCP-855 is the designation given to Lecture Hall ██, located at Site ██. SCP-855 is equipped to seat one hundred (100) personnel. One reinforced skylight is present on the ceiling to allow the entry of natural light.

Each month, SCP-855 will redecorate itself and temporarily develop anomalous properties, seemingly themed after genres of film. This continues for the entirety of the month, and has taken the form of:

* Manifestation of entities
* Mind-altering Effects
* Hallucinations

**Genre Log:**


||~ Month ||~ Presumed &#39;Genre&#39; ||~ Effects ||
|| January || Action || Reports of explosions came from within SCP-855. Security was called in to investigate, at which point a sports car burst through the doors into SCP-855, running over one (1) member of security. Personnel later reported a man in a tuxedo firing at them with a pistol from within the vehicle. Vehicle vanished thirty (30) seconds later.||
|| February || Detective Noir || Researchers within SCP-855 temporarily adopted a pessimistic attitude. Light spectrum appears to be affected, causing all researchers in SCP-855 to turn monochrome.||
|| March || Surreal || All researchers sent into SCP-855 disappeared without a trace. Mobile Task Force Beta-23 (&#34;Film Critics&#34;) was sent in for a retrieval mission. One member of Mobile Task Force Beta-23 was recovered twenty (20) days after entry, the rest were declared KIA. Survivor claims that SCP-855 contained a room that stretched on for miles, with &#39;things&#39; in it. Survivor did not respond to further inquiry regarding the nature of said entities. ||
|| April || Comedy || Rate of research accidents surrounding SCP-855 increased by 50%. Multiple personnel reported disembodied laughter. ||
|| May || Western || Increased aggression noted in personnel inside SCP-855. Multiple fights break out. After researchers were evacuated, the doors leading into SCP-855 opened independently, at which point a single tumbleweed emerged. ||
|| June || Disaster || All personnel evacuated from SCP-855. Analysis of SCP-855 via camera drone shows dangerously high levels of radiation. Large, ratlike creature detected by camera drone. ||
|| July || Gangster || Footage camera drone used to monitor SCP-855 showed a large city similar to 1950&#39;s Chicago. Every individual on the street appeared to be dressed in the manner of a stereotypical gangster.||
|| August || Drama || Upon entering SCP-855, researchers became highly aggressive and began insulting and arguing with those nearby. ||
|| September || Science Fiction || Entry to SCP-855 was strictly forbidden, as sensors indicated no oxygen was present within. ||
|| October || War || Sounds of conflict were audible from within SCP-855. Security were called in to prevent a repeat of the &#34;Action&#34; incident. A World War 2 era tank subsequently emerged from SCP-855 and fired upon security, killing three (3) of them. Said tank vanished thirty (30) seconds later. ||
|| November || Historical || Recording from camera drone sent into SCP-855 showed a portrayal of Rome at the height of the Roman Empire. Further analysis revealed several historical inaccuracies, as all individuals were observed to speak clear English, some with obvious accents.||
|| December || Horror || A heavy-set man with a noose around his neck emerged from within SCP-855, wielding a large knife. ██ personnel killed during partial containment breach. Security later reported that bullets had little effect on the entity. ||
