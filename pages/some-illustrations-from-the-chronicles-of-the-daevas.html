//The Chronicles of the Daevas// is a manuscript containing the recorded history of the Daevite Empire from its inception in 11000 BC to its destruction by the Fuladhi Army (Mekhanites) around 5500 BC. The chronicles were recorded by several authors, in the language Daevic Barhon. It contains six thousand pages.
 
The original manuscript has six copies, with the first found in the ruins of Rakhigarhi in the year 1970. The rest were found around the globe, with the latest found in Spain, with claims that the book originally belonged to a Spanish noble who bought it from a Mexican treasure hunter who in turn found it at a Mayan ruin around 1820. The book is written in a script, seemingly an ancestor of the Indus script, and thus became a Rosetta stone for archaeologists, strengthening the theory that the Indus Valley civilization was a successor state of the Daevic Empire. However, later analysis showed that both spoke a very different language, and IVC seemingly just took the Daevic script and modified it according to their needs.

The Book 3 was found at the ruins of Old Adytum, Manchuria, in 1889, also called the Manchurian manuscript, by a Nalkan, Amur Xi, and was kept at the New Adytum library for a hundred and one years before being handed over to the Nine Shields.
 
The Manchurian Manuscript is a bilingual text; each Daevic line is followed by a Nalkan translation, and it contains illustrations with captions containing context. This makes the manuscript have an additional two thousand pages.
 
Here are some of those illustrations:

Armed with a blade and a ray-bow, these were the most formidable warriors on this Earth. No spirit beast, a Sarcik abomination, or even the astras of the Northerners could harm them.

|caption=The Mekhanites, or, as they were known, Falud, originally lived on the triangular peninsula between Devon and Fi. They were a race of barbaric, charcoal-skinned nomads who would periodically raid and pillage the Irbain people, who inhabited the much larger peninsula of Yarkush. Till the day when Devon nearly exterminated them on the eve of our war with Sarciks, the demon Mekhane fell from the heavens and made a covenant with a single Faludi boy, Arin, and his wife, Minka, and thus was born Amoni Ram, an insect-like city. Arin Mai became the first Bumaro, and with his people and the newly founded demon and its city, he attacked Daevon during our war with Irbain. We were pushed back from Yarkush while Amoni Ram enslaved Irbain. Rajmata Sirbhanmini sent her best men and mages to destroy this new threat. With great struggle, we pushed Amoni Ram into the cursed desert of Fi and built a great wall over their former homeland to keep them out of Daevon. For a thousand years, there was peace until the wall was torn open by Amoni Ram, who, now having given birth to two more, smaller crawling cities and absorbed much of the denizens of Fi, attacked Daevon again. The time of ending began.

The Bumaro is not the fleshy body that gives direction to the city; the Bumaro is the soul of the city, sitting next to the demon. Hamish&#39;s soul inhabited the city and its war machines, guiding every Mekhanite, commanding every Khiraz, and holding god-like powers while his mortal body was taken care of by priests. Due to the nature of this transfiguration, the oldest child becomes the heir while the younger sibling produces a new one.

As our western half burned to cinders, the cursed city of Amoni Ram started crawling towards Mamjul. What remained of our army at the west fell back to the scarlet city while men were summoned from the East. In this bleak time, help came from the place we never even expected: Grand Karcist Iun arrived with his army of well-trained men and abominations, hardened by war with tribes in the frozen wastelands of the Baikal. The Sarciks came to our aid, not because they harboured any likeness for us, but because of the threat of Amoni Ram. They arrived not to save Mamjul, but to save Adytum. On the eve of the siege, Rajmata Vaslirasirraj-Shirat and Iun rode on a flying abomination, looking at the city of Amoni Ram before the war.
