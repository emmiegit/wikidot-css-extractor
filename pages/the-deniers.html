**Conspectus**
[[/=]]

A loosely structured organization which seeks to destroy what they don&#39;t understand via organized acts of violence. The Deniers oppose all faithful adherents,[[footnote]] No kidding. Dharmic, Mekhanite, Fifthist, Raëlist, Ortothan, Abrahamic, Scientologist, Wiccan... I could go on. ~ Lavender[[/footnote]] practitioners of thaumaturgy and students of the occult.[[footnote]] Basically, they&#39;re like that shitty fake story about those shitty shitheads Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold going around asking people if they believe in G-d before shooting them, except somehow shittier. ~ Esther[[/footnote]] Members of the Deniers hold a strong, unwavering belief in what they call facts and reason, though as one may already suspect, they know nothing of the truths of this world.

So long as they pose a threat to these halls, their ilk is not welcome here.[[footnote]] Don&#39;t you think that maybe if we let them in they would see how it&#39;s all real and all makes sense and maybe they would stop being huge dicks? ~ Cycloid [[/footnote]][[footnote]] And risk being attacked in our own home? No. ~ Lavender [[/footnote]]

**Knowledge**
[[/=]]

**Traits:** Deniers are easily identifiable by their cowardice, hypocrisy, and pseudointellectual babble[[footnote]]They&#39;re also paskudnyaks, zhlobs, and cucks. ~Esther[[/footnote]]. Note that though not all individuals who exhibit these traits are Deniers, they are equally as pleasant. [[footnote]] One must additionally keep in mind, not all disbelievers of deities and magiks are Deniers, but may just be unaware. It is your duty as a scholar of the Library to educate them should they express an interest. ~Lavender [[/footnote]] Additionally, Deniers employ violence, extortion, blackmail, and threats to achieve their goals.

**Nature:** There is reason the Deniers are banned from the Library. Their malicious intent and desire to pervert the supernatural to fit within their narrow views are vile, as is the torture they subject believers and thaumaturges alike. 

**History &amp; Associated Parties:** The Deniers came to be following the end of the 4th Occult War.  Through the might of the Book Burners,[[footnote]] Of course, they&#39;re related to the Gun Fuckers. ~ Esther.[[/footnote]] the Deniers rose to provenance. Though in recent years their paths have diverged, the Deniers have kept the knowledge they gained from the Book Burners. The Deniers have chosen to go their own way following the inclusion of groups such as the Islamic Artifact Reclamation Directorate and the Sons of Shammai into the United Nations Occult Council[[footnote]] You know, for a group of people dedicated to &#39;challenging&#39; other&#39;s views, they don&#39;t seem to like having their own views be challenged. ~ Esther [[/footnote]].
 
Their history is long and varied, having orchestrated various attacks on faithful and thaumaturgists alike. Below is a brief collection of recent attacks orchestrated by the Deniers.
 
- 2017, Baghdad - ORIA HQ - Bombing, 12 dead, 26 injured.
- 2017, Portlands - Deer College - Kidnapping (3 counts).
- 2016, Soho - Attempted breach of a Way, No deaths/injuries.
- 2015, Paris - Fifth Church of the Stars, ???????[[footnote]] What happened here? ~ Cycloid [[/footnote]][[footnote]] We don&#39;t know for sure. Something about the number five. ~ Lavender [[/footnote]]
- 2015, Montpellier - Attempted breach of a Way, 3 dead, 2 injured.
- 2015, Khanty-Mansiysk - Proto Sarkic Settlement. 29 dead. No survivors.[[footnote]] Fuck. ~ Esther [[/footnote]]

**Approach:** Approaching the Deniers is ill-advised.[[footnote]] If these guys are so into logic like has been stated, then why can&#39;t we just try to reason with them? ~ Cycloid [[/footnote]][[footnote]] 
Maybe if they weren&#39;t fascists, Cycloid. But it&#39;s like drawing blood from a stone with them. ~Esther [[/footnote]] Though they are not as dangerous as the Book Burners or the Jailors, they are just as vicious and hellbent on destroying that which challenges their so-called &#39;truths.&#39; If faced with a group of Deniers, it is recommended one hides any visible connections to their faith or the supernatural if possible. Place your safety above all else and attempt to escape.

**Observations &amp; Stories**
[[/=]]

//&#34;The Cogwork Orthodox Church continue to resist a disturbing rise in this group&#39;s cowardly attempts on the blessed artifacts of MEKHANE and the lives of Her faithful. Despite the ongoing success of the Militants-Faithful in the defense of the Cathedral of Industry from direct force, a fleshly [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3859 parasite] capable of defiling Standardized components remains a known and active vector of attack, also confirmed to have compromised the faithful of the Maxwellist sect. We pray, together with all others afflicted, to expedite the demise of this particularly violent strain of heresy.&#34;//
- Saint-Legate Trunnion[[footnote]]Also, one of these fuckers called me a girl. ~Cycloid[[/footnote]]

//&#34;The Deniers have a long and varied history of terrorizing civilians at their places of worship. Thus I have heard; a reverend recently done speaking with his flock was captured and beaten senselessly for his devotion to his Lord. Repeatedly he was asked why his Lord would not save him from this fate. Though it pleases me to say the reverend has since recovered and continues his services, the criminals have yet to receive their karmic comeuppance.&#34;//

**Doubt**[[footnote]] How ironic! Doubting the doubters? Ha! ~ Lavender [[/footnote]][[footnote]] Trust me, there&#39;s no doubt these guys suck. ~ Esther [[/footnote]]
[[/=]]

Though claiming their membership includes many prolific thinkers and fellow disbelievers, there is reason to doubt these claims. Many, if not most disbelievers, disagree with their acts of violence and terrorism against the faithful, including their supposed high-profile members. Perhaps this is due to their lack of organizational structure, but this scholar believes it to be, what is referred to in the Library, &#39;a dick move.&#39;[[footnote]] Are you guys sure you don&#39;t know what Rick and Morty is? ~ Esther [[/footnote]]
----
Several accounts claim to cast light on this group&#39;s obscure sources of funding, with connections made between wealthy Neo-[http://www.scp-wiki.net/sarkicism-hub Nälkä] families and their few known benefactors. Attributed to this connection is a recent wave of attacks on Proto-Nälkä communities; the Deniers potentially used without their knowledge as a weapon against those Neo-Nälkä consider undesirable. However, these accounts are not verifiable - just as likely, violence against Proto-Nälkä communities simply forms part of a worrying trend of the Deniers&#39; increasing confidence in attacking even non-mundane religious groups.
