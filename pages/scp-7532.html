    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-7532

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Removing mentions of SCP-7532 online is of most prominence. Webcrawler-7581 is actuated to scan for references of SCP-7532 on discussion websites and report them to Foundation agents operating within moderation of social networks for purging. The item is stored at Site-██&#39;s research facility in object&#39;s compartment.

**Description:** Origination of the device remains unknown. It was found inside of an abandoned barn at Daryl, Saturnburg, along with its deceased owner&#39;s corpse. SCP-7532 essence has no relation to this area. The owner of the barn is thought to have purchased SCP-7532 from internet advertisements.

SCP-7532 is a treen box with metallic burnished borders, ornamental emblems[[footnote]] One of these decorative symbols is present on SCP-████. [[/footnote]] and a lever on its side. It by all definable appearances is a musical box. If anyone were to hold the item and scroll the lever, a song will begin to radiate from the device in a random pattern. After this has been operated for around half a minute, the box will open upward and a spinning ballerina is in the middle of the enclosure.

Upon having executed this, the holder&#39;s hands will become adhesive to the box until their bodily structure splits opened in the same modus operandi as the item itself. Their face being the first to cleave and spin in opposite directions per part. This after a minute will cease all of the apparition 

Forums dedicated to low calibre graphical blurbs have mentioned the item being advertised online. No copies of SCP-7532 are known to exist. There has to date not been any screenshots providing substantiation for their existence however posts refer to them with these motifs:

# Blurb being in 4:3 dimensions, suggesting that they might appear on the sides of the websites.
# Item selling for $240.
# Usage of the Comic Sans font.
# Picture of SCP-7532 presented.</textarea></pre>
