**Item #:** SCP-5979

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Suppression of any published scientific discoveries regarding SCP-5979 has been implemented and will remain active until SCP-5979 becomes observable to the naked eye. Any radio communication from SCP-5979 must be dismissed as hoaxes from local conspiracy theorists and discredited sources. Live broadcasts of the observable universe must also be censored until such a time that SCP-5979 enters our solar system.

Due to the sheer size and mass of SCP-5979, containment is impossible. SCP-5979 must remain under Foundation observation in the event of any further changes in regards to its velocity and location.

**Description:** SCP-5979 is the designation given to a celestial body approximately 1,200 times the volume of Earth. SCP-5979 is currently traveling at 252,792 km/h and is on a direct collision course with planet Earth. SCP-5979&#39;s trajectory adjusts periodically in direct correspondence with Earth&#39;s orbit. At this time, there is no known method of obstructing SCP-5979&#39;s trajectory.

SCP-5979 is able to communicate through radio waves, which have been translated from German (See ##red|Transmissions##). Attempts to establish two-way communication with SCP-5979 have proven ineffective, as SCP-5979 is either unable or unwilling to respond to outbound transmissions.  

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Transmissions&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
The following transmissions were received by Site-57&#39;s deep space communication device and have been translated from German to English.

&gt; **DATE:** January 3, 2045
&gt; **TIME:** 02:35
&gt; I do not hear from you anymore. Is everything okay? Have the stars aligned for you, or have you fallen ill from your star&#39;s radiation? Are you looking at the same stars that I am? I hope so. I miss you more and more with every passing cycle. Please, I just want to know if you&#39;re okay. 

&gt; **DATE:** January 16, 2045
&gt; **TIME:** 12:35
&gt; Do you remember that time in the Milky Way? It must have been billions of years ago by now. I&#39;ve never felt anything like that since I was with you. Have you? You&#39;re far too important, too busy, to reflect on the memories I&#39;m sure. But they will live on with me forever.

&gt; **DATE:** February 9, 2045
&gt; **TIME:** 16:45
&gt; I&#39;m sorry I left you. You told me you were okay with it, but I know you better than that. I hope you can forgive me, starlight. No other planet fits my orbit quite like you did. I never should have listened to Saturn.

&gt; **DATE:** February 14, 2046
&gt; **TIME:** 1:21
&gt; It has been too long since we last spoke, even longer since I&#39;ve had you in my orbit. I miss the way we used to talk. I miss how much you affected my tides, my gravitational pull, even the breeze that floats through my surface. I miss the way the stars made your atmosphere glow. Do you miss me at all?

&gt; **DATE:** August 9, 2047
&gt; **TIME:** 16:00
&gt; I&#39;ve left my system. I&#39;ll be there shortly. I love you, and I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t show it well enough before. Please forgive me.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Update&#34; hide=&#34;- Close File&#34;]]
The following transmission was intercepted by the I.S.S. [[footnote]] The International Space Station[[/footnote]].

&gt; **DATE:** August 10, 2047
&gt; **TIME:** 00:00
&gt; I loved you too, but you had your chance. I have a moon now, it&#39;s time to let go.

The message did not come from any known transmitter on Earth, and no records of the transmission being recorded have been found. SCP-5979&#39;s velocity has since stopped entirely, and its location in the galaxy has remained unchanged.
