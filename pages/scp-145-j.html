**Item #:** SCP-145-J

**Object Class:** Safe. It should be neutralized, but the Site Director&#39;s too goddamn cheap to buy a new one.

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to &#34;budget cuts&#34;, SCP-145-J is housed in Site-16&#39;s main staff kitchen, and is available for general use.  It isn&#39;t recommended, though.  A pair of oven-safe mitts have been provided to assist in SCP-145-J&#39;s operation.

Injuries sustained during SCP-145-J&#39;s use should be treated with aloe vera cream and a stern talking-to by Site-16 Lead RN █████ Clemens for thinking you could handle a hot plate with your bare hands, you brain-dead idiot.  To date, SCP-145-J has resulted in 141 cases of first-degree burns, including 63 D-Class, 56 junior and senior researchers, 21 MTF agents, and one O-5.  I call that one 0-5 now.

**Description:** SCP-145-J is an SHARP-brand 1000W/R-21LC commercial microwave whose use can cause one of several anomalous effects on what is placed inside of it:

* It doesn&#39;t heat anything.
* It burns everything.
* The edges get roasted but the center is still frozen.
* The whole damn thing is ice cold but the plate it&#39;s on is molten lava hot.
* Smoke.  Lots of smoke.
* The tray doesn&#39;t spin.
* --The tray alternates between spinning clockwise and counterclockwise-- it&#39;s supposed to do that, never mind.

At present, all requests to disassemble SCP-145-J in the hopes of finding the source of its anomaly are uniformly denied, because if it doesn&#39;t work afterwards, then we don&#39;t have //anything//, and that&#39;s worse than trying to work with this crap.  Sometimes I want to bring in a hot meal and not go out to eat.  Have you //seen// how expensive the places around town are now?  Did we really need to have this facility near a major metropolitan area?  Property taxes must be through the roof, that&#39;s probably the reasoning behind why we can&#39;t afford a replacement.

Attempts to heat food without a plate have been approved, but that&#39;s pretty unsanitary and it looks gross in there.  During a yearly audit of security procedures at Site-16, including a review of old security footage, it was discovered Agent ██████ used SCP-145-J to heat up a Hot Pocket without putting a plate under it and it exploded.  He didn&#39;t even clean up afterwards, he just left like he thought no one was watching.  Grounds for disciplinary action, right?  That&#39;s what I thought, too, but fuck, he&#39;s still here.  We&#39;ve incinerated D-Class for less, just because he has a Foundation star of brown-nosing or whatever he gets away with being stupid //and// lazy.

SCP-145-J has a secondary memetic effect that has, at time of writing, affected all staff in the vicinity.  Morale among Foundation employees at Site-16 has shown a marked decrease in recent months, and confidence and faith in Foundation management is at an all-time low.  //What a fucking surprise//.  How the fuck can&#39;t we afford a new microwave?  Don&#39;t we have a skip that //makes gold?//  We shouldn&#39;t even //have// a concept of a budget, we&#39;re the Foundation for christ&#39;s sake; we spend //billions// of dollars for some overly-fancy storage locker with a bunch of dumbass redundancies so no one goes near a box that doesn&#39;t even //have// anything in it, by the way.

**Addendum:** Really?  This article got through to the system?  Who the fuck maintains our database, lobotomized monkeys?  God, I swear, it&#39;s like no one else works here.  I hate this place.</textarea></pre>
