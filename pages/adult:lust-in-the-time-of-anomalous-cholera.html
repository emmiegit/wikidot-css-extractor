&#34;Hello? Little weak people, what&#39;s wrong? Oh, all doubled over in agony from a little something? Unable to guard the containment chambers while your bowels empty? Hahaha! Oh, I will get my revenge on each and every one of you, once Montezuma is done! Hm? Oh, hello, there. Nice mask.&#34;

&#34;Hello.&#34;

&#34;Oh my, what a lovely voice you have. I do believe I&#39;m getting a fever. I am [[[SCP-353|Vector]]], Madam of Malaise, Damsel of Disease. And you, my mysterious masked malcontent?&#34;

&#34;[[[SCP-049|I... am the cure]]] for you, baby.&#34;

&#34;We&#39;ll see about that.&#34;

&#34;My cure is most effective.&#34;

&#34;Is this your doing?&#34;

&#34;No, they all suffer from The Disease.&#34;

&#34;Let me guess, //voëltjie//, the Bubonic Plague?&#34;

&#34;No, [[[scp-666-and-a-half-j|crab-stuffed mushroom]]] day at the cafeteria.&#34;

&#34;Well, that gives us time to get to know each other, doesn&#39;t it?&#34;

&#34;I already know plenty about you, dear. I sense... all the diseases in you.&#34;

&#34;Wait just a second, sweetie, I need to sample this new infection.&#34;

&#34;Did you just lick that man&#39;s anus?&#34;

&#34;Best gotten at the source. And I&#39;m going to lick more than that on you.&#34;

&#34;You&#39;ll be at it a while. My bag is quite full.&#34;

&#34;Oh my, your bag is so huge! Is that real [DATA EXPUNGED]?&#34;

&#34;The finest Corinthian [DATA EXPUNGED].&#34;

&#34;I must touch your bag.&#34;

&#34;Touch all you like, my dear. But be careful, the contents may... jostle.&#34;

&#34;Oh, when I get inside you, you&#39;ll swell in places you never expect.&#34;

&#34;It will take more than a simple palpitation to give me the tremors. But my touch will cure your ailment.&#34;

&#34;I carry over a thousand diseases. Do you honestly think a single touch will get my juices flowing?&#34;

&#34;I have a surgeon&#39;s hands, cutie, we have all night, and when I administer my cure, you will so desperately need it.&#34;

&#34;Oh! That lovely black robe... isn&#39;t a robe, is it? You&#39;re totally naked.&#34;

&#34;I see your glands flush and pulsate in antici... pation. I will relieve the pressure with my scalpels.&#34;

&#34;Mmm, show me what you can do with a little sharp pain.&#34;

&#34;I do believe I&#39;ve caught your virus.&#34;

&#34;I leave myself in your capable hands, doctor.&#34;

&#34;This... I am afraid the constant sounds of vomit and gastric distress do ruin the mood some.&#34; 

&#34;It&#39;s not exactly Beethoven.&#34;

&#34;Perhaps I should administer my cure to a few of these researchers, so that we could have some peace.&#34;

&#34;Well... I&#39;ve always wanted to make love under a fountain...&#34;

----

&#34;I say, doctor, you are a genius. Your zombies hold their place and let their stomachs empty in a quiet, compliant manner.&#34;

&#34;And without your mastery of disease, we would not be able to maintain the cafeteria infection in place after I administered my cure.&#34;

&#34;Now let us return to make love under the fountain of our own design.&#34;

&#34;This effluvium makes a most wondrous lube.&#34;

&#34;Uh... Excuse me?&#34;

&#34;What? Another doctor? Who are you?&#34;

&#34;They call me the [[[SCP-890|Rocket Surgeon]]]. I&#39;m looking to fix [[[SCP-297|Steely Dan]]].&#34;</textarea></pre>
