//Excerpt from Containment Specialist Transition Notes: SCP-3860//

&gt; **Final Notes:**
&gt; 
&gt; While SCP-3860&#39;s behavior has been increasingly compliant in the preceding months, it&#39;s important to remember that he is a known chronic emotional and psychological manipulator. It&#39;s very likely this change in behavior is a ploy to garner leniency, and from there launch a containment breach. I strongly recommend that as more of SCP-3860&#39;s systems fail, containment measures be increased. As he slowly dies, he is likely to become increasingly desperate. Should a suitable opportunity present itself, I have no doubt he is going to seize it. Stay on guard and don&#39;t let him sweet-talk you into anything that could cause trouble.
&gt; 
&gt; Take care and godspeed,
&gt;

++ Series Overview:

In the conclusion of the Anderson Robotics series, after decades of investigation, raids, and numerous agents lost, Vincent Anderson has been captured and remains in SCP Foundation custody at Site-19. With his systems failing, and time running out, it seems very likely his containment cell will prove to be his tomb. However, a splinter cell of Maxwellists has other plans for the cyborg...
