[[tab About The Author]]

[[=image http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/dr-whitneys-stinky-author-page/Ocean]]
Hello, I’m Dr. Whitney.  I’m a hobbyist artist and comic book writer. I also occasionally do photo manipulation and other digital art. I have a love for the ocean along with the life found within it and a lot of my art reflects this.

I have a fascination with prehistoric life and what these life forms must have looked like. This is why you will see a lot of dinosaur inspiration with my art and avatar alike. 
I have always found something magical in merging the worlds between imagination and science with ever changing re-creations of dinosaurs. They have gone from these Godzilla-like monsters to a more bird-like and empathic form and I just love that.
I hope to reflect some of this in my stories about monsters and humanities interactions with them over time and perhaps as they learn to humanize them.

[[tab It all ended as it began]]

[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/it-all-ended-as-it-began It all ended as it began ]
This was my first story.  It is far from perfect and at that time I was still struggling to understand what worked on the wiki. The story is about nature overcoming the damage man has done and how if the world were to end, eventually the world would move on and perhaps start anew.

[[tab The Idea Of Justice]]

[http://www.scpwiki.com/the-idea-of-justice The idea of justice ]

The idea of justice was a character study depicting the different approaches to people coming to terms with what they had done wrong. I struggled with dialogue and narrative for this story.  However, it was where I first started to grasp the building blocks of building a narrative.

[[tab Day Trip &amp; Spin In The Library]]


[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/day-trip Day Trip]

This is, I believe, the first story where I was fully able to understand and write the story I wanted to tell. It was based around SCP-507 finding happiness and realizing he deserved to be happy. I learned a lot while writing this and while it’s far from perfect, I am happy with the outcome.
