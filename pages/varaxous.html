&gt; This originally started as a stupid joke I came up with when I heard &#39;embryo.&#39; I used it with my friends for while, then it sort of died out. Fast forward about 2 months, I had an epiphany, started writing it, had another epiphany for the ending log, and now here we are. 
&gt; Nothing deep about it, it&#39;s exactly as the title says.

&gt; On the article itself: I had the idea for this article while on the toilet. Originally, it was more or less just &#39;the self-inserting character is revealed to be the reader using a list users module.&#39; Eventually, I realized (with the help of some people :P) that while the list users module was bad, the other parts of the idea. So I started drafting it, took about a month, when the SCP-910 slot was put under the deletion vote. Rushing to complete the article, I got the interview and incident log done before waiting for the slot to be deleted. Sadly, I didn&#39;t get the slot, but I eventually decided to post. I&#39;ve made a few changes to it as well.
&gt; On Sam Micheals: Sam Micheals was originally made from a typo of sammich in #site19 with [[*user MaliceAforethought]]. Thus, he became an interdimensional sammich thief in that immediate moment. Not to say he wasn&#39;t one before hand. I would look out for some things with him in the future.

&gt; The concept of a character breaking the 4th wall in a play, questioning why their friends were singing, experiencing non-existence during the times they weren&#39;t on-stage, eventually being confronted with their own fictional existence as a character before the audience. Not the most original, but it was mine. Fast forward about 3 months (My writing takes awhile ok), [[*user Darkstuff]] was dumping ideas in a side channel, when he started talking about a moving production that forced the residents to participate in the production. It was a match made in heaven.
&gt; 
&gt; Working with [[*user Darkstuff]] was awesome, one of my favorite experiences on this entire site. Everything, from brainstorming, to drafting, to finally posting, was an absolutely amazing experience. &lt;3

&gt; This was made as a part of [[*user rimple]]&#39;s draft swap project (which you should be hearing about more after the 4K contest). I got [[*user 9volt]]&#39;s 3K draft and began spicing up. Once it got back to [[*user 9volt]], she added the logs at the end, spiced it up some more, and it remained in that draft limbo for a while. 
&gt; 
&gt; And then the original 1548 was deleted. We couldn&#39;t possibly pass up the opportunity to post it in that slot and raced to get it ready to post. And it was.
&gt; 
&gt; In my original draft, before [[*user 9volt]] got it, it was a lot more similiar to missions statement. In that version, the sun was not only making these events, it was also projecting an image of extra-solar space. Eventually, that field began to wear out, leaving the starry night sky devoid of its stars.

&gt; This tale was made for the Anomalous Object tale challenge. The challenge is simple: create a tale based off of an item in the list of Anomalous Objects. The one I chose I actually gave critique prior to the author posting it. I remember being very intrigued in the object I chose, as to me, it was the perfect example of an Anomalous Object. It told a story in a single sentence, which could be interpreted in a vast number of ways. And so it was that I had to write a tale for it when I saw the challenge.
