The Department of History (DoH) is responsible for uncovering and studying information regarding the anomalous and its influence on historical or modern events. Within its ranks are some of the Foundation&#39;s most skilled researchers, forensics, psychologists and archaeologists. As a result, the Department often works with several other divisions, assisting in research, containment and diplomacy, particularly with its sister department, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/department-of-mythology-and-folkloristics-hub|The Department of Mythology and Folkloristics]]]. Due to this importance and work-load, the Department has formed a number of sub-divisions:

* **Department of Public History:** Often working with the Disinformation Bureau, this division helps uncover and alter public records that reference historical events related to the anomalous.
* **Department of Antiquity:** This division, composed mostly of archaeologists, studies and contains anomalous artefacts of historical value or related to ancient civilizations.
* **Department of Anthropology:** This division studies the impact of the anomalous on human society and culture.
* **Department of Xenohistory:** Founded following the discovery of SCP-████ in 1932, this division focuses on uncovering and studying historical events that have occurred off-world or within extradimensional locations.
* **Department of Diplomatic History:** Founded after the signing of the //Dartmoor Agreement//, this division focuses on studying historical events relating to People and Groups of Interest.
* ###7a7a7a|**Department of Anomalous Chronology:** This division studies the timeline and anomalous alterations to it.## - //###895125|Pending initiation##//

Due to the wealth of documents, books and essays that can be found at Site-12, the Department of History has made Site-12 its permanent headquarters.

Sector 3 is one of Site-12&#39;s primary points of notoriety. Overseen by the Department of History and Archival Department, Site-12&#39;s library houses the largest collection of anomalous history within the Foundation and continues to grow[[footnote]] Similarities to [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1986|SCP-1986]]] have been noted. Research into how new items continue to manifest within the library is ongoing.[[/footnote]]. Believed to have once been a wing within the Wanderer&#39;s Library, the library still possesses numerous anomalous properties similar to its home dimension. Its most prominent property being it possesses some degree of sentience and will react aggressively if threatened. Therefore, personnel who enter the library are implored to treat it with respect and care.

++++ Southern Facility (Monitoring &amp; Power Plant)
* **Sector 1 (Partially Subterranean):** Activity Stations
Houses several satellites, radios and detectors which are used in tandem with other mainland sites to monitor the British Isles for anomalous activity.
* **Sector 2 (Partially Subterranean/Subaqueous):** Hydroelectric Power Station
Constructed in 1932, Site-12&#39;s hydroelectric power station provides power for the entire site. After several further upgrades, by 1971, the site officially became off-grid, allowing it to continue proper containment without being affected by the UK&#39;s energy crises. Since its construction, the station has only received one major issue, which occurred in 1992, when a conference between Site-12 and 44 resulted in several hippocampi breaching containment.

++++ Above-Ground Facility (Personnel and Welfare)
* **Sector 1:** Staff Housing and Medical Centre
All staff are provided with living quarters. All quarters include a bed, a desk, a bedside table, cabinets, and a poster reading &#34;//Knowledge is not power. Wisdom is power//&#34;. Adjacent is the medical centre, containing surgical, dental and recuperative facilities.
* **Sector 2:** Recreational Centre and Canteen
Recreational Centre and Canteen are located on the site&#39;s eastern side, facing the River Avon. The centre is up-to-date and fully equipped to make on-site personnel as comfortable as possible and includes a gym, prayer rooms, garden and lounge. The canteen is open 24/7 and provides meals for all dietary preferences.
* **Sector 3:** Humanoid Containment - //###895125|Currently under renovation.##//
Before the 1980s, Site-12 rarely dealt with sapient or sentient anomalies, so most of its containment facilities were unsuitable for humanoid management. Since then, under the pressure of //Project Signal-Man// and the //Dartmoor Agreement//, Site-12 has built and expanded a small containment facility for humanoid anomalies.

++++ Off-Site (Experimentation)
* **Area 1:** Open Experimentation and Task Force Training
Stationed 15km north of Site-12, between the Lynch Tor and Black Dunghill. Area 1 is co-owned by the Foundation and the Ministry of Defence. The Foundation usually uses the area to experiment with thaumaturgical, ecological or mechanical anomalies. It has also occasionally been used for Task Force training. Due to the area being found in the centre of Dartmoor National Park, the Department of Thaumaturgy has placed TS-088[[footnote]] A mnesiological semioglyph which provides an antimemetic cloak over a given area. Subjects who enter the area following its activation will become disinterested in further exploration and leave.[[/footnote]] over the area to prevent any discovery and protect the public.

++ __Site Overview &amp; History__
[[/=]]

Site-12 operates as the secondary hub for the Foundation’s operations within and around the British Isles.

Following the establishment of the Foundation in the late 19th century, there was a great rush of documentation, both regarding the logistics of the Foundation&#39;s workings and the increase of anomalous activity that was occurring following the armistice of the Sixth Occult War. To compensate for this increase in information, and commandeering of several sites[[footnote]]After its establishment, the Foundation took control of all of HMFSCP&#39;s sites. This included Site-Green (now Site-44), Site-Red (now Site-46) and Site-Blue (##blue|{{**Forgotten, but not gone**}}##).[[/footnote]], the Foundation commissioned several new sites.

[[include component:image-block

|caption=The Library (CSF-S-3)

|align=right]]

During planning, the Foundation discovered documentation from the British Occult Service, detailing a damaged Rosen-Fortune Bridge (&#34;Way&#34;) located near the Eastern White Barrow, South Brent. Investigations confirmed this and lead to the discovery of a completed dimensional extrusion between baseline reality and Nx-01 (&#34;The Wanderer&#39;s Library&#34;). Numerous books cases and shelves containing books, essays and documents were also discovered at the location along with a noticeable, yet subsiding, level of Akiva Radiation. Further investigation couldn&#39;t find any reason for the extrusion and attempts to contact the area&#39;s landowner also met with failure.

Before the area could be classified as a neutralised anomaly, the Engineering Division, seeing the potential of the location&#39;s thaumaturgic and historical influence and its proximity to FP-01 (&#34;Three Portlands&#34;), proposed setting up a facility within the area. After detailed analysis, the proposal was accepted and the construction of Site-12 began on 25 January 1871. Utilising the Avon River, the library and the surrounding facilities were covered and a dam was constructed[[footnote]] Public records document its construction to be in 1957. This was due to the surrounding thaumactivity unintentionally granting the dam antimemetic properties. This property subsided in 1957.[[/footnote]], flooding the valley and hiding the site underneath the resulting reservoir. Construction finished on 24 June 1871 and its facilities were open for usage on 1 July 1871. As the Foundation&#39;s efforts and workload increased worldwide, Site-12&#39;s capability soon became invaluable. This was especially apparent when Site-Blue was abandoned in 1893 when [DATA EXPUNGED][[footnote]] ##blue|{{**We do not speak of such things.**}}## [[/footnote]].

As the century turned, Site-12 facilities continued to grow. However, this development wasn&#39;t entirely by design. In 1903, during an inspection, the Engineering Division discovered that Site-12&#39;s library had gained a further 13 floors. Luckily, the expansion wasn&#39;t the result of another extrusion and the Department of Thaumaturgy determined that it was due to the library retaining some of its home dimension&#39;s thaumaturgic properties. As the expansion was non-threatening and useful, Site-12 wasn&#39;t decommissioned, although an office for the Department of Thaumaturgy was set up to manage the thaumactivity of the surrounding area and monitor the library&#39;s growing sentience.

When the Seventh Occult War began in 1939, coinciding with the Second World War, Site-12 was first told to abstain from any conflict and protect itself. This neutrality continued throughout most of the warfare, with the only exception occurring when the British Occult Service conducted experiments in weaponised thaumaturgy within the Dartmoor Training Area. However, its position changed in August 1943 when the Thule Society[[footnote]]A group of German occultists with ties to the Nazi party and the Ahnenerbe Obskuracorps, the paranormal arm of the SS.[[/footnote]] managed to storm the site, obtaining valuable documentation and abducting skilful personnel. Despite their initial success, the invasion failed when, against reasonable expectation, the Foundation received assistance from the Serpent&#39;s Hand. In the end, not only was Site-12 most unscathed, but the Foundation gained substantial information about the Thule Society&#39;s plans. The reason for the Hand&#39;s appearance and assistance remains unknown.

When the Global Occult Coalition formed following the end of the wars, many Veil protocols received an overhaul, both within the Foundation and other Veil-preserving organisations. This tighter grip increased anomalous migration and threatened the already delicate relations between the anomalous community and the Foundation. To find a more suitable agreement, on 21 May 1946, a meeting was held at Site-12 between the Foundation and several representatives of the anomalous community. After 6 days of deliberation, the Foundation finally created the //Dartmoor Agreement//[[footnote]]Details regarding the agreement and its strands are exclusive to the Site Director, Ethics Committee Liaison and Department Heads.[[/footnote]], with the intention of forming cooperative and supportive relations with the community. As part of the agreement, the Foundation established a humanoid containment unit at Site-12 and set up offices for the Department of Anomalous Humanoid Psychology, the Department of External Affairs and the Department of Humanoid Risk Assessment.

During the late 20th century, Europe saw a dramatic increase in spectral entities and activities, with the British Isles especially seeing an increase. To combat this rise, the Department of Spectral Affairs was created and began several projects continent-wide, with //Project Signal-Man// focusing on the British Isles and setting up an office in Site-12. Site-12 was able to easily take on this workload, as a few years prior the newly built Site-91 took over much of its thaumaturgical research.

Since its formation in the late 19th century and expansion, Site-12 remains one of the British Isles&#39; most pivotal sites and has helped the Foundation greatly in its historical, spectral, mythological and thaumaturgical research. Along with Site-24, [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-44 Site-44], Site-46, and [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/hecatoncheires-cycle-hub Site-91], Site-12 will continue to serve the Foundation in protecting humanity and exploring the unknown.
