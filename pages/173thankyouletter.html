Well SCP Community, our precious &#34;peanut&#34; turns 15 today meaning that we have been around way longer than most online communities could even dream of and longer than what our founders could have possibly imagined! It is incredible that a little poorly spelled and inconsistent 4chan post led us down the route that ended up with almost 7,000 SCP articles and thousands of other pages like tales, formats, art, and so forth. We have a vibrant community of writers, readers, and artists on the site as well as an incredible group of artists, content creators, and fans outside of the Wiki. So many people have been able to obtain enjoyment and entertainment by viewing or contributing to content on and off the site and it is truly a blessing to see where such a wonderful and passionate community can take us! I know that I am incredibly thankful for the experience I have received from the Wiki and the people I have been able to interact with who love it as much as I do. We have a rich history and an untold future that is bound to be flooded with creativity the likes of which the world has never seen. Thank you, SCP, and happy birthday, 173!

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
I&#39;m thankful to the SCP community for providing a place to write stories that are less &#34;literary&#34; and more clinical in tone and feel, and for giving me interesting stories that have spurred mine imagination and taught me that even mere written words can induce a sense of horror. I&#39;m thankful to INT in particular for giving me a place where I can practice my translating from multiple languages.
Above all else, however, I&#39;m deeply thankful for the people I&#39;ve met and friendships I&#39;ve gotten to build during my time on INT. That community helped me get through some of the most difficult chapters of my life, and I will always fondly remember them and the times we had even long after I&#39;m no longer active in the community.

I&#39;ll never forget reading down old Series 1, that night at 2 am in the middle of 2010. The fiction that grew from a throwaway creepypasta in a shithole corner of the internet has become a thriving, evolving juggernaut of communities on a global level. I wouldn&#39;t be the same person without meeting my friends and colleagues here. The power in this site is undeniable, and for better or for worse, I wouldn&#39;t trade a moment of the last 12 years away for anything.

God, I don&#39;t even know where to start. As someone who&#39;s always struggled socially, the SCP Wiki really allowed me to meet new people and socialize; this is where I found some of my closest friends, and it has allowed me to get through a pretty dark time in my life. Moreover, a lot of my growth as an individual (maturity, learning, growing, figuring shit out, etc.) has been largely due in part to me being introduced to SCP and becoming a member of the community.

Getting to know and talking to some key members of the community has been largely what&#39;s allowed me to evolve from being my previous shitty and annoying stereotypical teenager-self, to a more tolerable, slightly different type of shitty and annoying stereotypical teenager.

On another note, my introduction to SCPs in written-form was what really got me into reading &amp; writing in general. Prior to that, I had no interest in such activities, and after finally finding a topic of writing I enjoyed, it gave me motivation to teach myself how to write, and has gotten me into reading; which has allowed me to immerse myself in the broad universe that is literature, and find enjoyment from it. From when I first read SCP-184 at 10-years-old where I was too scared to take a shower for two weeks to now, SCP has been a huge part of my life, and I hope to make it an even bigger part of my life in the future.

I’m thankful for all the stories, inspiration, and fascination this community has given me for so many years. I’ve been able to meet cool people and learn new things that I might never have been able to otherwise. I love SCP, and I hope to continue creating and assisting here for many years to come.

I am grateful for the huge body of work that people have come up with around the concept of the SCP Foundation. I am even more thankful for the wonderful community that&#39;s grown up around these works, both on and off the wiki. And most of all, I&#39;m grateful for the many wonderful friends and colleagues I&#39;ve met through this website. Thank you all for making my life that much more special.

If someone had told me a year ago that I&#39;d be able to write fiction and that people would actually read it, I&#39;d have called them insane. This community, however, showed me that you can accomplish anything if you really want to, and for that I&#39;ll always and forever be thankful.

I genuinely don&#39;t think I&#39;d be where I am today if it wasn&#39;t for this community and the friends I&#39;ve made because of it. It&#39;s helped me out of some real tough situations and I genuinely couldn&#39;t thank all of it enough.

I found the SCP-Wiki in the backend of a tough part of my life. I struggled a lot and wasn&#39;t sure where to go. Finding the wiki gave me motivation to do something, and finding that ability to get up and do a bit of writing was so important for getting me to keep going. I&#39;ve only written a bit but I&#39;ve made lots of friends on this small slice of the internet and for that I am so thankful. I try and help out now and then where I can and even though I don&#39;t write as often I still really enjoy being a part of something a bit bigger than me. So for helping me move past my dark place and turn into a me that I am happy with, I am thankful.

Participating in the SCP Foundation has changed my perspective on leadership and getting tasks done. Developing the mindset and resolve to complete Licensing work, Community Outreach projects, and moderate several aspects of the community required intense internal development and introspection, sometimes by force. This development, however, has improved me for the better, and I cannot thank the SCP Wiki enough, and our funny statue friend, for it.

The best aspect of SCP-173 is that very number, and the possibility space that it implied - a universe filled to the brim with impossible things, and the thin line keeping us from them. We&#39;ve spent fifteen years teasing out the full implications of those seven characters, and I look forward to fifteen more.

As the person who ended up removing 173&#39;s image, I&#39;ve had a complex relationship with the article. On one hand, it&#39;s shown me just how much annoyance comes with being marketable, and lord knows I&#39;ve had to toss my weight around as licensing staff to prevent copyright violations. On the other hand, this tiny article that barely takes up half of your desktop screen is responsible for me meeting some of my closest friends, and for convincing me to take the first step into a new career path. As much as I enjoy complaining about all the headaches this little peanut has given me, I do genuinely still love the article both for what it is and what it represents. 173 created an entire new subgenre among internet fiction, creating a community that spans over one hundred thousand members onsite, and many more offsite. It has inspired games both directly and indirectly, and has resulted in an entire site that hosts fiction from the scale of a brief sentence to an entire novella, all accessible for free to anyone who wishes to read them. 173 represents the culmination of a love of reading, and the desire to impart that love onto others. Above all, 173 represents the freedom to build upon each other&#39;s works, resulting in both extensive canons and fanworks that couldn&#39;t be possible without the generosity of moto42 putting the article under CC BY-SA 3.0.

Thank you, 173. And thank you, the community, for upholding the spirit of 173 for as long as you have.

Core to the idea of SCP is the belief that within almost any scenario, no matter how implausible or ridiculous, the human imagination can evoke a full range of emotions. I love being surprised how each and every writer uses their tools and experience to put their impossible-to-recreate spin on what presents as often very simple themes. Wonder is often in short supply, and the Wiki helps me find it almost every day.

I am immensely grateful for the opportunity to be part of a such a community comprised of brilliant individuals; it is extraordinarily powerful how the unity behind this community-driven project managed to continuously improve it to be one of the greatest collections of bibliographic material that, in its collection, represent an exceptional hallmark of creativity, and fellowship.

It would be remiss not to cite the folks from our communities, regardless of branch, creed, or nationality; each, and every single one of you represent an incredibly courageous, and talented individual by taking your time to contribute to the development, and growth of this collection with everything you do; by creating content, by consuming the content, by engaging with the content, by engaging with each, and every single member of this community for reasons within, or without.

I am thankful for having the cognisance to recognise this once-in-a-generation opportunity; I am specially grateful for being capable of engaging with the content the SCP community makes; I am specially grateful for engaging with those who I consider dear friends from the SCP community.

Thank y&#39;all.
