    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>Days continued to pass after the encounter, and everyday, you would think to yourself, &#34;god, hell was that guy&#39;s deal. All I did was use a non-cc compliant image and they&#39;re trying to //kill me!//&#34; You don&#39;t think much of it afterwards until you decide to check O5 Command a week after the encounter.

...oh. 

Wait. No, that&#39;s not what happened, right? That wasn&#39;t a conflict fought on an internet forum, that was real combat! Blood was shed! You nearly died!

But, then you wonder. Wait, you did //both// of those things. You wrote an anomalous Denny&#39;s then had a slapfight with an SCP Wiki moderator. You also walked up to a Denny&#39;s that, let&#39;s be honest, was probably anomalous and had a literal slapfight with said moderator.

The only logical explanation is that the Wiki is being forcefully translated into reality and that you&#39;re living in two simultaneous realities that are merging. 

...

Either that or they put some funky shit in the Denny&#39;s liquor.</textarea></pre>
