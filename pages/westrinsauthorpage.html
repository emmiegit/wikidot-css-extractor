**Name:** Westrin

**Security Clearance:** Fluctuating

**Duties:** Standing here within the sea of static

**Site of Operations:** Site-551

**Rating Module:**

[[module rate]]

**Profile:** Dr. Westrin is a concept. Reports state that Dr. Westrin is a living being that has helped with several SCPs and SCP reports. Others report that Dr. Westrin never existed, and his name just appeared within the database abruptly. Whatever is the case, the O5 Council has determined that Dr. Westrin serves a purpose, and his continued existence is required for the continued existence of the Foundation and its doctors.

He thinks he&#39;s good at writing SCP reports, this is yet to be determined.

&gt; **Note from O5-8:** Doctor Westrin, personnel pages are supposed to be serious. We aren&#39;t a circus, we are a secret organization. This doesn&#39;t make sense, we see you every day. You&#39;re not some anomalous concept or something. Grow up and fix the page, now. 
&gt;
&gt;&gt; **Note from Dr. Westrin:** I see nothing wrong here. Besides, what are you going to do, fire me?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; **Note from O5-8:** Yes. You&#39;re fired.
&gt;&gt;&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Author Commentary;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br&gt; ------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-3761&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-3761:&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;m still pretty proud of this one. I can&#39;t exactly explain why but it definitely reads a lot like a first SCP, the biggest culprit being the weird decision to lump in &#34;every squirrel on Earth&#34; into the anomaly, taking up a paragraph and a half. Also, I&#39;m not that proud of the containment procedures nowadays, I used to think they were really good. Besides that, final note is still funny to me and the first collapsible still holds up imo. 
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-1831&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-1831:&lt;/a&gt; Many people consider this my best work and I can&#39;t exactly disagree. The feelings in this article are all very personal to me, and are inspired by an irl event. Sometimes I look back at the dialogue and think it needs a bit of cleaning up, but another part of me says that it adds to the charm. Not sure.
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-4050&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-4050:&lt;/a&gt; I forgot for a long while after I wrote it, but I&#39;m fairly certain this article is inspired by a video of somebody swimming into this &#34;secret underwater cavern&#34; that&#39;s available through a tunnel underwater that is only wide enough to fit one person. When watching that, I remember thinking to myself &#34;well that&#39;s fuckin&#39; terrifying,&#34; specifically the thought that if you needed to go up for air, you first needed to worm yourself through this very very small tunnel before actually swimming back up for air. Pretty freaky.
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/fifthbobpentapants&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;Patrick Becomes Enlightened:&lt;/a&gt; The reason my first tale is in the format of a script is because, at this point, I sucked absolute ass at traditional prose. My strong suits were the clinical style of SCP articles, and other esoteric stuff like that. This is because before getting into SCP, I had like zero (good) writing experience. So it was like starting from the ground up. That being said, this is a lot more popular than I initially thought it would be, and I&#39;m happy about that cuz I&#39;m still proud of this. &#34;In its eye, we are all prime&#34; is still one of the best lines I have ever written.
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-4991&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-4991:&lt;/a&gt; For most of this article&#39;s lifetime, it featured actual screen caps of the websites featured. fishingenthusiest used inspect element to create them. After a little licensing fiasco it was replaced with CSS. While I am proud of it, there are a ton of bits that I want to clean up a bit. Though I&#39;m kinda hesitant to change it cuz it&#39;s already at an extremely comfortable rating (understatement and a half). Also, it was my first ever article that reached +100. Pretty fun.
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-4135&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-4135:&lt;/a&gt; The original plan for this was something very much inspired by SCP-3008, in the sense that it would have journal pages from somebody that was &#34;targeted&#34; by an invincible killer goose, slowly showing their descent into insanity as their normal life is taken away from them by the silliest thing imaginable: a duck. After not knowing how to successfully accomplish this, I settled on invoking the relatable imagery of &#34;duck that will NOT leave you alone&#34; that a lot of people can attest to have experienced.
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-3748&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-3748:&lt;/a&gt; seagull initially approached me on this idea, the idea was already basically fully formed at that point (incel bowl of flies), they just asked me if I wanted to collab on it, which I agreed to, cuz it sounded fun. And it was, and still is. I&#39;m fairly certain I worked on the interview logs while seagull wrote the actual SCP base. I once suggested to them that the title be &#34;A Nice Fly&#34; but they insisted that it be &#34;A Bowl of Flies.&#34;
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-4335&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-4335:&lt;/a&gt; I think I can confidently say that this article is the one that I will always be known for. It was initially inspired by a thumbnail to a video by a channel called NewScapePro. They had made a video about their OC SCP or something called &#34;SCP-4000&#34;, which was posted before the SCP-4000 contest. I saw that thumbnail (&lt;a href=&#34;https://i.gyazo.com/d39940f1db96bd64f0534e5dfec7ba62.png &#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) and wondered what it would be like if an anomaly was actually inside of Minecraft, and that all the containment procedures are like &#34;SCP-yaddayadda is contained in an 5x5 iron block chamber&#34; and stuff like that. The fact that it&#39;s also completely black in color is also a reference to the thumbnail, although I forget if I was inspired by anything for the tendrils. And no, I didn&#39;t know that Null existed when I wrote this.
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-4521&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-4521:&lt;/a&gt; I think I got the idea for this because I wanted to write a &#34;thing is non-anomalous but the Foundation doesn&#39;t act like it is&#34; articles that we have a couple of, but with my own twist. The imagery of it kinda freaked me out when I first thought of it, which is what made me actually write it. I like it, but the fact that it was posted for the Jamcon prompt &#34;Shaggy Dog Story&#34; kinda crippled it hard in regards to the ending, and I want to change that up a tiny bit here soon. Also, this is apparently my most popular article in the SCP-TikTok community, which I find really funny.
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-3657&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-3657:&lt;/a&gt; Speaking of Jamcon, this was written for the second day&#39;s prompt, a day after 4521 was posted, but it received mixed reception when it was posted. Nico offered to rewrite and repost it, so he did. I like his version a lot better. Also Pulp Fiction is one of the best films of all time.
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-4559&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-4559:&lt;/a&gt; This is the shortest time I&#39;ve spent on an article from brainstorming to posting, where it took about an hour, without anybody critting it. I&#39;m... incredibly surprised at the reception that it has gotten, seeing how little time I spent on it, but I&#39;m not complaining. The general format of the SCP in how it&#39;s presented is inspired by SCP-3022.
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-4098&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-4098:&lt;/a&gt; I saw Henzoid link an early version of this in discord, and I decided to critique it. He then offered if I wanted co-author credit, which to that I said &#34;yeah sure.&#34; We then changed it a bit more and then posted. 
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-4885&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-4885:&lt;/a&gt; This was inspired by a meme that a friend of mine posted which went like &#34;in soviet russia, waldo finds you&#34; which inspired me to make a waldo murder monster. Early in development, this was meant to be a much more character focused piece, focusing on an O5 Council member and their experiences with the anomaly and how it has interfered with their personal life, but I scrapped all that and just focused on the scary monster part, which seemed to have worked. Also this was inspired by SCP-4975, which is a great article you should go read it.
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-4831&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-4831:&lt;/a&gt; I don&#39;t have much to add that I didn&#39;t already add in the author post. However, an interesting fact is that in its early drafts, there was a lot more talk regarding Mr. and Mrs. Miles&#39; marriage being... less than ideal. Not abusive, just not compatible. Also the ending was originally a suicide attempt that I didn&#39;t think fit in the piece as a whole. It&#39;s a pretty important piece to me, I&#39;m happy it&#39;s done this well.
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-4932&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-4932:&lt;/a&gt; This is inspired by Slenderman found footage films like Marble Hornets and the like, but the actual anomaly bit was inspired by this weird ass movie called &#34;Nothing&#34; (you can watch it &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hacC3KgcELY&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and if I told you how I was inspired by it, it would probably spoil a good chunk of the movie so I suggest you watch it instead, I bet you&#39;ll get the connection after watching it.
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-1926&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-1926:&lt;/a&gt; I had brainstormed the idea of &#34;Airworld but SCP&#34; before Arcadia became an actual established GoI, but only had it posted after the whole &#34;new GoI craze&#34; kinda wore off. I wrote most of it, and had a lot of it cleaned up by somebody who wishes not to be named. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m really proud of this, I have plans on replacing it with something much better, without all the past baggage, look out for that relatively soon.
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-5899&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-5899:&lt;/a&gt; Twas my first and only entry into the 2020 Jamcon. The idea came from a meme I saw on some random political subreddit where it was like &#34;see where different candidates stand on the issues that matter&#34; and bernie sanders said &#34;horses don&#39;t exist, but they SHOULD&#34; which got the gears turning. But instead of horses, it&#39;s cows, cuz cows are funnier.
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-5991&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-5991:&lt;/a&gt; This one is inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://i.redd.it/bscwo0sasx741.png&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;the mystery flesh pit&lt;/a&gt; which is a piece of worldbuilding that I think is very good. Also, while I&#39;ve seen a bunch of very insightful commentary on the SCP, and I don&#39;t want to discourage that, in fact I want more of it it&#39;s fun, I admit that I intended this to be 50% &#34;consumerism is tainting religion&#34; and 50% a pun on the word consumerism.
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-5045&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-5045:&lt;/a&gt; In my opinion, this is mostly ratking666&#39;s SCP. He did nearly all the conceptual heavy lifting, and gave the story the life that it has. My main contribution was the Containment Procedures (it previously had a reference to Goat Simulator but I think ratking removed it), some of the description, and the entire idea of the ending. Definitely the most fun I&#39;ve had collaborating on an SCP in recent memory.
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-5615&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-5615:&lt;/a&gt; Did you know that, before this point, there was only a single tale and no SCPs that mentioned World of Warcraft? I was surprised by that fact and had an idea to integrate World of Warcraft and The Gay™ into an SCP for the Cupid Contest. Surprisingly only my second SCP based inside of a video game, and also the second most popular of that criteria by a country mile.
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/youmedennysnow&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;You. Me. Denny&#39;s Parking lot. Now:&lt;/a&gt; This actually isn&#39;t the first &#34;Choose Your Own Adventure&#34; tale on the site! There might be a couple besides this one, but the main one I&#39;m thinking about was submitted in the D-Class Contest 2016 called &lt;a href=&#34;http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/cat-in-a-box&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;Cat In A Box&lt;/a&gt; where instead of tabs, you click on collapsibles to progress forward. As you can probably tell, LurkD put significantly more effort into theirs in almost every category, but at least my story has you punch the shit out of a Wiki Moderator, so we&#39;re about equal in quality.
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-6779&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-6779:&lt;/a&gt; Inspired by the countless times my dog knew full well I was mad at her for eating my things and intentionally acted cute so that I wouldn&#39;t get onto her. Not much beyond that. I like it.
&lt;br&gt; ----------
&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/scp-6779&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;SCP-7987:&lt;/a&gt; One time an old friend of mine got so mad at MW2 (the old one) that he, in a fit of rage, shot his monitor with his slingshot, which cracked it to the point where it was unusable. It was as funny as it sounds.
