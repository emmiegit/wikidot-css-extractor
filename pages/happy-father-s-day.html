**Item #:** SCP-001

**Object Class:** Archon

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-001 should not be contained.

**Description:** SCP-001 is artist and illustrator Andrew Bosley.

SCP-001 is subject to an impassible effect, which causes certain opinions of him to be universally held as fact. These opinions regarding SCP-001 are collectively shared by all with sufficient knowledge of SCP-001.

The following statements regarding SCP-001 are objectively true:

* SCP-001 is a talented and creative artist.
* SCP-001 is a fantastic father.
* SCP-001 is a loving person.

**Addendum 001.1:** The following letter had been sent to SCP-001 from his son.

&gt; Almost a year ago, I came to you with a draft for a short story. It was a silly little thing about a computer with delusions of grandeur and no one to take him seriously. I took it to you not only because you&#39;re so skilled in art and writing, but because I knew that you would be willing to help me. You didn&#39;t treat me like a child, nor did you tell me I was wasting my time. You encouraged me to pursue the passion I was showing, and also helped me in growing it and learning.
&gt; 
&gt; Fast forward to now. That article&#39;s been up for a long time, and did pretty well. I&#39;ve continued to pursue writing, and I&#39;ve gotten pretty good at it! But the reason it did so well, or that I even felt the courage to post it at all, was because you encouraged and inspired me. Without your help, I likely would have let my writing fall away, and never would have learned how much I enjoyed it or how good I could be at it.
&gt; 
&gt; The reason I&#39;m telling this story is because I realize it&#39;s perfectly encapsulated just the kind of person you are, and how wonderful of a father you&#39;ve been. I am beyond grateful that you&#39;ve pushed me to use the gifts and talents I have to strengthen myself, and the least I can do is use those talents to give back to you.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for all you&#39;ve given me, dad. I&#39;m glad I can celebrate you and your achievements this Father&#39;s Day, and I hope you continue to remain an inspiration to the people you meet and guide.
&gt; 
&gt; I love you.
&gt; 
&gt; Happy Father&#39;s Day.
