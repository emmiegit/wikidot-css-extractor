+ After-action Report regarding the raid on Volk Division HQ on 8-5-2022 

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;papernote&#34;]]

**Background:** On January 2nd, 2022, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/valravn-corporation-hub |Valravn Coporation]]] forces engaged and defeated a Three Moons Initiative vanguard. Valkyrie technical specialists learned from the recovered data from the destroyed drones that they had been sent to locate a set of nine anomalous books. These books could supposedly be used to &#34;turn Corbenic into a paradise&#34;.

Corporation Intelligence would initially dismiss this as simple Corbenic superstition but Valravn informants later confirmed the presence of an anomalous [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6419 |tome]]] in South Africa. Two squads of Jomsvikings[[footnote]] Unaugmented elite foot soldiers of the Valravn Corporation. [[/footnote]] were deployed to the area to retrieve it. The mission was disrupted by a Chaos Insurgency Cell[[footnote]] The cell is believed to be under the command of the PoI known as the Red Scar, wanted by the GOC and SCPF for the theft of eighty known anomalies. [[/footnote]], which resulted in heavy losses and the loss of the tome.

Afterward, R.U.N.N.E.S[[footnote]] The Retroactive Unified Neural Network Escathological System (RUNNES) is a powerful predictive system powered by ancient runic magic and artificial intelligence [[/footnote]] data analysis was used to extrapolate the location of other books in the Set of Nine. R.U.N.N.E.S pointed to Volk Division[[footnote]] Anomalous Russian Mercenary group known for building weapons and fielding wolf themed anomalies [[/footnote]] mercenaries who had been spotted using new anomalous weaponry whose source could not be explained by the usual providers. Coincidentally, a local government that was having trouble with the mercenaries hired Valravn to respond to the threat. Valkyrie HQ deployed elements of the Sverðmeyja[[footnote]] Icelandic for Sword Maidens. [[/footnote]] as well as units from the Androleteirai to the area to eliminate the Volk and secure any anomalous materials. The mixed unit was successful in its mission, only suffering one casualty and eliminating the Volk presence, securing the book in the process.

The book [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6952 (code named: Hephaestus&#39;s Manual)] contained a wealth of information on anomalous weapons and armor, that was promptly copied by Valravn R&amp;D. After concluding that no more useful data could be collected from the tome, the High Table authorized the trade of Hephaestus&#39;s manual with the SCP Foundation in exchange for information on an anomaly of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6755 |interest]]].

In the interim, a meeting was held by the High Table and other high-ranking Valravn officials such as Olga Brandt of the Tyr Project to decide on the next course of action regarding the Set of Nine.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ HT Table - Virtual Meeting Transcript &#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

[[div class=&#34;danke agent&#34;]]

**HT-CEO:** All members of the High Table are present and accounted for along with a representative of our Tyr Project. Now, I believe the topic of discussion is how our Corporation is moving forward regarding this... Set of Nine. Chief Operation Officer, you have the floor.

**HT-COO:** Thank you, CEO. It is the burden of this Table to ensure our sacred businesses are successful. The resources of the Corporation shouldn&#39;t be stretched thin. We have just secured an important deal from our Latin American Campaign. It ended up being a wise move to let Cristina Cisneros[[footnote]] Leader of Las Víboras, rebel splinter group of the Serpent&#39;s Hand [[/footnote]], and her rebellion last a little more. She&#39;s built a [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7269 Free Port] in Mexico and the authorities are nervous. They will pay more for our services, but if we don&#39;t deliver on time, we may lose them to our competition. Our priority should be solving the Las Víboras problem once and for all. They must not interfere with Operation Camposanto, which is a priority for our shareholders. We got what we needed from that manual. I say we let the Foundation have its books. My vote is to leave the Set be.

**HT-CEO:** Vote is 0-1 for pursuing the Set of Nine. Chief Information Officer, you may speak next.

**HT-CIO:** I disagree with our Operations Officer. As far as we know seven of these books remain and RUNNES struggles to locate even the first two. I think any artifact capable of eluding our most powerful intelligence-gathering tool is worth locating. I vote we chase after the set.

**HT-CEO:** We&#39;re 1-1. Technology Officer, you are next.

**HT-CTO:** Hephaestus&#39;s manual has proven to be the single greatest boon for our R&amp;D since the first paraprostethics came to market. If just ONE of these books can do this, then I don&#39;t care if it stretches us thinner than a Moebius strip. We need it for survival and you know my vote.

**HT-CEO:** 2-1, will anyone stand up for our poor Operations Officer?

**HT-CSO:** I will. My division is currently training Mexico&#39;s anomalous National Guard for state-of-art warfare against Cisneros&#39; Free Port. This book hunting is certainly going to exhaust our tech assets. Vote against.

**HT-CEO:** 2-2. Who would like to take the floor next?

**Brandt:** I will, while I understand the concern of the Table...

[Other members of the High Table are heard acknowledging Dr. Brandt.]

**Brandt:** It is my ultimate belief that these concerns about troop deployments are misguided. We don&#39;t have to send the core of our army to find these books. We only need to send one squad of Valkyries. I guarantee it. These books certainly have power. I don&#39;t know if that legend about remaking the world is true... but what is Valravn if not a legend that brought itself into existence? To merely pass up something like this is foolhardy. I vote to pursue it.

**HT-CEO:** 3-2. Where do Finance and Marketing stand?

**HT-CFO:** What Dr. Brandt is forgetting to mention is that a full-scale implementation of Hephaestus technology in our forces is not a profitable venture at the moment. Zenith Group is currently withholding funds until they see a demonstration of this technology. Not to mention there is no profit to be had pursuing this venture that I can see. Vote against.

**HT-CMO:** I disagree. This is a great opportunity to get to advertise our Valkyrie products to potential contractors. Who needs to hire three platoons of Jomsvikingr to clear a rebel stronghold when one Valkyrie squad can do the job? And especially if they capture this Set of books, their prowess will be known from every corner of the anomalous world! Put my vote down to pursue.

**HT-CEO:**4-3 it is. Well, I&#39;ve heard all of your arguments and it comes to me to pass the last vote. Despite some reservations, I consulted with our contacts in the GOC. The Order of the Æsir and Silicon Nornir believe the Set of Nine could to potentially forestall Ragnarok if it ever comes around. That puts us at 5-3, the motion to pursue the Set passes. Now, Intelligence Officer do you have any potential leads?

**HT-CIO:** I do. As we are aware, the Volk Division was in possession of Hephaestus&#39;s manual. Those records would be in their headquarters if they know anything else about the Set.

**HT-COO:** Are you seriously suggesting a full on assault against Logovo Volka? We&#39;d crush those dogs but do you realize how many men we&#39;d lose?

**Brandt:** We don&#39;t have to send an army, but rather just four units. I&#39;m recommending we send the squad Sverðmeyja to Logovo Volka and they will have the records we need without anyone even noticing. It&#39;s time we stopped being the hammer and rather, a scalpel.

**HT-COO:** I would have to bring up to the table that Brandt&#39;s models are highly unpredictable and their loyalty is suspect. One of these Sverðmeyja even has a history of insubordination. How can we be certain that your Valkyries can get the job done?

**Brandt:** Unit S-03 has completed every mission with flying colors, Operations Officer. With proper manipulation Unit S-03 has become a dangerous weapon against the Volk Division which is why I recommended their product line for this. My products are fully loyal to the Valravn company line, I made sure of it. Their indoctrination will not break.

**HT-CEO:** I agree with Dr. Brandt. The Sverðmeyja will be deployed to Logovo Volka as a test run for any future operations regarding the Set of Nine. This meeting is adjourned.

**Prior combat experience:** U.S Marine Infantry (Four Years), Afghanistan
**Squad Role:** Squad Leader
----

**Background:** Vanessa Poltaya was chosen for the Valkyrie program after suffering grievous injuries from an IED in Afghanistan&#39;s Kunar Province. Valravn agents monitoring female U.S marines for potential Valkyrie recruits saw an opportunity in the wounded Poltaya who faced the prospect of never walking again. Poltaya was given the choice to be given the Valkyrie augmentations or remain disabled for life. Poltaya chose the former.

Poltaya has shown exceptional loyalty to the Valravn Corporation for eight years and her squad of Sverðmeyja is among our best-performing units.

**Age:**  35
**Prior combat experience:** Finnish Peacekeeping Forces (six years)
**Squad Role:** Weapons Specialist
----

**Background:** Anja Koski comes from a line with a storied military tradition dating back to the early 1500s. Her father trained Koski in HEMA[[footnote]] Historical European Martial Arts, the art of sword fighting. [[/footnote]] and is a master-level fencer. After serving in the Finnish Peacekeeping Forces as a young woman, she was approached by Valkyrie recruiters who offered a way to increase her combat prowess. She accepted and is the only member of the Sverðmeyja to not join out of disability or personal vendetta. Despite not having the normal psychological profile of a Valkyrie, it was determined that her want to return to the days of martial melee combat on the battlefield would make her a prime candidate for the Valkyrie program.

Koski considers martial prowess the sign of a true warrior and thus eschews firearms and augmented weaponry, preferring to bring her sword into battle. Koski has also taken the youngest member of the Sverðmeyja, Sigrun under her wing and refers to her as &#34;Little Raven&#34;.

**Prior combat experience:** Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces (Two years)
**Squad Role:** Augmented Weapons Specialist/Infiltrator
----

**Background:** Sofia Lisko served as a member of the 21st Territorial Defence Battalion during the War in the Donbas, where she gained combat experience fighting against DPR forces. Two years into the conflict, Sofia came back to her home in Horlivka, only to find that her neighborhood had been raided by members of the Volk Division. Her Mother and two sisters had perished at the hands of a unit belonging to Grigori Aleksandrovich.

Valravn operatives embedded in Ukrainian forces approached Sofia, realizing that we could capitalize on her vulnerability, and offered her a spot in the Valkyrie program in order to get her vengeance. Sofia accepted without hesitation.

Now known as Sigrun, she gained a reputation for being one of the most brutal Valkyrie units. She often inflicts grievous wounds using her enhanced abilities rather than going for a quick death when her vengeful side emerges. Valkyrie HQ uses her unique Psychological profile against anomalous groups connected to the Russian government, including Volk Division. Sigrun however does have a history of occasional insubordination, in her hunt for Aleksandrovich but Valkyrie HQ sees this as a necessary compromise to keep her bloodlust sated. This bloodlust has often resulted in her being able to excel beyond the average at completing high-risk, long-duration missions compared to her sisters in arms.

**Civillian Name:** Mari Sukumiya
**Nationality:**  Japanese
**Age:**  25
**Prior combat experience:** None
**Squad Role:** Technical Support
----

**Background:** Mari Sukumiya in her previous life was considered amongst the upper echelons of Japan&#39;s hacking community. She acted similar to &#34;Robin Hood&#34;, hacking into banking institutions and the wallets of corrupt officials and redistributing the wealth amongst the poor. Due to her abilities, she was initially a candidate for the Cyber-Warfare Division. However, an unexpected turn of events led to a different outcome.

Sukumiya had made an enemy of the Shishi Ryū clan Yakuza who ended up finding her location and blinding her to send a message to those who have their eyes where they shouldn&#39;t. With the orbits of her skull nearly obliterated and unable to continue her hacking work on her own, it was determined that her current psychological profile should fit the Valkyrie program, and thus was offered a spot among their ranks. She accepted. Amongst the standard augmentations, facial reconstructive surgery was performed to repair her skull and give her a new set of eyes; allowing her to hack once more.

She was thus assigned to the Sverðmeyja as a cyber warfare operator and tech specialist.


Despite her lack of combat experience, Sukumiya has proven herself to be a capable warrior on the field; utilizing more esoteric augmentations in battle compared to her squadmates as well as drones for recon and target neutralization.

**Incident Overview:**

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Logovo Volka Mission Briefing &#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

[[div class=&#34;danke agent&#34;]]

[BEGIN LOG]

[All four members of the Sverðmeyja are present inside of the briefing room. S-04 is jacked into a Valravn-issued cyberdeck.[[footnote]] Portable device that allows the user to access FP-99, &#34;The Net&#34;. FP-99 is a digital dimension that is a full three-dimensional representation of the world&#39;s data.  [[/footnote]] S-04&#39;s appears pale and her face is sunken slightly.

**S-02:** Brynhilde, is Göndul alright? She looks sick, how long has she been inside the Net for?

[S-02 prods an unresponsive S-04.]

**S-01:** Please do not disturb Göndul, she is in the midst of prepping backdoors into enemy security for our next operation. Time is sensitive, so she&#39;s been ordered by command to work at the upper limit of Net usage that&#39;s safe for a human mind per twenty-four hours.

**S-03:** That&#39;s going to kill her, she needs a break. 

**S-01:** Code statute 12, Sigrun. There are no objections to scheduled hours. I trust that Göndul can handle it, now are we ready for the briefing?

**S-03:** Yes, you&#39;ve been keeping up in the dark for far too long. Where are we being deployed? Perhaps against Three Moons?

**S-01:** Good guess but no, that situation is complicated. Our target is something decidedly less difficult. Our squad has been tasked with the infiltration of Logovo Volka, the headquarters of the Volk Division.

[S-03 appears pleased.]

**S-03:** (laughing) Yes.. .this is what I&#39;ve been waiting for. We&#39;re going to bring Hel&#39;s fury down on those bastards! How many men are we getting?

**S-01:** It&#39;s just us Sigrun and for the record, this is a //stealth// mission and if we don&#39;t have to we&#39;ve been advised not to kill anyone.

**S-03:** (scoffs) You&#39;ve got to be fucking kidding me. They&#39;re dropping us into a den of those mangy mutts and we can&#39;t slaughter them wholesale? Grigori could be at that base. We can end the threat, right now.

**S-01:** Sigrun, I understand what they did to you and your family but we&#39;ve been over this; your emotions cannot jeopardize the mission. I don&#39;t need to tell you what happens to Valkyries who fail their missions.

**S-03:** Stop talking to me like I&#39;m a child! If I find that bastard in there, I&#39;m going to-!

[S-02 puts her hand on S-03&#39;s shoulder.]

**S-02:** Sigrun calm down, this bickering gets us nowhere. You&#39;ll have your revenge one of these days.
 
**S-03:** I&#39;m just supposed to sit while the souls of my family stay restless? Ugh, whatever. 

[S-03 looks off to the side.]

**S-03:** So what&#39;s the plan, chief?

**S-01:** A couple of days ago Dr. Brandt should have installed VFR[[footnote]] Valravn Facial Reconfiguration. A cognitohazardous augment that shows a chosen face to an onlooker rather than the user&#39;s real face. [[/footnote]] modules into your chassis. Are they operational?

**S-02:** Affirmative. 

[S-02 and S-03 activate their VFRs and their faces change accordingly.]

**S-01:** Excellent, these pre-loaded faces you were given correspond to your new identities. You&#39;ll find them under your seats. Sigrun, you are Maria Polonskaya and Herja is Valentina Vostok. You both are FSB inspectors going in for a base inspection.

**S-03:** (snickers) Got to make sure the cardboard armor those fucking Russian soldier boys were given is up to snuff. None of that weak brown stuff.

**S-01:** Very funny Sigrun. Anyways, once you get inside the base you&#39;ll head to their records room and pilfer anything worth looking at. Göndul and I will stay behind in a mobile command center monitoring the situation. Göndul will be providing assistance with any security-related issues via the Net.

**S-02:** Wait, when are we deploying?

**S-01:** 48 hours from now. Why?

**S-02:** That&#39;s too short of a recovery window, we don&#39;t need Göndul disassociating[[footnote]] Long term Net usage can lead to &#34;disassociation&#34; where a User&#39;s consciousness can become trapped within the digital world and leave their body without a &#34;driver&#34;.[[/footnote]] during the mission.

[S-04 reached behind her neck and pulls her jack out. She appears to groggily return to lucidity.]

**S-04:** I&#39;ll be fine Herja. Don&#39;t worry about me, I just finished placing all of the tools we&#39;ll need for the mission.

**S-02:** (sighs), Between you and Little Raven, I&#39;m going to have a heart attack one of these days.

**S-01:** Does anyone have any more questions?

**S-03:** Yes, actually. What happens if things go south or if we have to engage to complete the mission?

**S-01:** You all are allowed to defend yourselves of course and if push comes to shove, we fight our way out.

**S-03:** The most relieving thing I&#39;ve heard all day. Maybe we actually give Göndul some combat experience.

**S-04:** I get plenty in the Net, that&#39;s my battlefield anyways.

**S-01:** Göndul you can&#39;t live your life in there forever, one of these days you need to go outside and experience what life has to offer.

**S-04:** Yeah, I had my taste of &#34;real life&#34;. I think I&#39;ll pass.

**S-01:** Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Well if that settles everything...

**S-04:** Actually I have a question. What exactly is &#34;worth looking at&#34; in there? I assume this has to do with the book we recovered a month ago.

**S-01:** That&#39;s right. It&#39;s a part of a larger set. Intelligence believes that the Volks might know more about them.

**S-04:** Interesting, I&#39;d heard on The Net that whoever owns all the books gets to remake the world in their image... but what does that look like to the High Table?

**S-02:** I can&#39;t imagine they&#39;d stamp out insurgency entirely. Then we&#39;d be out of a job... although I&#39;d hate to think that they&#39;d keep making new rebellions for us to have to be hired to put down.

**S-03:** I&#39;d hope it be a world without the Volk Division.... where I could see my family again. Maybe could finally crush the Foundation and the GOC, then we could work unimpeded.

**S-04:** I&#39;m... not exactly sure what I&#39;d want out of a paradise but I&#39;d at least like things to get better in the countries we&#39;d get deployed too.

**S-01:** I don&#39;t exactly think the leaders who hire us care about the well-being of the people, Göndul. Regardless of what the High Table wants with them, we deploy in forty-eight hours. I expect all of you to be ready by then.

At 17:00 on the day of the operation, S-04 and S-01 set up their mobile command center about 500 meters from Logovo Volka while a separate convoy delivered S-02 and S-03. S-04 jacked into the Net and immediately go to work activating the backdoor she&#39;d placed earlier. Logovo Volka&#39;s camera footage was looped and their Net Avatars were unable to detect that S-04 was in their systems.

S-03 and S-02 arrived at the base at 17:30 where they showed their credentials and asked to be let inside. The IDs provided by the Intel Division proved to withstand scrutiny and the two were allowed inside the base. They were given a quick tour before being left alone to conduct their inspection.

**S-01:** Sigrun where are you going? The records room is in the other hallway.

**S-03:** I&#39;m taking a little detour to the Commandant&#39;s office. Herja&#39;s got the records room, she&#39;s a big girl.

**S-01:** God damn it, Sigrun! This is no time for your personal vendetta, if you get caught you’ll jeopardize the-

**S-04:** Brynhilde, if I may?

**S-01:** You may speak, Göndul.

**S-04:** I believe Sigrun may have the right idea. The Commandant most likely has keys to the rest of the base and important documents that wouldn&#39;t be left for peering eyes in the records room.

**S-03:** See? That is exactly my plan and if he has information on Grigori, then the more the merrier.

**S-01:** (//sighs//) You better be right about this. It&#39;s your head on the chopping block if this fails.

**S-03:** You know my plans always work, now hush. I need to work on my galdur[[footnote]] Icelandic for &#34;Magic&#34;. [[/footnote]].

[S-03 turns to the door and knocks on it.]

**S-03:** Maria Polonskaya, FSB inspector. Commandant, we need to talk.

**Commandant:** You may enter.

[S-03 enters the room to find the commandant writing papers at his desk. The room is a modest-looking office space with one defining feature that Sigrun focuses on for five seconds is the safe on the left.]

**S-03:** Oh. My. Goodness. [Sigrun&#39;s optical sensors run facial ID to determine the man is Commandant Mikhail Blonko, an associate of Grigori A.] You must be the great Commandant Blonko, I&#39;ve heard so much about you!

**Commandant:** Please, Inspector Polonskaya, you flatter me.

**S-03:** I mean it. I just have to ask for security reasons, is this room soundproof? I don&#39;t want any… classified information getting out. We need to keep what we say here… between us.

**Commandant:** Do not worry, inspector. This room is wholly soundproof. Now I wasn&#39;t exactly expecting an FSB inspection so late at night. What brings you to our base?

**S-03:** Well as you know we&#39;ve had to move more and more of our troops from Transnistria for other operations and had to rely increasingly on the Volk Division for security. My boss wanted to make sure that any operation security hadn&#39;t been compromised.

[S-03 approaches the front of the table and the Commandant proceeds to wrap an arm around her waist.]

**Commandant:** I can assure you that everything is secure. Let&#39;s set business aside if you don&#39;t mind. If you&#39;re looking to get a promotion, I might be able to help with that.

**S-03:** Oh, Commandant!

[S-03 slides herself onto his seat, straddling him.]

**S-03:** I must admit this trip was just an excuse to see you.

**Commandant:** I&#39;m glad that I have fans, now let&#39;s get you out of this stuffy coat.

[The Commandant attempts to raise a hand to S-03 but she grabs his wrist and a loud crunching is heard. She is believed to have shattered his wrist. The Commandant screams and S-03 rears and arm back before driving her Adamantine wrist blade into his abdomen]

**S-03:** Scream all you want you rabid dog. No one will hear you.

**Commandant:** You bitch! Why are you doing this!?

**S-03:** This is for what you did in Horlivka, do you remember the women you killed?

**Commandant:** You&#39;ll have to be more specific, we killed a lot of guerillas that day.

**S-03:** Guerillas? They were my family, you orcish swine!

[S-03 withdraws her arm and stabs him with the blade again.]

**S-03:** Where is Grigori? I&#39;m not asking again!

**Commandant:** Agh! Fuck you bitch! I&#39;m not telling you anything!

[S-03 grabs his other hand and proceeds to crush it in her grasp, fingers are bent in unnatural angles and loud crunching is heard]

**S-03:** I&#39;ll keep breaking as many bones as I need to you mangy dog! You&#39;ll feel every bit of pain my family felt, little by little....

[Further interrogation removed for brevity.]

**S-03:** Brynhilde, I have his keycard. I saw a safe in here when I entered. Moving to check it now.

**S-01:** And the Commandant?

[S-03 drags the remains of his body from the chair and over into a nearby closet]

**S-03:** He was nice enough to let me test out these new Adamantine blades. They cut through bone and flesh like it&#39;s nothing.

**S-01:** By Odin&#39;s beard, Sigrun.

**S-03:** Relax, I&#39;m hiding the body and locking the room shut. Nobody&#39;s getting in here for a few hours and we&#39;ll be long gone by then.

[S-03 places the body inside the closet and moves over to the safe. She slides the keycard into the pad and the box opens without issue. She removes a file with several papers of documentation, the description of which has not been included due to potential Cognitohazardous content.]

**S-03:** There are some files here... looks like the Volk had stumbled upon a digital copy of one of the Set of Nine. Something called &#34;Seshat&#39;s Guide to Programmable Cognitohazards.&#34;

**S-04:** Digital? Like a PDF?

**S-03:** Exactly. Says that the link to it went dead a couple of days ago but this is their research into making more Cognitohazards designed to increase recruitment rates. Sounds like our own PR department can use it instead. 

**S-04:** I agree. If your finished, Herja could use the help.

**S-03:** Yep, but I need to use the washroom and raid his closet a bit cause I&#39;m covered in blood. Once I&#39;m presentable I will rendezvous with Herja. Sigrun, out.

**S-02:** Brynhilde, I&#39;m approaching the records room now.

**S-01:** Affirmative. Keep me posted on your status. Also, do you mind telling me why you let Sigrun go off on her own to potentially jeopardize our mission?

**S-02:** Little Raven needs a little more blood on her ledger if she&#39;s to get to Valhalla. I thought at least you could understand that.

**S-01:** I understand that but she needs to let this whole Grigori thing go. She&#39;s been getting reckless and it&#39;s going to get us all killed.

**S-02:** I&#39;d gladly die fighting the Skíthælar[[footnote]] Icelandic for bastards. [[/footnote]] who took her family away from her. [S-02 stops before turning the corner, a Volk Mercenary appears once her vision turns to X-Ray/Thermals] We&#39;ll talk about this later, I am here.

[S-02 walks out to the soldier guarding the records room.]

**S-02:** Comrade. [She pulls out her badge.] Valentina Vostok, FSB. I&#39;m going to need to see your records room.

**Volk 1:** Your accent is a little strange, FSB woman. But even if that badge checks out, I&#39;ve been instructed not to let anyone through. There is very sensitive information in here and you should probably just keep walking.

**S-02:** I have a bit of a cough, thank you very much. Secondly, you deny an agent of the FSB access to your records? What are you hiding in there?

**Volk 1:** Look ma&#39;am, I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re Vladimir Putin himself. You can take it up with the Commandant if you don&#39;t like it.

**S-02:** He&#39;s a little… preoccupied at the moment. Stomach problems, you know, from his recent surgery.

**Volk 1:**Regardless, keep moving ma&#39;am.

**S-02:** Fine. I&#39;ll keep walking.

[S-02 walks away a few meters before getting on comms.]

**S-02:** Göndul, I have a bit of an issue. There&#39;s a Volk who won&#39;t move from his post. Can you do something about it or will I need to get my hands dirty?

**S-04:** Nothing some false orders can&#39;t take care of. I&#39;ll change my voice up and call him on his wah... wah..

**S-02:** G-Göndul? Are you alright?

**S-01:** She&#39;s disassociating! Damn it, she&#39;s hemorrhaging!

**S-02:** Do we need to abort the mission? I can be back there in a couple of-

**S-01:**No. You two stay where you are, this is something Göndul has to fix on her own. The only thing we can do is support her while she&#39;s going through this. Göndul can you hear me?

[S-04 groans as she attempts to pull herself up from the digital floor, her vision is blurry but a figure in front of her can be made out. It appears to be a younger version of S-04 before she joined Valravn.]

**Mari:** Wh-where am I? Who are you?

**S-04:** Pl-please don&#39;t panic. If you do, we&#39;ll never wake up. I&#39;m you and you need to come back to me, right now.

**S-02:** Brynhilde! We have a problem. That Volk Guard just radioed Blonko and he&#39;s not responding.

**S-01:** Well someone went and killed him and she needs to fix that situation, pronto.

**S-03:** I&#39;m on it, let me find that damn radio.

**Mari:** Wh-what are you? What happened to our eyes? Who are those people in our ears?

**S-04:** It&#39;s a long story, please don&#39;t freak out. They are our friends.

[S-04 stands up and goes to place her hand on Mari but she recoils from her grasp.]

**Mari:** The memories... what have we done? The people we killed!

**S-01:** Göndul, you&#39;re going into shock! Please say something!

**S-04:** I know you can hear Brynhilde too, I&#39;m the only one you have right now. If this goes on for too long, we split and our body goes numb forever. Take my hand.

**Volk 1:** Blonko respond, I think we have an issue.

[The walkie-crackles to life, S-03 speaks through it.]

**S-03:** (through walkie), This is FSB inspector Polonskaya. The Commandant and I are in the middle of important business. 

**Volk 1:** Business? What kind of business? Your other inspector is lurking where she shouldn&#39;t be. Put the commandant on the line.

**S-04:** Guys, I&#39;m ba- wait who let Sigrun answer the damn walkie! Sigrun, get off of there, I&#39;ll handle this.

[S-04 begins to speak through the walkie in the voice of Commandant Blonko.]

**S-04:** I told you I was not to be disturbed tonight. What are you doing guarding the records room anyways? Slacking off again?

**Volk 1:** No, Commandant. This was the patrol that I was assigned.

**S-04:** Not according to the list here. You should be in the armory.

**Volk 1:** Y-yes sir! 

[The Volk guard walks off down the hallway.]

**S-02:** Perfect. Thank you, Göndul. [S-02 sees S-03 coming from around the corner.] Took you long enough.

**S-03:** I had a date, let me get the door for you.

[S-03 unlocked the door and the pair entered, moving to look through the file cabinets.]

**S-02:** I see that he got you some new clothes. Did he spill his guts to you?

**S-03:** They spilled everywhere but Grigori still eludes me.

**S-02:** A shame. I think I have the documents that we were looking for. Your old pal Grigori&#39;s research notes are in here. [S-02 holds up a few folders in her hands.]

**S-03:** Excellent. Wouldn&#39;t have happened to stumble into anything on the 27th Armored Division[[footnote]] Believed to be the current unit that Grigori Aleksandrovich is attached. [[/footnote]] would you?

**S-02:**  How about their complete personnel list?

**S-03:** Odin shines on you, Herja. Let&#39;s get going before Brynhilde wonders what we&#39;re doing loitering around in here or worse, those Volks decide to pay their commandant a visit.

After obtaining the necessary files from the Volks record room, S-02 and S-03 were able to leave the base unimpeded. They made their way to the mobile command center and were evacuated via helicopter. S-03 was paid extra for the termination of Commandant Blonko who already had an outstanding bounty on his head from a UA official. The relevant documents acquired were delivered to the Tyr Project for analysis and use.

**Aftermath:**  A day after the Sverðmeyja returned to Valkyrie HQ an official statement was given by the Russian Government that Commandant Blonko had died of a heart attack. According to our intelligence services, the Volk Division is unaware of the Sverðmeyja&#39;s involvement, and Valkyrie HQ intends to keep it that way. 

As for the Cognitohazard research that we found, our PR department wants to put it to use in recruiting more girls ages 18-22 into the Valkyrie program using subtle advertisements on social media that would lead them down a path from the Veiled web to our recruitment centers on the Net. As it stands our numbers are few and far between and thus I approve of this method. However, I am a bit concerned that we may get underaged volunteers joining up.

Moving on to the Volks records, we found a lead about a group calling themselves the Soundmagi who potentially have a book in the Set of Nine related to music. R.U.N.N.E.S is running an analysis to determine what exactly is occurring in Poland. Current data suggests there is an 80% likelihood that the anomaly the Soundmagi have is  Set of Nine related.

Overall, the mission was a success, with zero casualties on our side and the enemy taking one. All of the relevant documents were retrieved without issue. The VFR modules provided by Hephaestus&#39;s manual proved effective and were key to our success. environment. This mission also did not allow us to test the extent of our new armor and weapons, but future combat missions should provide us with that data. I do have concerns, however, regarding the health of S-03, and S-04. I will recommend administrative action be taken.

**Freya:** Greetings, Brynhilde. There was something you wished to discuss?

**Brynhilde:** Yes, Dróttning [[footnote]] The commander of the Valkyries. Dróttning is Icelandic for &#34;Queen&#34;.  [[/footnote]] Freya. It&#39;s about two of my Valkyries. S-03 and S-04, Sigrun and Göndul.

**Freya:** What about them?

**Brynhilde:** I would like to request that Sigrun be put on leave for her mental health or at least benched from any more missions involving the Volk Division. As for Göndul, I would like to restrict her time in The Net going forward for future missions.

**Freya:** Denied. Is there anything else?

**Brynhilde:** D-denied? My dróttning, pardon my rudeness but you must reconsider! The mind and bodies of my sisters are at stake here.

**Freya:** Sigrun&#39;s erratic behavior has been considered an acceptable hazard of occupation by the Department of Operations. She has performed above our initial expectations in her recent missions. As for Göndul, she performed admirably, especially under duress.

**Brynhilde:** Yes but-,

**Freya:** But nothing. You forget that their bodies are the property of the Valravn Corporation and it is not up to you to judge how they are used. You all signed away your bodily autonomy when we placed you into those Chassis. As it stands both S-03 and S-04 are extremely profitable units and they can&#39;t be benched in any way.

**Brynhilde:** I understand that, but profit is-

**Freya:** Profit is our game, is it not? Everyone wants Sigrun the Wolf Slayer to perform their assassinations, vengeful queens want their lovers silenced by the raven that pecks out the eyes of lechers. Do you understand? Göndul is the Raven of Cyberspace, the terror of the Net.

They have tragic stories that can be sold. The vengeful orphan gets her vengeance against the monster that killed her family. The former hacker turned a formidable warrior. Clients love them. Marketing is delighted and now that we have those Cognitozhazards you found, we can make Valkyries out of all the impressionable young adults that want to better themselves.  So you will continue to play your role as Squad Leader, Brynhilde. I&#39;m sure you can put up with a bit of insubordination, cleaning up Göndul&#39;s nosebleeds and letting little Sigrun play her game of revenge. Do I make myself clear?

[There is a moment of silence.]

**Brynhilde:** Yes, my dróttning.
