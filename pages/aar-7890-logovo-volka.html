+ After-action Report regarding the raid on a Volk Division base on 20-3-2022 in Russian occupied Transnistria

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;papernote&#34;]]

**Background:** On January 2nd 2022, Valravn Corporation intelligence became aware of a potential asset discovery through a rumor circulating in Bibliomancic circles. Nine anomalous books had appeared in random locations across the globe, the origin of the tomes, dubbed the Set of Nine, is unclear. Corporation Intelligence didn&#39;t have any information about the books besides their existence, until informants confirmed the presence of an anomalous [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6419 |tome]]] in South Africa. Two squads of Jomsvikings[[footnote]] Unaugmented elite foot soldiers of the Valravn Corporation. [[/footnote]] were deployed to the area to retrieve it. The mission was disrupted by a Chaos Insurgency Cell[[footnote]] The cell is believed to be under the command of the PoI known as the Red Scar, wanted by the GOC and SCPF for the theft of eighty known anomalies. [[/footnote]], which resulted in heavy losses for our troops and the loss of the tome.

Afterwards, R.U.N.N.E.S[[footnote]] The Retroactive Unified Neural Network Escathological System (RUNNES) is a powerful predictive system powered by ancient runic magic and artificial intelligence. [[/footnote]] data analysis was used to extrapolate the possible location of the missing tomes. The system analyzed recent Chaos Insurgency activity and  concluded that the South African tome would end up in SCP Foundation custody. With the ceasefire agreement in place, the Valravn could not move to secure the South African tome and thus, the search continued. 

R.U.N.N.E.S pointed to the Eastern Europe theatre where Volk Division mercenaries had been spotted using new Anomalous weaponry whose source could not explained by the usual providers. Coincidentally a local government who was having trouble with the mercenaries hired the Valravn to respond to the threat. Valkyrie HQ deployed the Sverðmeyja to the area to eliminate the Volk and secure any anomalous materials. The Sverðmeyja was successful in their mission, eliminating the Volk presence and securing their book and the weapons cache.

The book [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6952 (code named: Hephaestus&#39;s Manual)] contained a wealth of information on anomalous weapons and armor, that was promptly copied by Valravn R&amp;D. A program was initiated to equip Valravn units with newly acquired prototypes. After concluding that no more useful data could be collected from the tome, the High Table authorized the trade of Hephaestus&#39;s manual with the SCP Foundation in exchange for information on an anomaly of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6755 |interest]]].

The High Table issued orders to gather more information about the origins of The Set of Nine. Information acquired by the Sverðmeyja suggested that anomalous craftsman, [*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-of-the-russian-branch#Lefty Lefty]. could be relevant but no useful information could be obtained from this line. The Volk Division was targeted as the next promising lead. A mission to &#34;Logovo Volka&#34; also known as the Wolves Den, was greenlit. The Wolves Den is located in the Moldovan breakaway state of Transnistria and is believed to hold the Volk Division&#39;s records.

Valkyrie HQ recommended sending the Sverðmeyja due to their experience with the Volk. The Sverðmeyja were promptly given new Chassis and upgraded weaponry derived from the manual. Most notably their armor and bladed weaponry were reforged and recast in Adamantine, a new anomalous metal stronger than carbon steel.

The following are the Sverðmeyja&#39;s profiles. Comprehensive psychological evaluations have been performed in order to ensure the compatibility of the deployed squad for the current mission.

**Real Name:** Vanessa Poltaya 
**Nationality:**  American
**Age:**  30
**Prior combat experience:** U.S Marine Infantry (Four Years), Afghanistan
**Squad Role:** Squad Leader
----

**Background:** Vanessa Poltaya was chosen for the Valkyrie program after suffering grievous injuries from an IED in the Afghanistan&#39;s Kunar Province. Valravn agents monitoring female U.S marines for potential Valkyrie recruits saw an opportunity in the wounded Poltaya who faced the prospect never walking again. Poltaya was given the choice to be given the Valkyrie augmentations or remain disabled for life. Poltaya chose the former.

Poltaya has shown exceptional loyalty to the Valravn Corporation for eight years and her squad of Sverðmeyja is among our best performing units.

**Real Name:** Anja Koski
**Nationality:**  Finnish
**Age:**  35
**Prior combat experience:** Finnish Peacekeeping Forces (six years)
**Squad Role:** Weapons Specialist
----

**Background:** Anja Koski comes from a line with a storied military tradition dating back to the early 1500s. Koski was trained by her father in HEMA[[footnote]] Historical European Martial Arts, the art of swordfighting. [[/footnote]] and is a master level fencer. After serving in the Finnish Peacekeeping Forces as a young woman, she was approached by Valkyrie recruiters who offered a way to increase her combat prowess. She accepted and is the only member of the Sverðmeyja to not join out of disability or personal vendetta. Despite not having the normal psychological profile of a Valkyrie, it was determined that her want to return to the days of martial melee combat on the battlefield would make her a prime candidate of the Valkyrie program.

Koski considers martial prowess the sign of a true warrior and thus eschews firearms and augmented weaponry, preferring to bring her sword into battle. Koski has also taken the youngest member of the Sverðmeyja, Sigrun under her wing and refers to her as &#34;Little Raven&#34;.

**Real Name:** Sofia Lisko
**Nationality:**  Ukrainian
**Age:**  24
**Prior combat experience:** Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces (Two years)
**Squad Role:** Augmented Weapons Specialist/Infiltrator
----

**Background:** Sofia Lisko served as a member of the 21st Territorial Defence Battalion during the War in the Donbass, where she gained combat experience fighting against DPR forces. Two years into the conflict, Sofia came back to her home in Horlivka, only to find that her neighborhood had been raided by members of PMC Wagner group. Her Mother and two sisters had perished at the hands of a unit belonging to Grigori Aleksandrovich, now one of the high ranking members of Volk Division.

Valravn operatives embedded in Ukrainian forces approached Sofia, realizing that we could capitalize on her vulnerability and offered her a spot in the Valkyrie program in order to get her vengeance. Sofia accepted without hesitation.

Now known as Sigrun, she gained a reputation for being one of the most brutal Valkyries in recent memory. She often chooses to inflict grievous wounds using her enhanced abilities rather than going for a quick death when her vengeful side emerges. Valkyrie HQ uses her unique Psychological profile against anomalous groups connected to the Russian government, including Volk Division. Sigrun however does have a history of occasional insubordination, in her hunt for Aleksandrovich but Valkyrie HQ sees this as a necessary compromise to keep her bloodlust sated. This bloodlust has often resulted in her being able to excel beyond the average at completing high risk, long duration missions compared to her sisters in arms.

**Real Name:** Mari Sukumiya
**Nationality:**  Japanese 
**Age:**  25
**Prior combat experience:** None
**Squad Role:** Technical Support
----

**Background:** Mari Sukumiya in her previous life was the considered amongst the upper echelons of Japan&#39;s hacking community. She acted as a &#34;Robin Hood&#34; esque figure, hacking into banking institutions and the wallets of corrupt officials and redistributing the wealth amongst the poor. Due to her abilities, she was initially a candidate for the Cyber-Warfare Division. However, an unexpected turn of events led to a different outcome.

Sukumiya had made an enemy of the Shishi Ryū clan Yakuza who ended up finding her location and blinding her to send a message to those who have their eyes where they shouldn&#39;t. With the orbits of her skull nearly obliterated and unable to continue her hacking work on her own, it was determined that her current psychological profile should fit the Valkyrie program, and thus was offered a spot amongst their ranks. She accepted. Amongst the standard augmentations, facial reconstructive surgery was performed to repair her skull and give her a new set of eyes; allowing her to hack once more.

She was thus assigned to the Sverðmeyja as a cyber warfare operator and tech specialist.


Despite her lack of combat experience, Sukumiya has proven herself to be a capable warrior on the field; utilizing more esoteric augmentations in battle compared to her squadmates as well as drones for recon and target neutralization.

**Incident Overview:**

Preparations for infiltration began with installing VFR[[footnote]] Valravn Facial Reconfiguration. A cognitohazardous augment that shows a chosen face to an onlooker rather than the user&#39;s real face. [[/footnote]] modules in Sigrun and Herja and having them calibrated to their makeshift identities. Sigrun and Herja would be impersonating FSB[[footnote]] Federal Security Bureau, Russian intelligence agency. [[/footnote]] agents who were in for an inspection of the base. Once inside and past any formalities, they were to locate the room, steal the required documents, and leave without causing a stir.

Reconnaissance had mapped out the base&#39;s level of activity throughout the week, and it was determined that on the 20th of March, the base would be at its lowest level of staffing. The 20th thus became the date of the operation. At 17:00, Göndul and Brynhilde setup an observation point about 500 meters from the base to monitor the operation. Göndul was responsible for hacking into Logovo Volka&#39;s systems and looping their camera footage.

Sigrun and Herja arrived at the base at 17:30 where they showed their credentials and asked to be let inside. The IDs provided by the Intel Division proved to withstand scrutiny and the two were allowed inside of the base. They were given a quick tour before being left alone to conduct their inspection.

**S-01:** Sigrun where are you going? The records room is in the other hallway.

**S-03:** I&#39;m taking a little detour to the Commandant&#39;s office. Herja&#39;s got the records room, she&#39;s a big girl.

**S-01:** God damn it, Sigrun! This is no time for your personal vendetta, if you get caught you’ll jeopardize the-

**S-04:** Brynhilde, if I may?

**S-01:** You may speak, Göndul.

**S-04:** I believe Sigrun may have the right idea. The Commandant most likely has keys to the rest of the base and important documents that wouldn&#39;t be left for peering eyes in the records room.

**S-03:** See? That is exactly my plan and if he has information on Grigori, then more the merrier.

**S-01:** (//sighs//) You better be right about this. It&#39;s your head on the chopping block if this fails.

**S-03:** You know my plans always work, now hush. I need to work on my galdur[[footnote]] Icelandic for &#34;Magic&#34;. [[/footnote]].

[S-03 turns to the door and knocks on it.] 

**S-03:** Maria Polonskaya, FSB inspector. Commandant, we need to talk.

**Commandant:** You may enter.

[S-03 enters the room to find the commandant writing papers at his desk. The room is a modest looking office space with one defining feature that Sigrun focuses on for five seconds is the safe on the left.]

**S-03:** Oh. My. Goodness. [Sigrun&#39;s optical sensors run facial ID to determine the man is Commandant Mikhail Blonko, an associate of Grigori A.] You must be the great Commandant Blonko, I&#39;ve heard so much about you!

**Commandant:** Please, Inspector Polonskaya, you flatter me.

**S-03:** I mean it. I just have to ask for security reasons, is this room soundproof? Don&#39;t want any classified information getting out.

**Commandant:** Do not worry, inspector. This room is wholly soundproof. Now I wasn&#39;t exactly expecting an FSB inspection so late at night. What brings you to our base?

**S-03:** Well as you know we&#39;ve had to move more and more of our troops from Transnistria for other operations and had to rely increasingly on the Volk Division for security. My boss wanted to make sure that any operation security hadn&#39;t been compromised.

[S-03 approaches the front of the table and the Commandant proceeds to wrap an arm around her waist.]

**Commandant:** I can assure you that everything is secure. Let&#39;s set business aside if you don&#39;t mind. If you&#39;re looking to get a promotion, I might be able to help with that.

**S-03:** Oh, Commandant! 

[S-03 slides herself onto his seat, straddling him.]

**S-03:** I must admit this trip was just an excuse to see you.

**Commandant:** I&#39;m glad that I have fans, now let&#39;s get you out of this stuffy coat.

[The Commandant attempts to raise a hand to S-03 but she grabs his wrist and a loud crunching is heard. She is believed to have shattered his wrist. The Commandant screams and S-03 rears and arm back before driving her Adamantine wrist blade into his abdomen]

**S-03:** Scream all you want you rabid dog. No one will hear you.

**Commandant:** You bitch! Why are you doing this!?

**S-03:** This is for what you did in Horlivka, do you remember the women you killed?

**Commandant:** You&#39;ll have to be more specific, we killed a lot of guerillas that days.

**S-03:** Guerillas? They were my family, you orcish swine! 

[S-03 withdraws her arm and stabs him with the blade again.]

**S-03:** Where is Grigori? I&#39;m not asking again!

**The Commandant:** Agh! Fuck you bitch! I&#39;m not telling you anything!

[S-03 grabs his other hand and proceeds to crush it in her grasp, fingers are bent in unnatural angles and loud crunching is heard]

**S-03:** I&#39;ll keep breaking as many bones as I need to you mangy dog! You&#39;ll feel every bit of pain my family felt, little by little....

[Further interrogation removed for brevity.]

**S-03:** Brynhilde, I have his keycard. I saw a safe in here when I entered. Moving to check it now.

**S-01:** And the Commandant?

[S-03 drags the remains of his body from the chair and over into a nearby closet]

**S-03:** He was nice enough to let me test out these new Adamantine blades. They cut through bone and flesh like it&#39;s nothing.

**S-01:** Odin&#39;s beard, Sigrun.

**S-03:** Relax, I&#39;m hiding the body and locking the room shut. Nobody&#39;s getting in here for a few hours and we&#39;ll be long gone by then.

[S-03 places the body inside the closet and moves over to the Safe. She slides the keycard into the pad and the box opens without issue. She removes a small slip of paper with a URL on it that reads [POTENTIAL MEMETIC HAZARD EXPUNGED].]

**S-03:** I found a.... website? Leads to a file of some sort.

**S-04:** Interesting. Hold onto it for now. I&#39;ll access it once we&#39;re out here. Anything else?

**S-03:** Strangely, no. Just the slip. I need to use his washroom and raid his closet a bit. I&#39;m covered in blood. Once I&#39;m presentable I will rendezvous with Herja. Sigrun, out.

**S-02:** Brynhilde, I&#39;m approaching the records room now.

**S-01:** Affirmative. Keep me posted on your status. Also do you mind telling me why you let Sigrun go off on her own to potentially jeopardize our mission?

**S-02:** Little Raven needs a little more blood on her ledger if she&#39;s to get to Valhalla. I thought at least you could understand that.

**S-01:** I understand that but she needs to let this whole Grigori thing go. She&#39;s been getting reckless and it&#39;s going to get us all killed.

**S-02:** I&#39;d gladly die fighting the Skíthælar[[footnote]] Icelandic for bastards. [[/footnote]] who took her family away from her. [S-02 stops before turning the corner, a Volk Mercenary appears once her vision turns to X-Ray/Thermals] We&#39;ll talk about this later, I am here.

[S-02 walks out to the soldier guarding the records room.]

**S-02:** Comrade. [She pulls out her badge.] Valentina Vostok, FSB. I&#39;m going to need to see your records room.

**Volk 1:** Your accent is a little strange, FSB woman. But even if that badge checks out, I&#39;ve been instructed not to let anyone through. There is very sensitive information in here and you should probably just keep walking.

**S-02:** I have a bit of a cough, thank you very much. Secondly, you deny an agent of the FSB access to your records? What are you hiding in there?

**Volk 1:** Look ma&#39;am, I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re Vladimir Putin himself. You can take it up with the Commandant, if you don&#39;t like it.

**S-02:** He&#39;s a little preoccupied at the moment. Please I&#39;ll just be a moment.

**Volk 1:** Keep moving ma&#39;am.

**S-02:** Fine. I&#39;ll keep walking.

[S-02 walks away a few meters from the guard before removing her adamantine knife from her coat pocket, turning around and throwing it into the man&#39;s skull. She approaches him as blood begins to pool on the floor, the knife was impaled all the way through his temporal bone. S-02 removes the knife and a handkerchief from her pocket and begins to clean the knife.]

**S-02:** A wonderful thing this Adamantine is. [S-02 looks up and sees no one in the room ahead. She grabs the keys from the man and opens the door, dragging him inside.] Brynhilde, I&#39;m inside. Anything in particular to look out for?

**S-01:** Well done, Herja. We&#39;re looking for anything on those anomalous books. If they are organized Alphabetically, try H for Hephaestus. Or I for Izanami.

**S-02:** Can do. I&#39;ll get to looking. 

[S-02 drags the body to a nearby table, placing it underneath. S-02 then proceeds to look through the various filing cabinets. This activity continues for a few minutes until S-03&#39;s voice is heard on comms.]

**S-03:** Herja, I&#39;m almost to the records room. Expect me in less than a minute.

**S-02:** I take it your date with the Commandant went well?

[The door to the room opens and S-02 peers over to see S-03 in new clothes.]

**S-02:** New clothes? He must have spilled his guts then.

**S-03:** They spilled everywhere but Grigori still eludes me.

**S-02:** A shame. I think I have the requisite documents that we were looking for. Your old pal Grigori&#39;s research notes are in here. [S-02 holds up a few folders in her hands.]

**S-03:** Excellent. Wouldn&#39;t have happened to stumble into anything on the 27th Armored Division[[footnote]] Believed to be the current unit that Grigori Aleksandrovich is attached to. [[/footnote]] would you?

**S-02:**  How about their complete personnel list?

**S-03:** Odin shines on you, Herja. Let&#39;s get going before Brynhilde wonders what we&#39;re doing loitering around in here or worse, those Volks decide to pay their commandant a visit.

After obtaining the necessary files from the Volk&#39;s record room, Sigrun and Herja left the way they came in. The convoy that delivered them took them into the woods where they rendezvoused with the rest of the squad. The relevant documents were delivered to Valkyrie HQ and the slip of paper was kept by Göndul for analysis. 

The following notes were acquired from Logovo Volka, anything relating to Volk Division troop movements and placements has been omitted for relevance.

----
Efforts to locate the Author of Hephaestus&#39;s manual have been less than successful. We became aware of the Set when I visited Lefty in St. Petersburg and I purchased the manual from him. He had said that he&#39;d found it buried about a few hundred meters from his house in the snow. Given it&#39;s anomalous properties, I&#39;m within my mind to say that it was left for Lefty himself. Judging by what we know of the rumored properties of other books in the set, we can only assume they must to be an incredibly gifted thaumaturge with extensive anomalous knowledge in order to write these books.

If you ask me, I believe this to be the work of the Serpent&#39;s Hand and their damnable library but I&#39;ve heard other theories. Perhaps they studied at Alexylva or at the Medicean Academy. Another possibility is that they may belong to those Sarkic fellows, The Hunter&#39;s Black Lodge. They do operate close to where Lefty found the book originally.

Regardless of the Author&#39;s affiliation, the ones bankrolling us want them captured and as long as they&#39;re paying, we&#39;ll keep looking.. - Grigori Aleksandrovich

In addition to Hephaestus&#39;s manual, we know of a few more books that have made their presence known. Our sources close the Chaos Insurgency informed of us of the book known as the Izanami&#39;s Grimoire, although it is currently inaccessible to us.

Another was given to us in the form of a URL to a PDF hosted on an untraceable server. This PDF contains a wealth of potentially weaponizable memetic hazards. We aren&#39;t sure how many people accessed the URL or if the hazards have been disseminated but we believe that they would be perfect for our propaganda wing.

Finally we received intelligence of a group of Soundmagi massing in Poland to listen to &#34;The world&#39;s greatest symphony, with pieces performed from Bragi&#39;s 1000 Symphonies &#34;. This seems in line with the titles of the other books in the series but this will need to be independently verified. - Grigori Aleksandrovich

The 2nd Thaumaturgical brigade had made a discovery from doing an ontological analysis of Hephaestus&#39;s manual. It appears that the book has a hex cast upon it that is designed to react with eight other objects carrying a similar hex on them. One could only assume that if all of the books were assembled, something would occur. As of right now Volk Division has yet to acquire another of the Set so this theory cannot be proven as of yet.

The question however remains, why was were the books seperated in the first place if they were made to do something once assembled? Could they have been stolen from their original creator? Or are they playing some elaborate game? - Grigori Aleksandrovich.

**Aftermath:**  A day after the Sverðmeyja returned to Valkyrie HQ an official statement was given by the Russian Government that local partisans had assassinated Commandant Blonko and caused the death of another Volk mercenary. According to our intelligence services, the Volk are still unaware of the Sverðmeyja&#39;s existence, which Valkyrie HQ intends to keep it that way. Unfortunately for us, the URL we found led to a blank page. The PDF in question had been scrubbed and that server was no longer functional. It is believed that the SCP Foundation may have been responsible but as of right now it cannot be confirmed.

As for the lead regarding the Soundmagi, R.U.N.N.E.S is running an analysis to determine what exactly is occurring in Poland. Current data suggest a 80% likelihood the Poland event is Set of Nine related.

Overall, the mission was a success, with zero casualties on our side and the enemy taking two. All of the relevant documents retrieved without issue. The upgrades provided by Hephaestus&#39;s manual proved effective in eliminating human targets in a stealth environment. Further field experience is needed to determine how well they perform against anomalous targets. This mission also did not allow us to test the extent of our new armor, but future combat missions should provide us with that data. I do have concerns however, regarding the mental health of S-03 and will be recommending administrative action be taken.

**Freya:** Greetings, Brynhilde. There was something you wished to discuss.

**Brynhilde:** Yes, Dróttning [[footnote]] The commander of the Valkyries. Dróttning is Icelandic for &#34;Queen&#34;.  [[/footnote]] Freya. It&#39;s about one of my Valkyries. S-03, Sigrun.

**Freya:** What about Sigrun?

**Brynhilde:** I would like to request that she be put on leave for her mental health or at least benched from anymore missions involving the Volk Division.

**Freya:** Denied. Is there anything else?

**Brynhilde:** D-denied? My dróttning, pardon my rudeness but you must reconsider! I know the Valkyries selected Sigrun to use her rage against our enemies in Eastern Europe, but this has gone on for too long! She&#39;s insubordinate and getting increasingly violent. You saw that footage, she&#39;s unhinged and she&#39;s going to get herself killed.

**Freya:** Sigrun&#39;s erratic behavior has been considered an acceptable hazard of occupation by the Department of Operations. Sigrun has performed above our initial expectations in her recent missions. Are you aware that we were contacted about what happened at Logovo Volka?

**Brynhilde:** No but-

**Freya:** Russian misinformation was never going to hide what had happened there. Our customer base knew that one of our Valkyries did the deed and when we sent them the footage they offered to double our usual asking rate.

**Brynhilde:** That&#39;s great but profit is-

**Freya:** Profit is our game, is it not? Everyone wants Sigrun the Wolf Slayer to perform their assassinations, vengeful queens want their lovers silenced by the raven that pecks out the eyes of lechers. Do you understand? Sigrun is not to go on leave. Sigrun&#39;s rage is only to be channeled as a hammer to strike our targets with extreme prejudice. The tale of a rogue vengeful orphan getting her vengeance against the monster that killed her family is just too good of a sales pitch to be ignored. Clients love her. Marketing is delighted. She is our little child star. The more money we rake in, the more resources our division gets. So you will continue to play your role as Squad Leader, Brynhilde. I&#39;m sure you can put up with a bit of insubordination and let little Sigrun play her game of revenge. Do I make myself clear?

**Brynhilde:** Yes, my dróttning.
