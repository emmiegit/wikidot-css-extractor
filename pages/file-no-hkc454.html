__Current Situation of Anomalous Vietnamese Boat People[[footnote]]Note from RAISA: Since the 70s, Hong Kong started to receive Vietnam War refugees from both North and South Vietnam.[[/footnote]]__
[[/=]]
The following are the content and course of action of the policy for anomalous entities among Vietnamese boat people:

[[=]]
SITUATION
[[/=]]
----
Firstly, there is an increasing trend in the illegal immigration of anomalous entities. It has been shown 0.032% of migrants have anomalous effects, and of these, 78% understand their own effects. This huge influx overwhelmed Team Zero&#39;s detention room. Therefore, a temporary detention centre is needed for the containment of the anomalous entities.

Secondly, some of the boat people have been affected by the anomaly. Another location is needed to find for their medical treatment and nursing under veil doctrine. According to the MI666 obtained record, [[[scp-2350|the paramilitary branch of the USA Department of Defense (code name: Pentagram) had used weaponized memetic agent in Vietnam War.]]] and the British government signed the Geneva Convention that Hong Kong is appointed by UNHCR as Port of First Asylum and responsible for the related medical treatment. [[footnote]]Note from RAISA: See Global Occult Coalition&#39;s annex for detail.[[/footnote]]Since the treatment involved paratech, the custodial wards for these patients are needed to separate from the regular custodial wards and public hospital wards.

Until now, there have already been 3 cases of anomalous effects that occurred in the detention centre, while the deployed CSD[[footnote]]Note from RAISA: Correctional Services Department, former named &#34;Prisons Department&#34;, which responsible for managing the detention centre for the Vietnamese migrant in the British administration.[[/footnote]] staffs have no awareness of anomalies. As a result, 5 CSD staff have already died in the line of duty. At the same time, these incidents also cause disruptive situations in the confined living condition of detention centres, which lead to a total of 16 boat people being injured.

With the influx of Vietnamese boat people, the above three situations directly affecting Hong Kong correctional services, public security and veil doctrine therefore need to be handled immediately.

[[=]]
POLICIES
----
[[/=]]
1. Approved Team Zero to allocate 20 (including informal members) to organize a task force to evaluate related issues.

2. Building temporary detention centres.

3. Develop a quick test for identifying anomalous humanoids.

Regarding the Implementation of the Policies
[[/=]]
To encounter more and more serious Vietnamese boat people issues, three instruction is proposed by Special Branch. The following is the detail of the practical implementation:

__Temporary Detention Centre:__

[[[new-cha-ling|At present, site selection of the temporary detention centre is located in New Cha Ling.]]] In addition to resembling the design of the ordinary detention centre[[footnote]]Note from RAISA: At that time the communities responsible for hosting Vietnamese boat people, for example, Tai A Chau Detention Centre for Vietnamese migrants.[[/footnote]] with public bathhouses, office and detention quarters, there are 20 special custodial wards. In addition, activity rooms for religious activities will be built in order to account for the potential special religious needs of the relevant abnormal communities which boat people need to apply for it every single use.

The whole detention centre would be covered by a mini-type Scranton Reality Matrix, and there are miniature type Kant counters attached in the office. It is estimated the construction will complete in half a year, there will be able to accommodate up to 100 boat people waiting to be repatriated or transferred to other countries.

__Extrastaff Recruitment:__

20 staff are recruited from the police force and CSD and completed three months of abnormal community and response training. This personnel have entered two months internship, it is estimated they can finish the internship before the centre construction completes and put into service officially.

__Rapid Test on Anomalous Humanoid:__

Though the internal application of paratech is effective currently, further research and retrofit are rather uncommon. Therefore, the research is currently contracted to Prometheus Labs. However, the bottleneck is encountered and further funding is required. Please refer to Addendum 1 for details.

Hi,

As approved in an outsourcing contract with us, a scientific research company, we carried out technological research, in order to achieve memetic transmission through broadcasting towards the boat people, and at least to screen the Vietnamese boat people intending to conceal their special situation. After the tireless efforts of our employees, the memetic audio developed has passed the trial successfully: Listener would develop some harmless red rashes on the body, and these rashes would remain on the entity for approximately 10 to 20 days.

However, the production of radio is extremely complicated. Since the memetic effect is spread indirectly through the radio rather than to the radio itself, both rerecording and copying of the radio cannot inherit the prototype’s effect. On the other hand, the preparation of embedding the memetic effect into the radio already takes three to four months in the current funding situation, which is not enough for a mass broadcast by the marine police.

As our contract expires in January of next year, the test version has been sent to the police station. If it is necessary to develop a version with reproducible effects, it is suggested a further investment into the projects to facilitate the operation of the R&amp;D team in the future.
[[/div]]

&gt; The related funding was approved by MI666.

After a long period of effort, mixing and editing of the memetic effect and audio is finally done. It now works even in the radio broadcast.

50 copies have been prepared. Please contact us if more are needed.

I&#39;m looking forward to working together next time.

&gt; Since 1988, the 44s-length recording of &#34;Comprehensive Plan of Action for Vietnamese boat people&#34;[[footnote]]Note from RAISA: known as &#39;Bat lau dung laai&#39; (//Translator&#39;s Note:// Transliteration from Cantonese &#34;不漏洞拉&#34; which is mishearing of Vietnamese &#34;bắt đầu từ nay&#34; mean &#34;start for now&#34;.), broadcasted after the 10 pm Evening News between 1988 to 1997.[[/footnote]] broadcasts through radio with the humanoid entity screening meme. However, the effect is unsatisfactory with an encounter rate of about 38%. The audio will keep broadcasting while the alternative solution is developing. [[footnote]]Note from researcher Zhang Daoshi: There is no memetic effect in the rerecording audio found on the internet, the investigation for the original is ongoing.[[/footnote]]
