**Item #:** SCP-7774

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Saint Mary&#39;s Catholic Cemetery is to be inspected for upkeep every first Sunday of a new month. Janitorial personnel are to be dispatched on site for landscaping purposes.

Once per year, the cemetery is to be closed to the public seventy-two hours leading to the date of June 12th under the guise of maintenance purposes. Twenty-four hours preceding June 12th, the area surrounding SCP-7774 will be blocked from public access via MTF unit Kappa-16 //(Groundskeepers)//.

**Description:** SCP-7774 is a yearly phenomenon affecting the area of Fredericksburg, Texas. On June 12th, uniquely at 6:30 AM (CST) precisely, SCP-7774 will animate as a humanoid structure, typically a sculpture, within the surrounding area. From discovery, SCP-7774 has indicated a preference for using the form of an angel statue within Saint Mary&#39;s Cemetery.

Upon animation, the often preferred[[footnote]]Previous experimentation surrounding the removal of structures within Fredericksburg has yielded varying activation locations, yet prevention of SCP-7774 from manifesting has been unsuccessful.[[/footnote]] angel statue of SCP-7774 has been displayed to step from its pedestal, manifesting lithe control over the statue&#39;s stone limbs. Passive, non-verbal acknowledgement of Foundation personnel has been previously observed.

Often following a brief stroll of the cemetery, SCP-7774 will spend the remainder of the phenomenon in close proximity to a faded, marble cross grave. Observed behavior of SCP-7774 has previously revealed the anomaly:

* Kneeling, bowing, or praying over the grave-site
* Gently caressing the ground
* Weaving nearby flowers into bouquets (sunflowers, bluebonnets, pink evening primrose, etc.)

In the evening, commonly after 7:00 PM, SCP-7774 will stand up from the grave after making a final gesture and will return to the statue&#39;s initial location, reverting to a non-anomalous state.

Local rumors of angels blessing the graves of Saint Mary&#39;s began to spread in Fredericksburg by local citizens as early as June of 1974. Monthly low priority surveillance of the cemetery was conducted for over a year before SCP-7774 was discovered.

Upon scheduled retrieval, SCP-7774 was discovered to be kneeling over its chosen grave-site. Local foundation personnel dispatched to the area attempted to secure SCP-7774 away from the site to find SCP-7774 having demanifested, leaving a common, non-anomalous angel statue.

Excavation of the grave SCP-7774 was discovered upon revealed the following:
* One decayed human skeleton of a juvenile female
* One wooden rosary, broken into two parts
* One faded photograph of a woman and young child

Restoration of the photograph revealed faint handwriting on the back. Analysis of the photograph revealed the text &#34;Judith, 6-12.&#34;

Following discovery, the grave site was returned to its original state. Foundation personnel were planted as groundskeepers within Saint Mary&#39;s Cemetery for quick surveillance for future SCP-7774 instances.
