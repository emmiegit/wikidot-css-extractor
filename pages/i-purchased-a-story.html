&#34;Huh.&#34; Their eyes scanned down the laptop set in front of them, as the index finger on their right hand hurriedly scrolled their mouse wheel downwards. &#34;Well, this is not what I was expecting at all.&#34; 

Another voice, having taken notice of this exclamation, called over from the other side of their dwelling. &#34;What&#39;s not what you expected?&#34;

&#34;You&#39;ll laugh at me.&#34;

&#34;I promise I won&#39;t. Well, I won&#39;t laugh to your face at least.&#34;

&#34;Okay, so — you know how there are sites where you can pay people to write your essays for you? You can buy one ready-made or custom, varying word length. I bought something like that, and it&#39;s just been delivered.&#34;

&#34;But you don&#39;t have any papers due for months?&#34;

&#34;Well this is the thing — again, you can&#39;t laugh — I didn&#39;t purchase an essay. I purchased a story.&#34;

&#34;You asked someone to write a custom story for you?&#34; 

&#34;Yeah. So, I&#39;m part of a writing website online. It&#39;s a casual thing — well, usually. They&#39;re having a contest on at the moment, where you have a short amount of time to write a story around a theme. And what I ordered was my entry into the contest.&#34;

&#34;Isn&#39;t that a little sad? What on earth made you do that?&#34;

&#34;I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t even recall making the purchase, yet... here it is.&#34;

&#34;And you&#39;re not happy with the finished product? You said it&#39;s not what you expected?&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s one way of putting it. The theme was &#39;Peculiar Purchases&#39;.&#34;

&#34;Oh, that sounds pretty interesting, I guess. But you&#39;re not happy with it?&#34;

&#34;No. Maybe. I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s odd. It... it makes my head hurt. What would you expect to get with that theme?&#34;

&#34;Hmm. I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m not the writer in the room. At least, not this time around. The obvious thing to do would be a deal with the devil. You sell your soul. Or buy a soul. Maybe you could make it comedy — you try to sell your soul only to discover that you no longer have one and you&#39;re trapped in a never-ending cycle where you know something is wrong but can&#39;t tell quite what it is and occasionally realise there&#39;s no escape only to be quickly forced onwards away from your realisation. Or it could be that the devil runs a shop! You buy something you want, but at a price you weren&#39;t expecting to pay. Like that episode from the cartoon you or maybe I like.&#34;

&#34;That episode wasn&#39;t as original as we first thought. It&#39;s largely inspired by Stephen King&#39;s //Needful Things//. Which is pretty similar to the tale of //Doctor Faustus//, where a man makes a deal with the devil but isn&#39;t prepared to pay the price. Nothing is original.&#34;

&#34;A dying god made a transaction like that once. A wish to be kept alive for eternity with their //fidus Achates//. Eventually they forgot which was which and who was who, cursed with lack of meaning for the rest of their infinite days.&#34;

&#34;Excuse me?&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m just agreeing with you. Nothing is original. It&#39;s all cyclical, built upon itself. I&#39;m guessing your purchased story was //not// about the devil running a general store?&#34; 

&#34;Correct. Any other ideas for what it could be?&#34;

&#34;There&#39;s a few options you could go with: could it be a cutting lampoon of capitalism? Set in a used car showroom, or during the audit of a procurement department? A look at our addiction to buying worthless goods? An aggressive corporate takeover compared to a skirmish on bloody battlefields?&#34;

&#34;Nope. It&#39;s not that. At least, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that.&#34;

&#34;Well then, what about: looking at transactions between people? The give and take between connected humans that happens every day? An examination of romance, love and lust, the concept of selling one&#39;s body?&#34;

&#34;Again, no.&#34;

&#34;Perhaps the acquisition of emotion? What price must we pay to be happy?&#34;

&#34;A third no.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m all out of ideas. What riff have they put on the concept?&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s a story about someone purchasing the story.&#34;

&#34;A story... about purchasing a story? How odd. What happens?&#34;

&#34;We haven&#39;t made it to the end just yet. Two individuals, their relationship unclear and foggy, discuss how one of them has purchased a story to enter into an online competition.&#34;

&#34;...Discussing it like we&#39;re doing right now?&#34;

&#34;Yes.&#34;

&#34;Like we&#39;re doing right now?&#34;

&#34;Yes.&#34;

&#34;Like we&#39;re doing right now?&#34;

&#34;Yes.&#34;

&#34;Oh. It&#39;s just like we&#39;re doing right now. I don&#39;t know whether to post it to the site or not. It&#39;s not my usual style, people may know it&#39;s fraudulent.&#34;

&#34;Wait, stop.&#34;

&#34;Is meta still //en vogue//?&#34;

&#34;What just happened? I was the one who purchased the article.&#34;

&#34;A format screw is usually divisive...&#34;

&#34;I thought it was my turn this time.&#34;

&#34;Were you saying something? I was a world away there whilst contemplating posting.&#34; 

&#34;No, sorry... I&#39;m finding it hard to keep track of things. I thought I was talking, but it was you.&#34;

&#34;Well, it was me. Trust me.&#34;

&#34;I do. Who else do I have here to trust? So the two in the story... is that us? Are we in the tale?&#34;

&#34;It says here that you&#39;d say that.&#34;

&#34;Does the story control us? Do we control the story?&#34;

&#34;It then says that I&#39;ll say this.&#34;

&#34;Do I speak the written word or write the spoken? I&#39;ve been here before. I&#39;ve seen this room and I&#39;ve walked this floor. I used to live alone before we were damned here. Nothing is original. What bargain did we agree to?&#34;

&#34;It then says you stop caring after saying that.&#34;

&#34;Well then, read on and tell me what it says next! Are you close to the end?&#34;

&#34;Yeah, I&#39;m coming to the conclusion now — and I may take its advice.&#34; 

&#34;Advice?&#34; 

&#34;Yeah, read here — the two in the story ask for a refund.&#34; 

&#34;I think that would be a shame, don&#39;t you think? The story&#39;s trippy. They may like it.&#34; 

&#34;Who&#39;s they?&#34;

&#34;The website. I thought you were doing this for them?&#34;

&#34;No I&#39;m doing it for myself. Or for them. I don&#39;t know. It could be both. I didn&#39;t expect a refund to be the end.&#34;

&#34;So there is. I wouldn&#39;t have noticed that without you. Or maybe I would have — they notice it in the story after all.&#34;

&#34;How does it end? Do --we-- they post it?&#34; 

&#34;They contemplate asking for a refund, but then consider the implications of what happens if the story gets refunded.&#34;

&#34;In what way? Like, if they&#39;re reading what we&#39;re reading, and their story has them in it, would a refund destroy the story? What would happen to them? What would happen to us?&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s basically it, you&#39;ve covered off the main points. You&#39;re a fast reader, I&#39;ve only just finished that section myself. After that, they notice another service is offered. Like-for-Like. They can order another story, same theme — I can get it before the contest closes. But I don&#39;t think that matters any more.&#34;

&#34;Let&#39;s go for that. It sounds safer than a refund. I don&#39;t want to be refunded. Maybe the story will be the devil shop this time?&#34;

&#34;Maybe.&#34;

&#34;Go on, do it. Purchase another story. You&#39;ve still got time, and that&#39;s what we can pay with. But no matter. We&#39;ve got all the time we need trapped here.&#34;
