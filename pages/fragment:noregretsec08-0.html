I walk through Site-02, the tapping of my shoes echoing through the empty halls. The air is warm and damp, and I can feel the fabric of my dress shirt begin to stick to my skin. Frustrated and impatient, I continue to wander the halls until I find a strange, unmarked double door that stands out amongst the rest.

I take out my keycard labeled **Ethics Committee Member — 08** and press it to the keycard scanner as it makes a happy chime. The scanner turns green, and the door makes a loud clicking sound. I look around me, left and right, seeing the empty corridors and their blinding overhead lights.

I&#39;m alone. 

I grab the handle and pull the door open, letting the light from the hall pierce the darkness that tries to cower in the corners of the room. In the middle of the room was a metal cabinet desk, lit only by a sole ceiling light hanging above. I enter and close the door behind me, hearing the door click and lock shut. 

I&#39;m not alone. 

I look towards the camera that&#39;s attached in the top right corner of the dimly lit room, staring at me. Its lenses focus on my face, scanning and storing my faceprint. They would know I was here. I look across the dark room and see several offline sentries standing at parade rest. I can&#39;t even imagine how many interns lost their lives accidentally stumbling in here. I walk to the desk and sit in the chair, seeing the lockbox, a folder, and a computer terminal gathering dust. The folder piqued my interest immediately, its contents marred by numerous redactions. I could hear my shallow breaths stagger as I rifle through the documents, my eyes darting through, skimming the contents before moving on to the next page. 

My curiosity tempted me even further. 

I put the folder down, as it didn&#39;t contain anything of use to me, and stared at the dusty LED screen of the terminal. I reach into my suit pocket and grab a small rag as I wipe the screen. Once I was done, I began to fold it, but I hesitated and threw it onto the floor. It&#39;s too dirty to put it back in my pocket. 

I raise my finger towards the terminal and press the blinking power button. The screen flickers and whirs to life, showing me the oh-so-familiar logo...

**Item #:** SCP-7306

**Object Class:** Safe 

**Special Containment Procedures**: As of 10/03/2023, SCP-7306&#39;s containment procedures have been updated. No Foundation personnel, except for the O5 Council and the Ethics Committee, are to know of the existence of SCP-7306. The Director of Site-02 is to be informed of the containment procedures of SCP-7306 but not its descriptive function to reduce information leaks. All documents, digital or physical, are to be stored in SCP-7306&#39;s storage unit and never displaced from the room. 

SCP-7306 is to be contained in an unmarked private storage unit at Site-02. Multiple targeting systems and devices scanning the room controlled via Site-02&#39;s A.I. system have been installed for security purposes. Due to previous incidents, no other Foundation or site personnel are to test or use SCP-7306 for any reason. 

Continuous utilization of SCP-7306 will cause rapid mental deterioration and will require psychological evaluation and therapy. It is recommended any future use of SCP-7306 is limited to one use to avoid **[DATA EXPUNGED]**. 

**Description:** SCP-7306 is a blank, pristine polaroid film with no distinctive identifying marks, that is impossible to be damaged or destroyed. It exhibits no visual anomalous properties until held by a human subject with average memory retention and mental acuity. The blank image is then slowly replaced by an image the subject is familiar with, usually a prevalent moment in the subject&#39;s life. 

Once the image has been fully colorized in the film, the subject will be unresponsive to any interaction or communication for a short period of time. Their consciousness will then transfer to the time period to which they have traveled and experience a duration ranging from one to twenty-four (1-24) hours before their consciousness spontaneously returns to their physical body. After said subjects&#39; consciousness returns, opening SCP-7306-2 will reveal a new polaroid film (-A to -G), containing no anomalous properties, capturing a random moment the subject was photographed as well as a new entry in the journal found in SCP-7306-2. 

SCP-7306-2 is a small steel lock box that contains SCP-7306-A to -G, a photographer&#39;s journal, several used pencils that are utilized each time SCP-7306 is activated, and a replacement lens for a polaroid camera. The journal describes events that SCP-7306-3, the photographer, has photographed and logged. It is unknown if the photographer has written down the interaction in the journal as a warning or if the journal itself is the anomaly manipulating spacetime. 

SCP-7306-3 is a Caucasian male; records indicate his name to be Pater Beard, a famous photographer who has been missing since 2020 and was found dead in Camp Hero State Park. No other information of the photographer, SCP-7306-3, is known at this time. [[size 18%]]lies[[/size]]

**Summary**: SCP-7306-2 was found in Montauk, Long Island, on Pater Beard’s (MIA) property and was immediately recovered when his family reported his wife found a strange lockbox that gave her vivid dreams of her late husband. All witnesses were interviewed and were given amnestics shortly after object retrieval. The following is an audio log recorded during the execution of Operation &#34;Tag and Bag&#34;, conducted by Mobile Task Force Epsilon-6 (&#34;Village Idiots&#34;) with interference from Gamma-5 (&#34;Red Herrings&#34;).

**##90162D|Experiment 1##** — &#34;The Soldier&#34;

**Subject**: //Subject #D82718//, Afghanistan War veteran, age twenty-nine (29). Convicted of armed robbery and homicide of law enforcement officers and mutable counts of 2nd-degree homicide. Caucasian, only child with two (2) married parents. 

**Result**: Subject #D82718 used SCP-7306 and was in a state of shock for an estimated 7 seconds. After the subject returned, they were unresponsive for 2 days. They recalled being back in Afghanistan, where he previously failed to save his former squad mate from oncoming fire from enemy forces. They attempted to save his former squad mate but ended up failing again. The subject requested to use SCP-7306 a second time but was denied and reassigned to regular duties.

**Subject**: Amir Bugti, a current college student at Harvard University, age twenty-one (21). Pakistani, no siblings, and two (2) married parents. 

**Result**: Subject used SCP-7306 and was in a state of shock for an estimated 4 seconds. After returning, they were immediately responsive and cooperative with Foundation staff. They recalled being back on campus where he was shortly asked if he would like to go to a party hosted by the unofficial ασʊ fraternity. They noted he declined the offer previously but accepted it in this case due to regretting not being involved in &#34;college activities&#34;. He remembered inviting a few of his friends to party and relax after Friday classes. Upon looking at his record, it is shown he was arrested for simple possession of small quantities of illegal drugs as well as drug-induced homicide. Three out of five individuals who were present during that time overdosed and died before paramedics could arrive. Campus police caught and detained Amir Bugti, charging him and those who rented the property. When the subject was informed of what he did, he refused to believe the Foundation staff. Staff then ended the experiment and returned him to MCI-Cedar Junction //(Note: Subject was __not__ charged prior to using SCP-7306)//.

**Subject**: Mitch Kang, Security Chief for Site-02, age forty-three (43). Asian, no children or spouse. 

**Result**: On 09-02-2023, Security Chief Mitch Kang was found frantically sobbing and shaking in SCP-7306’s previous containment chamber for a long period of time. Once calmed down, they were questioned and put into quarantine for further analysis. During further investigation, Security Officer Mitch Kang admitted to working as an informant for multiple hostile factions towards The Foundation, most prominently the Chaos Insurgency. His actions led to the breach in containment of many SCP subjects which caused a K-Class scenario. In an effort to reverse the situation and danger he put himself in, he used SCP-7306 on his own accord.

**Result**: Subject used SCP-7306 and was in a state of shock for an estimated 9 seconds. They were unresponsive for an estimated 11 hours. During the interview, the subject recalled being on duty and walking to his appointed terminal. He then received a familiar call from his ex-wife, telling him their sixteen-year-old child was robbed and then stabbed on the way home from school. They immediately ran towards the nearest available vehicle and left for the hospital where she was being treated. When they were told what he had done previously, he mentioned remaining on duty and continuing his flight. He noted,&#34; This didn&#39;t change anything. This put fire to a once-dying memory.&#34;

**Note**: On 9/19/2023, shortly after Experiment 17, the Ethics Committee ordered all research and tests with SCP-7306 to be canceled, and the research team led by Dr. Michael Olson disbanded and dispersed to other Foundation projects. Due to the unethical consequences SCP-7306 brings, SCP-7306 is to remain in its containment chamber, and no Site-02 personnel, specifically research personnel, are allowed inside.

**Summary**: On 10/03/2023, Senior Researcher Michael Olson, Assistant Researcher Kyle Jacobson, Assistant Researcher Brooke Bayfield, and several other Site-02 staff were discovered to have used SCP-7306 with malicious intent for personal gain. No experiments were conducted with the necessary approval by the Ethics Committee, and several resulted in major changes to our current timeline of history. During the investigation, via the SCP-7306 journal, several outcomes have or have not occurred due to its use:

* Doctor Bryan Holland becomes a punk rock musician, never to work for the Foundation.
* Coffee in the Site-02 break room would always have sugar and cream instead of the ordinary stevia and oat milk. 
* SCP-████ &#34;The Grimace Shake&#34; is neutralized, becoming an ordinary blueberry milkshake, due to the predetermined efforts of Foundation staff.
* The Site-02 Assistant Director has a wife and three daughters, and they would never be lonely again. 
* [**DATA REDACTED**] became the President of the United States instead of working for the janitorial staff. 
* As well as similar cases conducted by Site-02 staff.

Below is the transcript from the interview prior to termination:

Dr. Jacobson, as well as other Site-02 staff who were involved in the incident, are to be interviewed, given amnestic treatment, and punished accordingly.
