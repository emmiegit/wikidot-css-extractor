**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5792 is to be kept in the unused janitorial closet at the east wing of Site-164. Cameras around the halls of Site-164 should be monitored regularly as SCP-5792 follows its route. Personnel should be familiarized with the standard route SCP-5792 takes, and report any major deviations.

**Description:** SCP-5792 is an iron shortsword believed to have originated in the Czech Republic. Prior to Incident-5792/A, SCP-5792 was contained in a small storage locker at Site-164 following POI-5792’s apprehension by the Foundation. It showed no anomalous effects before Incident-5792/A[[footnote]]It is to be noted that POI-5792 was heavily affiliated with the occult, and was brought to the Foundation regarding spiritual matters in ████████, ████████.[[/footnote]].

SCP-5792 is capable of levitation from as high as 1 meter. At most times, SCP-5792 is facing hilt upwards with its point occasionally dragging on the ground. All attempts to make physical contact with SCP-5792 are met with light to heavy resistance in the form of swings and thrusts. If left unimpeded from its usual route, SCP-5792 will not perform any actions to harm any personnel near it. All attempts to communicate with SCP-5792 result in failure.[[footnote]]See Incident-5792/B for recent developments.[[/footnote]]

If locked in a room, SCP-5792 has been noted to begin to scrape at the door or entrance, gradually making a breach big enough to fit itself through. After, it will trail the halls of Site-164 scaping the ground in various sweeping motions. Site-164&#39;s floor was reinforced with metal following an unrelated breach, thus it was deemed a more efficient use of resources to let SCP-5792 follow its normal route under supervision.[[footnote]]As of 10/11/2007, a group of personnel have tied the end of a broom to SCP-5792 following complaints of the distractions SCP-5792 made. SCP-5792 is unable to remove the broom end and complaints regarding the noises have ceased.[[/footnote]] 

When SCP-5792&#39;s daily route through the facility is completed, it will hang itself on the tool rack of the janitorial supply closet of Site-164&#39;s east wing, where it will remain until 9:00.[[footnote]]This behaviour shows similarities to Madison&#39;s agreed terms of employment prior to Incident-5792/A, including the stipulation that Madison was to not enter any containment chambers for cleaning.[[/footnote]]

As of writing, multiple written messages have been observed by SCP-5792. All are communicated by various scrapes and marks to the office carpet via SCP-5792 and are typically written as stereotypical questions many working adults make to one another. Examples include “WHENS THIS SHIFT OVER?” and &#34;HOWS THE WEATHER TODAY?&#34; and &#34;DID YOU SEE THE GAME LAST NIGHT, I WISH THE PACKERS WON&#34;. It is unknown if this shows any type of sentience on SCP-5792’s part.

**Addendum 5792-1: Incident 5792/A:** On 09/08/2007, POI-5792 attempted to breach containment utilizing SCP-5792. POI-5792 was successful in evading the notice of nearly all personnel on the site as a result. Only one personnel was a casualty outside of Site-164. 

Charles Madison, a new janitor hired by Site-164, observed POI-5792 escaping, eventually leading to a struggle as POI-5792 attempted to enter the individual&#39;s vehicle. During the struggle, Madison was believed to have been killed by a stab through the heart using SCP-5792 and thrown out of the vehicle with the anomaly. 

While dealing with the breach of containment, Madison&#39;s body remained there for ██ days. After recovering SCP-5792, agents were unable to locate the victim&#39;s corpse. SCP-5792 was placed into its storage again where it remained for ██ days.

Madison was 47 when he was killed. When personnel were dispatched to inform Madison&#39;s family of his passing in a road rage accident, the Agents recalled a family member stating that &#34;Charlie was from a different time, he was always a little grumpy on Mondays.&#34; Further review of the similarities between SCP-5792 and Madison is ongoing.

------

**Addendum 5792-2: Incident 5792/B:** On 08/09/2007, a routine inventory check for the items in storage at Site-164 found that SCP-5792 was missing from its locker. A large number of scratches at the roof and door of the locker were present when it was breached. 

SCP-5792 was later located in the mess hall, using its point to press the buttons of the vending machine located there. After ordering a cola, SCP-5792 lifted the can by using its grip and crossguards, anomalously moved it into the air, opened and mimicked a drinking motive, and after a moment, threw the can into the nearest wastebasket, causing it to spill. It then proceeded to carve out &#34;I LIKED THE OLD COKE BETTER. TOO SWEET FOR ME NOW&#34;.

SCP-5792 proceeded to enter an unused workspace[[footnote]]Formally set up for Madison.[[/footnote]], and stab through the chair. Agents attempted to grab and secure SCP-5792 but were met with resistance and light injury via SCP-5792’s hilt and fuller. After the struggle, SCP-5792 carved &#34;YOU DOING A RUN? ILL TAKE A DOUBLE-DOUBLE&#34;. Before the agents exited the space, SCP-5792 additionally carved &#34;NO CREAM AND 1 SUGAR&#34;.

Agent Raymond, who was present for Incident-5792/A, suggested bringing SCP-5792 the demands it requested. After performing its same display of &#34;drinking&#34; the beverage, SCP-5792 proceeded to write &#34;THANKS TOOTS, IM NOT ME WITHOUT MY COFFEE&#34;. After Incident-5792/B&#39;s conclusion, SCP-5792 has been considerably more amicable and communicative to personnel approaching and interacting with it, despite those actions interrupting its route. Further attempts to give various beverages to SCP-5792 as a means of communication are pending review.
