**Item #:** SCP-7071

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7071 is to be kept in a 15x15 meter humanoid containment cell, the inside walls and floor of the cell is to be covered in a four-meter thick layer of steel. When cleaning is needed, three guards are to accompany the janitors, two guards are to find and grab SCP-7071&#39;s arms, while the other guard watches SCP-7071-2. In the event of an containment breach, the halls surrounding the cell are to be set on fire, and a MTF are to be sent in. However following the incident 3/██/████ the layer of steel has been changed to be exactly six meters thick and then a four meter layer of concrete. 

**Description:** SCP-7071 is a humanoid creature with sharp claws, due to the nature of SCP-7071 all other features are unknown, it is calm unless disturbed, in which case it will attempt to trip it&#39;s prey, and proceed to thrash at it&#39;s victim&#39;s face until it is unrecognizable. It does not have the ability to speak or make sounds with it&#39;s mouth, but the most notable feature of SCP-7071 is the fact that it itself is invisible but is made of solid matter. 

SCP-7071 has the anomalous ability to create a fake hologram-like clone designated SCP-7071-2 , the clone has the appearance of a humanoid without claws and with dark blue and black skin. The clone does not collide with anything, as it is not made of solid matter, but of a gas-like substance. All attempts to aquire this gas has failed thus far. SCP-7071 is able to create this clone up to 5 meters away from itself, the clone perfectly mimics the movements of SCP-7071 which is the only way to know what SCP-7071 is doing. SCP-7071 also constantly creates a invisible liquid that is similar to oil in the way that it is extremely easy to slip in, due to this the cell must be cleaned every three days. 

Following the incident in 3/██/████ SCP-7071 was moved from site ██ to site 17.



**Incident A**

In 3/██/████ a guard was patroling a hall near to the cell when he encountered SCP-7071-2 outside the cell, he immediately notified the other guards and stood blocking the hallway so that SCP-7071 would not escape, when the other guards arrived to the scene, they were confused on how SCP-7071 escaped without breaking the cell, they immediately searched in a 5 meter radius around SCP-7071-2 to find SCP-7071, they were unable to find it. They opened the cell to see if there was a hole in the floor or roof that it could have escaped through, immediately after opening the cell door four guards were immediately knocked to the floor, the other guards started firing at the doorway and soon after they heard the loud sound of SCP-7071 falling to the ground, the team quickly grabbed SCP-7071 and contained it. One guard that was knocked down was killed by SCP-7071&#39;s attack, another guard was blinded, there were no other casualties. A report was made showing the fact that SCP-7071 can create it&#39;s clone through walls, immediately after this a new cell was made for SCP-7071 at site 17.</textarea></pre>
