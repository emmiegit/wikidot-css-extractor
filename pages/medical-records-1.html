&#34;Your new tree looks healthy. Lemon again?&#34; Simmons commented as he entered the office of Dr. Gravett. Gently, he pushed the door shut, making sure to lock it as well. 

&#34;Orange, actually&#34; she responded as Simmons made his way across the tiled flooring to the soft leather chair in front of her desk.

&#34;I thought lemons were-&#34; 

&#34;It has been brought to my attention that it may be,&#34; there was a slight pause that Simmons knew meant she was searching for the right word or phrase, &#34;disadvantageous for my mental health to keep such a reminder. And it may also negatively impact site morale given the dash-two incident.&#34; Silently, he nodded, sitting down in front of her desk to watch her as she gently spritzed the tree with water. &#34;Botany was kind enough to lend me a sapling, given my experience. It will be a pain retrieving it every reset though.&#34;

&#34;I could help,&#34; he eagerly offered, &#34;I mean, I&#39;ll only be a few halls away when we reset, and I usually have to stop by there to check in anyway, so-&#34;

&#34;Simmons?&#34; There was a slight change in Gravett&#39;s voice as she interrupted him. The conversational tone Simmons had worked so hard for being replaced by her usual commanding cadence. 

&#34;Yes, ma&#39;am?&#34; He answered, watching Gravett nervously as she set down her spritz bottle and turned to face him. Simmons swallowed nervously, keenly aware of how she studied him as she crossed the space between them, before finally sitting down across the desk from him.  

&#34;Do I look like,&#34; Gravett reached forward, grabbing Simmons&#39; tie, &#34;I need,&#34; a sharp pull, and he is only a few inches from her face, &#34;your help?&#34;

&#34;Uh, well,&#34; Simmons stammered, hoping desperately to find the right answer, &#34;Of course you don&#39;t need help. You&#39;re,&#34; he let his eye fall upon the musculature of her arm as she pulled him ever so slightly closer, &#34;incredibly capable.&#34;

&#34;So then you have an ulterior motive for wanting to help me, don&#39;t you?&#34; Simmons flushed under her interrogation, and stuttered for a few moments before Gravett cut him off &#34;No need to be shy about it, Simmons. I know exactly why you&#39;re so very eager to help me. I just want to hear you say it.&#34;

&#34;You&#39;re attractive,&#34; he couldn&#39;t help but answer her, &#34;every moment I&#39;m near you is like basking in the sun. I don&#39;t think I could resist an opportunity to be next to you if I wanted to.&#34; Gravett tugged on his tie once more, pulling his mouth onto hers.

&#34;Good answer,&#34; she murmurs against his lips, her free hand interlocking  with one of his before once more pressing her mouth against his in a heated kiss. Soon, Gravett&#39;s tongue was probing against his mouth, and he was all too eager to let her in. 

It was a long, glorious moment before they broke apart, and between shaky breaths Simmons begged, &#34;I need you.&#34; Gravett pulled him closer, and he scrambled onto her desk, and then over it, their lips crashing into each other once more as they held each other close.

Soon, Simmons felt a tug at the waist of his pants. His eyes met Gravett&#39;s for a brief second, and he nodded, reaching down to unbutton his pants. As she removed them his hands slid up her shirt, fingers trailing along her toned stomach, and up, until he&#39;s tracing a gentle trail along her breast. 

Gravett&#39;s breathing grew heavy as he teased her breast, and she let out a moan as his thumb and forefinger moved to teasing her nipple. In return she took his length in hand and began to stroke it. &#34;I love those little sounds you make,&#34; she whispered in his ear as he groaned under her touch. Then, she gently bit his ear, causing him to hiss and thrust into her grip. 

After a few seconds, Gravett dipped her head, &#34;I&#39;m going to cover your neck with hickeys,&#34; her lips brushed against the veins of his neck as Simmons swallowed, &#34;Would you like that?
&#34; 
&#34;Please,&#34; he managed to choke out between the sounds of pleasure she pulled out of him.

&#34;Please what?&#34; She demanded, as she pressed her mouth onto his neck, her free hand pulling him closer. 

&#34;Mark me,&#34; he murmured, &#34;so everyone can see I&#39;m yours.&#34; He let out a loud gasp as Gravett&#39;s teeth lightly scraped against the sensitive skin of his neck. His hand reached to her head, tangling in her hair and holding her close as he stole what breaths he could between the sounds she drug out of him.

All too soon, her lips left his neck, and her hand slowed its strokes. Simmons couldn&#39;t help the whine that escaped his throat, desperate for her to continue. &#34;It&#39;s my turn,&#34; Gravett commanded, removing her shirt and unbuttoning her pants, &#34;Like last time.&#34;

Simmons nodded, before pressing his lips to her neck returning the mark she had left on him. His fingers trailed across her areola gently, circling her nipple, teasing her like he knew she loved. Then he began a slow, steady trail of kisses down, leaving another hickey against her collarbone. 

Next his mouth found where her heart lay, and he was rewarded with a sharp gasp as he left another mark on her skin. Then his mouth replaced his hand, kissing along her breast. He loved the sound of her moans as he took her nipple in his mouth and teased it with his tongue. His now free hand, meanwhile, trailed down her stomach, reaching the waistband of her pants. Simmons quickly pulls the pants down, followed by her panties. His fingers brush against her lower lips, teasing her, before moving up to circle her clit. 

After only a moment, a needy growl demands escalation, and he obliges. His palm gently rubs against her clit as his fingers probe her entrance. They slide inside, and Gravett lets out another moan &#34;Fuck. Keep going.&#34;

Soon after she began rocking her hips into his hand, Simmons pulled his hand back. Gravett let out a growl, which quickly turned to an  anticipatory moan as his mouth wandered down her stomach, leaving a trail of kisses. A kiss at her waist, and his eyes turned to hers. She nodded, and he continued lower. 

Gravett&#39;s hands found his hair, gripping tight as he delivered his first gentle kiss, right above her clit. Then, Simmons kissed it directly, eliciting another sharp gasp from her. Then, his tongue is out, teasing her entrance, and Gravett&#39;s legs wrap tightly around his head. Her grip tightened, pulling him closer, demanding more from him. His hands found her hips, likewise pulling her to his mouth. 
Simmons wished he could live the rest of his life with his head locked between her thighs. He&#39;d gladly trade food, drink, and even breath for an eternity of this, especially as he delivers Gravett to her climax. “Fuck!” she shouts, at the same moment a stream of liquid hits the side of his face.  Then Simmons pulls back to look up at her panting, with a grin on his face. 

Before either could speak, there was a knock at the door, followed by a voice, “Dr. Gravett are you alright? There was a shout.” 

They shared a nervous look, before Gravett responded, “It’s fine. Just&#34; she paused for a moment, &#34;a small biohazard spill.&#34;

&#34;Do you need any assistance cleaning it up?&#34;

&#34;Already handling it fine,&#34; she responded, reaching into her desk to produce a wet wipe to clean Simmons&#39; face, &#34;Get back to work.&#34; After a moment without response, Gravett turned to address Simmons, &#34;That didn&#39;t kill the mood did it? I wanted to return the favor.&#34;

He laughed, somewhere between apologetic and nervous, &#34;Yeah, it kind of did. Sorry.&#34; There was a slight pause, and his lips parted, stopping just short of saying something else. 

&#34;What?&#34; 

&#34;It&#39;s nothing.&#34;

&#34;Simmons,&#34; Gravett&#39;s commanding tone returned, &#34;If you don&#39;t tell me, I won&#39;t be returning the favor tonight.&#34;

&#34;Stop calling it a favor!&#34; Simmons quietly exclaimed, hoping to avoid drawing attention to the room again. Seeing her mildly shocked expression, he sighed, &#34;I didn&#39;t mean to be snappy. It&#39;s just… you&#39;re my partner! Doing things with you isn&#39;t a favor!&#34; He paused for a moment, and as Gravett remained quiet, he continued, calmer, &#34;It&#39;s just… I love you, and it feels like calling it a favor taints it a little. I know that&#39;s not what you meant but…&#34;

As Simmons trailed off, Gravett responded softly, &#34;You love me?&#34;

&#34;Oh I,&#34; Simmons blushed and stammered, &#34;I… yeah I do. And I understand if you&#39;re not comfortable with,&#34;

&#34;No, I am!&#34; She quickly interrupted him, then paused, &#34;I love you too. That&#39;s why I had you come by today. I was going to show you my orange sapling,&#34;

&#34;What does the tree have to do with anything?&#34; Simmons interrupted. 

&#34;Oranges are your favorite fruit,&#34; Gravett&#39;s blush only intensified, &#34;you mentioned that at breakfast last week. I figured the tree could be how I showed you that I was serious about us, about everything.&#34; She moved towards Simmons, wrapping him in a hug he gladly returned. &#34;I just… chickened out when you got here, and it was easier to do what we normally do.&#34;

&#34;Oh,&#34; Simmons murmured, &#34;We both need to work on communication, don&#39;t we?&#34;

&#34;Maybe,&#34; Gravett agreed, &#34;I&#39;m just glad I was able to get it off my chest, and that you feel the same way.&#34;
