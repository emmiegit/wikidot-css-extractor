Following their capture by 2085-A, access to SCP-2117 was cut off, as SCP-2117-A-1 instances failed to function. A transmission received by Site-19 indicated that 2085-A was holding Zeta-9 hostage, but would keep one-way communication open so that Z9 could report their findings to the Foundation.

As of 6/14/2019 , Z9 returned to earth with minimal casualties. Extended Exploration Logs of note are included below.

//Z9-1 is seen in Foundation-issue fatigues, with a laser cutter at her side. She is equipped with an oxygen tank and a mask over their mouth.//

**Z9-1:** It&#39;s been about three and a half days since a goddamn woman with cat ears press-ganged us into finding her sisters. They&#39;ve disabled the cubes. She says she&#39;ll turn them back on once we find them.

**Z9-2:** Christ, this place is massive.

**Z9-1:** How big are we talking?

**Z9-2:** Using one of those Zip Lifts? It&#39;d take us about two hours to travel the length of the ship.

**Z9-1:** So, uh, Z9-1-- that&#39;s me-- and -2 are on one team. -3 and Tech-1 are on another -4 and Tech-2 make up the last one. And--

**2085-A:** I&#39;m your voice with an internet connection. 

**Z9-1:** So, what the fuck happened here? The ship said 90% of the crew was gone.

**2085-A:** More. You know how on //Star Trek//, there are a bunch of civilians on the ship that never go acknowledged whenever the //Enterprise// rams a Borg cube or something?

**Z9-1:** How many civilians are we talking?

**2085-A:** At least 400. Refugees, mostly, from universes that didn&#39;t want them. A few &#39;skips&#39; on here, even, that escaped you.

**Z9-2:** So, we&#39;re heading to the Brig?

**2085-A:** Like the name suggests, it&#39;s where we kept troublemakers. Most of the time it was just a drunk tank. Zip-Lift will take you there.

**Z9-1:** I fucking hate these things.

**2085-A:** Nobody liked them. They were there for about a month before everyone went away.

//Z9-1 and Z9-2 both climb on the Zip-Lift platform, bracing themselves on the guardrails.//

**Z9-1:** A month? Must&#39;ve taken a lot of work to install them.

**2085-A:** We didn&#39;t install them. They just appeared. A lot of stuff on the ship does that.

//The Zip-Lift begins movement at 300km/h.//

**Z9-1:** That doesn&#39;t concern you? That tech just appears?

**2085-A:** It nearly gave me fucking heart attacks. Imagine going to the coffee machine in your room, only to find that, surprise, your coffee machine is now the size of your desk and makes any drink known to man! Hold on, call waiting.

//After two minutes, the Zip-Lift lands in front of the Brig.//

**2085-A:** Okay. Scanners are being fucked with. Good news is the brig is lead-lined, which reduces interference. There&#39;s a life sign in there.

**Z9-2:** Wouldn&#39;t the lead interfere with scanning more?

**2085-A:** Don&#39;t think about it, or it won&#39;t work.

//Z9-1 and Z9-2 look at each other. Z9-1 shrugs. Camera shows them entering the Brig.//

//The Brig is a structure at least 2km tall, with several walls lined with jail cells in a variety of sizes and configurations, including metal bars, plexiglass barriers, a force field, and what is believed to be a walk-in Scranton Reality Anchor. Over 200 cells are visible.//

**2085-A:** Turning off gravity now.

//The artificial gravity in the Brig is deactivated. Z9-1 activates a micro-thruster and flies to the top of the structure, while Z9-2 starts sweeping the bottom.//

**Z9-1:** You said Wizard was dead. Isn&#39;t Wizard the AI?

**2085-A:** One and the same. We uploaded him, before he died.

**Z9-1:** I&#39;m sorry.

**2085-A:** Sympathy. Is the Foundation in this universe not made up of Anti-Spirals? 

**Z9-2:** We got a massive kick in the ass in the 80&#39;s. Half a site signed a suicide pact and acted it out. We realized that &#39;Cold, not Cruel&#39; didn&#39;t work for people. 

**Z9-1:** Not saying you&#39;re not people. No, wait, that literally... 

**2085-A:** &#39;ts okay. I&#39;ve gotten worse.

**Z9-2:** The Foundation started treating its employees like people, and that kind of trickled down to you things.

**Z9-1:**  Hold up--

//Z9-1 stops in midair in front of a walk-in Reality Anchor. A humanoid figure is seen inside it, floating in midair.//

**Z9-1:** We got something. Mitch, get up here.

//Z9-2 arrives by Z9-1&#39;s side, and both land on the walkway by the cell.//

**Z9-1:** I think we need to shut that off before we open it.

**Z9-2:** Any idea how to shut one of these off, 2085-A?

//No response.//

**Z9-1:** She&#39;s probably talking with one of the other teams.

**Z9-2:** No big, we worked with these in training.

**Z9-1:** Let me pull up the manual.

//Z9-1 brings up the file on their tablet, and begins reading it.//

**Z9-1:** Okay, first you have to disable the Kant counter--

**Z9-2:** That... won&#39;t be necessary.

**Z9-1:** What do you mean?

//Z9-2 indicates the control panel. Two buttons, &#39;On&#39; and &#39;Off&#39; are visible.//

**Z9-1:** Huh.

//Z9-2 depresses the &#39;off&#39; button. The cage on the front of the walk-in anchor opens. The feet of a humanoid female are seen, and soft groaning is heard from within.//

**2085-A:** Oh my god. Who do you have there? Who is it? 

//Z9-1 attempts to enter the anchor.//

**2085-A:** DON&#39;T! Don&#39;t go in. Just- just put the camera in there, and the mic. Your headset. Let me talk to them, they- they could be hurt, or scared, or Jesus Christ get it together.

//Z9-1 removes their headset and pushes it inside, where the microgravity propels it forward. The camera shows a woman with a pair of feline ears and tabby coloration in their hair.//

**2085-A:** Is she alive? How do I turn on thermals on this thing?

//Z9-1 activates thermal imaging. The individual inside gives off body heat consistent with a living human being.//

**2085-A:** She&#39;s okay. She must&#39;ve-- she has a friend who ended up in here alot. Drunk tank, remember? She-- she probably saw something happening, and stuck herself in here. 

**Z9-1:** Wait, she&#39;s been in here for almost six months with no water?

**2085-A:** Jesus, has it been that long? We&#39;re cyborgs, we go into low-power mode if we don&#39;t get enough water or oxygen. Okay, uh. Far end of the top catwalk, there&#39;s a medical station. First-aid, gurney, saline, everything you need. There might even be rations.

**Z9-2:** I&#39;ll get it.

**2085-A:** Bring her back to base. Fuck-- team three&#39;s running into shit. Euclid engine failed. Hold on.

//Z9-2 brings out a gurney and medical supplies. He frowns suddenly.//

**Z9-2:** It&#39;s at least an hour walk back to base. We can&#39;t use a Zip-Lift with her in this condition.

//Z9-1 unloads the female from the anchor onto the gurney, letting out a gasp as they see a large section of their tail missing.// 

**Z9-2:** Bandage that up. Don&#39;t-- don&#39;t let A see this.

//Z9-1 attempts to bandage the tail. The individual startles awake, swiping at Z9-1, the force inadvertently pushing her away in the microgravity.//

**2085-A:** Let me talk to her. Give her that comm link I gave you.

//Z9-2 offers the comm link to the individual, who places it in their left ear. They calm after several seconds, and then nod.//

**2085-C:** ...yeah, you can&#39;t hear nodding. Sorry, sis. What happened to my tail?

**Z9-1:** I&#39;m trying to bandage it.

**2085-C:** Not like that you&#39;re not. Have you never done a tourniquet on a tail?

//Z9-1&#39;s expression is slightly annoyed.//

**2085-C:** Fair enough. Give me that. 

//2085-C takes the bandages from Z9-1, and other medical supplies from Z9-2.//

**2085-C:** Sis, turn the gravity back on? I don&#39;t want to get an embolism from the morphine and antibiotic injectors.

//Z9-1 and Z9-2 are both floating several hundred meters over the floor of the Brig at this point.//

**Z9-1:** Maybe wait until we&#39;re on solid flooring?

**2085-C:** Yeah, fair point.

//Z9-1, -2 and 2085-C all propel themselves down to ground level. Gravity is re-activated, and 2085-C resumes administering itself medical treatment.//

**2085-C:** Okay, the Zip-Lift has a low impact setting. Put me on it, and then put yourselves on another one.

//2085-C pauses.//

**2085-C:** Why is only Boss talking to me?

//Z9-1, Z9-4, and Z9-Tech-2 all alight off of a Zip-Lift.//

**Z9-1:** Okay, it&#39;s getting better. Not sure if the lifts are slower, or if I&#39;m just becoming masochistic.

**Z9-4:** So, day twelve, and we&#39;ve found all of one sister. Out of four. Last six sectors were dead ends.

**Z9-Tech-2:** Vented the core yesterday, which let thermal sensors pick up things better. There&#39;s at least two heat signatures in there.

**Z9-4:** It doesn&#39;t feel any cooler.

**Z9-1:** We&#39;ve been told not to question it. We on our own for this?

**Z9-4:** A&#39;s looking for her sisters. Sick of not being able to find them. Took C with her.

**Z9-1:** Why are we calling her C? Shouldn&#39;t she be B?

**Z9-Tech-2:** They insisted on it. What part of the ship is this, anyway?

//Z9-Tech-2&#39;s camera looks upwards. A sign displays the words &#34;Menagerie&#34;.//

**Z9-Tech-2:** Ah.

**Z9-1:** Well, let&#39;s not waste any time. 

//Z9-1 attempts to open the doors to the Menagerie using a control panel. They resist, as if stuck; when opening, a fibrous, web-like substance joins the doors together, before splitting apart.//

**Z9-Tech-2:** What the hell is that? You guys have giant spiders on the ship?

**2085-C:** Don&#39;t think so.

//The fibrous substance begins blinking in a pattern consistent with Memetic Lures. Z9-1, Z9-4 and Z9-Tech-2 all drop their equipment and enter the fiber.//

**2085-C:** Oh no. No, no, no, no, no. No.

**2085-A:** What?

**2085-C:** Our red-headed step sister is in the menagerie. 

//Z9-1, -4 and -Tech-2&#39;s cameras see only fibrous mass. Z9-1&#39;s camera is destroyed by a sudden impact, believed to have been delivered by a pipe wrench. Z9-4 and Z9-Tech-2 are caught in seperate snare traps.//

//In the shadows, a hand is seen on a guard rail next to an animal cage. Another hand holds a switch; the rest of the figure, except for an eyepatch, is obscured. Z9-1&#39;s form is unconscious next to them.//

**2085-D:** All right, ya fucks. You&#39;re gonna tell me what you did my friends, my sisters, and my ship.

//Z9 is unresponsive until 2085-D flips the switch, and all lights deactivate.//

**2085-D:** I&#39;ve got about two-hundred and ten killer memes programmed into these lights, and another thirty on audio. You start fuckin&#39; talking, or I&#39;m gonna go G.E. Requiem on your asses and reset you to zero over and over.

**Z9-4:** Your sisters sent you to get us! 

**2085-D:** Fuck you. 

//2085-D turns the switch on their controller, briefly activating on a memetic stunning agent.//

**2085-D:** One year. A whole year where we couldn&#39;t see each other, couldn&#39;t talk, didn&#39;t know if any of us were still //alive//. I saw what fucked up the ship. It ate an entire congregation of Mormons on a goddamn metaphysical level. And you fucks //worship// it.

**2085-D:** So, I&#39;m going to ask one more fuckin&#39; time, before I get nasty. Where. Are. My. Sis--

//2085-D stops talking suddenly, looking into the middle distance. Stepping into the light briefly, red hair is shown, along with a single red feline ear.//

**2085-D:** The chat&#39;s working? I-- who&#39;s doing this? How do you--

//Z9-4 and -Tech-2 look at each other, confused.//

**Z9-Tech-2:** Their eyes aren&#39;t... organic. I think they have interfaces on them. Heads-up displays.

**2085-D:** Yeah. With chat windows. What the fuck, what the fuck, what the--

//2085-D turns on another memetic agent, designed to cause sleep in the viewers.//

**2085-D:** I need privacy. Jesus.

//2085-D sits down in front of a cage, looking away from Z9&#39;s cameras. Sounds of emotional distress can be heard from them.//

**2085-D:** Fuck me. Glad you got it back online without me.

//There are several minutes of silence following this. Z9-1 stirs next to 2085-D. Dialog occurs between them, briefly, before 2085-D activates an binaural adrenaline-production meme, causing all Z9 members to wake up.//

**2085-D:** Get up, ya lazy fucks. The Company&#39;s still down two employees, and Boss gave me permission to make all of ya into fuel for the bioreactor if ya don&#39;t comply.

**2085-A:** That&#39;s not a joke. She&#39;s the only one of us who knows how to load the damn thing.

**Z9-4:** Uh. You&#39;re gonna have to cut us down.

**2085-D:** You got knives, and the webs have the tensile strength of a nanotube weave and the give of a marshmallow. Cut yourselves down. 

**Z9-1:** What the fuck is a G.E. Requiem?

**Z9-1:** This is Zeta-9 Agent Meghan Yu. I&#39;ve... been called to the bridge by the 2085 instances. They want to show me something. Don&#39;t know what.

//Z9-1 boards a Zip-Lift.//

**Z9-1:** I&#39;ve been checking the spedometers. These things have been getting faster, not slower. If anything, I&#39;m just acclimatiiiiiiii---

//Z9-1&#39;s Zip-Lift proceeds at speeds of over 600km/h, before landing at the Bridge.//

**Z9-1:** //Fuck me!// Okay, ow. Ergh. 

**Z9-1:** I&#39;ve noticed that, despite the fact that I&#39;m going at speeds that should make me blind, I don&#39;t feel wind on my eyes. Again, I&#39;ve been told to not question it, which... I don&#39;t know why the fuck.

//Z9-1 disembarks from the Zip-Lift and makes her way onto the bridge. A large command console is in the center, with 2085-C attempting to extricate another 2085 instance from it. 2085-A is standing by a console further to the front of the room. Through the windows, a view of Titan and Saturn can be seen.//

**Z9-1:** Holy shit.

**2085-A:** Yeah. Pictures don&#39;t prepare you. 

//Z9-1 approaches the front of the ship, and looks upwards at a protrusion visible from above the viewing area.//

**Z9-1:** Is that a--

**2085-E:** It&#39;s my husband!

//Z9-1 startles and turns to face 2085-E. 2085-E is largely identical to the other 2085 instances, with the exception of a silver-blue coloration in their hair, ears and tail. Their arms appear to have merged with the command console.//

**2085-C:** She tried to fire it at whatever attacked the ship. Ended up becoming one with it in the process.

**2085-E:** Momoko, I fucking //win//. I&#39;ve been inside it! The Grand Wave Motion Projection Cannon! It&#39;s my husbaaaand!

**2085-C:** She&#39;s a bit loopy from the morphine. Normally not this talkative.

**2085-A:** That&#39;s where the name of the ship comes from. //Daitaihomaru//, or &#34;The Big Gun&#34;. Blew up the moon with it.

**Z9-1:** You did //what?!?//

**2085-A:** We did a whole Super Sentai thing where we all yelled out the name of the attack at once. It was great. 

**Z9-1:** Okay, but-- why did you blow up the moon?

**2085-A:** I&#39;ll show you. Wizard, playback Phase Four.

//2085-A brings up a holographic projection, playing back a battle involving SCP-2117 and an entity tentatively dubbed SCP-2117-Omega. The entity resembles an amorphous configuration of tentacles, and several instances have already expired by the time the recording starts.//

**2085-A:** That&#39;s an Overseer. Ran the Foundation in our universe.

**Z9-1:** Yeah, well, our Overseers don&#39;t look like that. 

**2085-A:** Probably why you&#39;re... well, you. As far as we can tell, the whole thing with half a site offing itself happened at home, but it got swept under the rug.

**Z9-1:** Jesus. Do these things eat misery or something?

**2085-A:** I think they feed off of the status quo. That&#39;s not what I wanted to show you, though.

//2085-A steps aside from the control console, revealing a plaque. Even with the presence of SCP-2117-1, it is mostly illegible, due to damage to its surface.//

**2085-A:** Get a good long look at it. 

&gt; Greetings to you [illegible]. We are certain that you must be as bewildered as we were upon discovering this [illegible]] rightfully so. The universe is a dangerous place, as we are [illegible]
&gt; 
&gt; [illegible] the vessel //Solidarity// only appears in those realities in which an organization exists to preserve normalcy [illegible] As far as we know there is only one //Solidarity//[illegible]
&gt; 
&gt; It appeared to us a long time ago, and was ignored until such time as we faced a great threat from beyond the confines of our solar system. Whether this threat was attracted by the vessel, we cannot be sure, but it was sufficient to preserve [illegible]
&gt; 
&gt; So, then, to you, whoever you are, we, the people of Earth, and the Sixth Echelon [illegible]no matter the distance or gulf of time between us, so long as we seek to preserve our existence we are never truly alone.

//Attached to the bottom of the message is an engraving of 13 individuals, simian in appearance and possessing distinctive sagittal crests, all dressed in identical uniforms. The individuals stand in a semicircle behind an image of a planet visually similar to the Earth, with the exception of a large landmass at the north pole and the presence of a series of islands extending westwards from the Straits of Gibraltar.//

**Z9-1:** I can&#39;t read some of this, but what I can... it&#39;s not English. How...

**2085-A:** Meme throughout the ship. I&#39;m speaking Japanese right now, and you just don&#39;t notice.

**Z9-1:** Yeah, no.

**2085-A:** Figured you wouldn&#39;t buy that.  Notice anything important?

//Z9-1 re-reads the plaque.//

**Z9-1:** &#34;Only one //Solidarity//&#34;. Seems... off.

**2085-A:** It&#39;s Jumpy&#39;s fault. He&#39;s been going into universes with their own //Daitaihomaru// and bringing back bits of them-- or whole ships. We don&#39;t know why it&#39;s bringing things back, or even how it got other //Daitaihomaru//s. And it changes the ship, too.

**2085-A:** I&#39;ve been looking over the logs since I woke up. We never set up an automated signal from Wizard, we&#39;ve never had those cubes before, and our power core didn&#39;t have a reboot button. It changed the ship so you could save us.

**Z9-1:**  It seems like it was nice here. Fun, even. 

**2085-A:** Space Mormons know how to party, yeah. 

**Z9-1:** Maybe Jumpy just... wanted you to have fun? You got roller coasters that go at one-third Mach as a means of transportation, a goddamn anti-grav bounce house, and your theater has movies from about 80 different universes.

//2085-A smiles.//

**2085-A:** That&#39;s the theory B had. We got lonely? Jumpy brought new people. Things were getting cramped? Bring in new ship parts. B kept on pining for battle armor, typed it into the replicator at least once a week. And after Jumpy vanished for a couple of days last year, it finally--

//2085-A blinks.//

**2085-A:** I&#39;m an idiot. Where would a gun fetishist go in a crisis but the armory? There are twenty of them on the ship, all twenty decks down.

**Z9-1:** I&#39;ll scramble the team.

**2085-A:** D&#39;s the hacker-- she&#39;s the only one who can crack the door locks on the armory.

**2085-D:** You know that expression &#39;I trust you as far as I can throw you&#39;?

**Z9-4:** Yeah, why?

**2085-D:** It doesn&#39;t work here. I could throw your pasty white ass across the ship if the gravity were off. 

//2085-D produces a PDA from the pocket of their trenchcoat.//

**2085-D:** Let me put it this way: when we die, if I had the deciding vote as to whether or not we left our bodies with you or Ed fucking Gein, I&#39;d go for Gein.

**Z9-4:** Were you always like this? 

**2085-D:** Y&#39;know, when you&#39;re literally grown so that some idiot who&#39;s inheriting his father&#39;s company doesn&#39;t commit //Karōshi//[[footnote]] Japanese, literally &#34;death by overwork&#34;.[[/footnote]] ya realize from &#39;birth&#39; that people kind of suck. 

//2085-D crouches by a small door, which reads &#34;Armory 15&#34;, working on their PDA. They produce a glass bottle of an unidentified soft drink; the neck of the bottle appears to contain a glass marble.//

**2085-D:** None of us trust you. We&#39;re not going to tell you our names, not even our fake ones. You don&#39;t deserve that.

//Z9-4 points their index fingers at 2085-D, one eye shut.//

**Z9-4:** Sugi ni omae wa &#39;I&#39;m going to punch you in the fucking face if you do that again!&#39; to iu.

//2085-D grabs Z9-4 by the collar of their fatigues and makes a fist.//

**2085-D:** I&#39;m going to punch you in the fucking face if you do that again!

//2085-D pauses and releases Z9-4.//

**2085-D:** So that&#39;s how that worked. 

//2085-D resumes work on their PDA, taking a sip from the bottle.//

**2085-D:** How do you know that, anyway?

**Z9-4:** Downloaded the audio log about you laughing at the Mormons.

**2085-D:** That&#39;s probably the least offensive invasion of privacy anyone&#39;s ever given us.

**Z9-4:** That log was, what, barely two years after you stole this? It&#39;s been almost thirty. You kind of just sound...

**2085-D:** Tired? Yeah, I am fuckin&#39; tired. I&#39;m dyin&#39;, been angry all my damn life, and there wasn&#39;t a time I was on Earth that wasn&#39;t spent in the dark or runnin&#39; from the law.

//2085-D puts their PDA down and drinks from the bottle for several seconds.//

**2085-D:** It&#39;s hard to keep up the spirit of adventure and friendship when you&#39;ve been doing this for thirty years, and you&#39;ve never gotten to experience Akihabara in a context that wasn&#39;t &#34;blowing up underground gene clinics&#34;. 

**Z9-4:** The rest of them seem to be doing okay.

**2085-D:** They&#39;re puttin&#39; on a show. I didn&#39;t do that when I was in your cell, I&#39;m not doin&#39; it now. The world sucks, we&#39;re dead in seven days, and I&#39;m. Kind of fucking sick of being angry.

//2085-D growls.//

**2085-D:** If she&#39;s alive in there, I&#39;m going to kill her. She did something to the encryption--

//The door to the armory opens. 2085-B-- black and white hair and ears, with a headband around its head-- steps out.//

**2085-B:** It wasn&#39;t locked, ya dingbat. I was holding it shut-- I wanted to make sure it was actually you.

**2085-D:** You lost the war, by the way. Your little sis fucked the Wave Motion Cannon.

**2085-B:** Eh. &#39;bout time someone won it.

//Z9 and all 2085 instances are standing on the bridge, having just signed a document drafted by the Foundation to pass ownership of SCP-2117 to the Foundation following the date of the 2085 instances&#39;s deaths. 2085-A steps forward.//

**2085-A:** All right, replicator spat up some of these.

//2085-A offers a set of cubes identical to SCP-2117-A-1 instances, but with different wording on them. Z9-Tech-2 takes a cube.//

**Z9-Tech-2:** &#39;Our home is in the //Daitaihomaru//&#39;s berth, but for now, we return to Earth.&#39; Where is this going to take us, though?

**2085-A:** Field in outside of Nagano. That&#39;s where it first impacted.

**Z9-1:** Hear that, guys? Get ready to take us back.

//Z9-1 looks at the assembled 2085 instances.//

**Z9-1:** So, what are you going to do when... y&#39;know.

**2085-B:** Drink, play games, watch anime. Reminisce on the good old times.

**2085-C:** I&#39;m going to be monitoring all of us, making sure we&#39;re comfortable. 

**Z9-4:** We have gene therapy on Earth. You really don&#39;t have to--

**2085-E:** It&#39;s not just our genetics that are gonna fail. Our original augmentations are designed to give, too. 

//2085-E steps forward and offers a USB drive to Z9-1.//

**2085-E:** Tutorial on how to run this ship. Includes pass codes to activate the Wave-Motion Gun, how to feed Jumpy, how to use the crew manifest--

**2085-D:** Where the fuck is Jumpy? He get taken, too?

**2085-C:** That&#39;s... hmm. The original scan said there were twelve lifeforms on the ship, when you guys were here. Us makes eleven...

//SCP-2117-A-3 appears behind 2085 instances, reaching out a long tongue to consume the SCP-2117-A-1 instances that Z9-Tech-2 is holding.//

**Z9-Tech-2:** Hey! What the-- oh my god that&#39;s an alien.

//2085-E jumps on SCP-2117-A-4 and begins attempting to induce vomiting.//

**2085-E:** Give! Spit it out, Jumpy, now!

//SCP-2117-A-3 swallows the SCP-2117-A-1 instances, before vanishing from underneath 2085-E.//

**2085-C:** What the-- why?!

**SCP-2117-A-2:** I told him to.

//Z9 and all 2085 instances turn to view the main windows of SCP-2117&#39;s bridge, which have turned into a screen. An image of a sickly man in an astronaut&#39;s uniform wearing a wizard&#39;s hat looks down at those assembled.//

**SCP-2117-A-2:** I can&#39;t see you die, girls. You&#39;ve barely been off this ship in the last twenty-five years. The Foundation in this universe is still a bunch of bastards who keep people locked up for having wings and deny the world the cure for cancer--

**Z9-2:** Hey!

**SCP-2117-A-2:** But they&#39;re a little better.

//SCP-2117-A-2&#39;s view screen pulls up images of news headlines from the year 2019. These headlines include://

&gt; How a religion is taking the tech industry by storm

&gt; Secretary General Guterres: &#34;We can&#39;t keep ignoring Samothrace&#34;

&gt; Bigfoot sightings at an all-time high

&gt; After two months, ten children in experimental drug trial remain cured of HIV

&gt; Illegal genetic experimentation ring, first of its kind, exposed in Africa

&gt; The Horizon Initiative: Charity or Cult?

&gt; Ruins discovered off of South America could be Atlantis

**2085-D:** The fuck is all this?

**Z9-4:** Doomsday preparations. 

**2085-A:** What?

**Z9-2:** The world&#39;s gonna end some time in the next couple of years. We&#39;re planning to save it, and in case we do, we need to soften the blow.

**SCP-2117-A-2:** Article 7 of the Black Rabbit Company charter: &#39;We’re family. No one goes hungry, no one gets left behind.&#39; I left you behind.

**2085-A:** Wiz, you died. That&#39;s okay.

**SCP-2117-A-2:** You five were the greatest adventure I&#39;ve ever had. But you&#39;ve never had any peace-- it&#39;s always been running through the stars and through the universes. And death isn&#39;t peace-- it&#39;s nothing. 

**SCP-2117-A-2:** I don&#39;t just want you to live. I want you to live with something resembling peace.

//The 2085 instances all display signs of confusion and distress. 2085-C hugs 2085-D. All parties remain silent for several minutes. 2085-A speaks, in a strained voice.//

**2085-A:** By unanimous vote, the Black Rabbit Company will go with Meghan Yu, Mitchell Arnold, Craig Brown, Francis Lucas, and all associated parties to Earth, to receive treatment for their current condition.

**2085-B:** It&#39;s going to take me a while to find the blueprints in--

//2085-B coughs.//

**2085-B:** &#39;scuse me, to find the blueprints for the cubes in the replicator. Take a load off until then.

**2085-D:** I figure we got another day before our livers give out. Who wants saké?
