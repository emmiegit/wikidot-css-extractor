**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7097 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. LCD displays are to constantly stream reality TV programs, and triple-wide ventilation systems are to diffuse various perfumes in one-hour intervals.

**Addendum-7097-1 (01-27-2023):** A minimum of 250,000 live female Drosophila specimens are to be contained near SCP-7097&#39;s cell.

**Addendum-7097-2 (02-08-2023):** SCP-7097 is to be released from its cell one day per week. SCP-7097 has unlimited visitation privileges, and all questions regarding the entity are to be directed to Dr. Landstrom and Dr. Kelly.

**Description:** SCP-7097 is a sapient entity that inhabits female members of the Drosophila genus,[[footnote]]Commonly known as fruit flies.[[/footnote]] and has a strong proclivity for learning and/or sharing personal secrets.

SCP-7097 will inhabit the nearest suitable Drosophila specimen after dying, with no noticeable change in personality or mannerisms. The entity is fully aware of this and may attempt breach-by-suicide if insufficiently entertained. If sufficiently entertained, SCP-7097 will become dormant and unresponsive.

SCP-7097 has an innate sense for secrets, which testing determined is a form of anomalous olfactory detection. SCP-7097 often utilizes this sense during communication, and it has been known to make unsolicited remarks about Foundation staff and/or initiate games such as truth or dare.

**Addendum-7097-1 (02-07-2023):** SCP-7097 is capable of recording and replaying video and audio from its compound eyes and antennae, respectively. Recordings produced by the entity achieve quality benchmarks far beyond any Foundation technology.

**Foreword:** Although SCP-7097 was recaptured, the entity attempted to evade capture by hiding in Dr. Landstrom&#39;s esophagus. In order to avoid further containment breaches, Dr. Landstrom had to be classified as potentially contaminated and detained with the entity.

**Dr. Mendoza:** SCP-7097 was in your upper digestive system for over an hour before we located it. Who&#39;s to say it didn&#39;t lay eggs there in the hopes of reincarnating at the perfect moment? The second we let you out we could have another breach on our hands!

**Dr. Landstrom:** Wait, what? //[turns to SCP-7097]// You went down my //gullet?//

**Dr. Landstrom:** -so they wrote a letter inviting me to interview, and I&#39;ve been at the Foundation ever since. Hard to believe it&#39;s been a year since then, some days it feels like I just got here. You?
 _
**SCP-7097:** I... woke up in a desert field about a year ago, //[furtive glance]// and that&#39;s all I can remember. I kept trying to find friends out in the world, but most people just swatted or screamed at me.

**Dr. Landstrom:** Say, why&#39;d you want to talk to Grace so badly anyways?

**Dr. Landstrom [to Dr. Mendoza]:** Hey! Can you put Grace on the intercom for a second?
 _
**Dr. Mendoza [into intercom]:** Dr. Kelly has more important responsibilities than entertaining you two, especially after the ruckus you caused.
 _
**Dr. Kelly [to Dr. Mendoza]:** Can&#39;t you put me on for just a little bit?
 _
**Dr. Mendoza [to Dr. Kelly]:** No, and I don&#39;t want you loitering around here anymore. I told you Michael will be fine, now please get back to your work. 
 _
**Dr. Mendoza [into intercom]:** You won&#39;t be hearing or seeing Dr. Kelly for the foreseeable future. I&#39;ll also have someone send remote work equipment through the pneumatic doors so you can get back to your research, Dr. Landstrom.

 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** Really?
 _
**SCP-7097:** Nope! I got it from the lab where I was made. Those eggheads had an acronym they used as a shorthand. I guess people got tired of calling me “the entity” all the time.

**Dr. Landstrom:** What was it?

//SCP-7097 flexes its antennae. A recording of a male voice says “And this is the __Counterspying Anomalistic Sapient Silent Identifying Drosophila Entity!__ But you can just call her Cassidy for short.”//

**Dr. Landstrom:** Hmmm, some of those terms are kind of a reach. And-
 _
**SCP-7097:** And they used an “e” instead of a “y” to make the acronym fit, I know. It doesn’t really matter what those eggheads were trying to say. Cassidy wasn’t some stupid nerd-speak term to me, it was my //name.//

**Dr. Landstrom:** How would you-

**SCP-7097:** I was outside the door, genius, and I&#39;ve got enough brain cells to connect the dots. Not to mention Gerald told me about the flowers addressed to Grace that //someone// threw in the dumpster.

 _
**SCP-7097:** Oh, don’t act so surprised. It’s obvious if you just pay attention. She likes your weird jokes. She likes your weird way of talking. And she even likes your billion-page nerd book about bugs. Honestly, it’s crazy how the both of you are so weird in the same ways. Sometimes I think //you two// should be the anomaly, instead of my perfectly normal self.

**Dr. Landstrom:** You mean that?

 _
**Dr. Landstrom:** //[glares]// The first part.

**SCP-7097:** Not how I remember it, but ok. Anyways, you just let me handle the wordplay. It’s my specialty after all. All you&#39;ve got to do is show up and look pretty.

**Dr. Landstrom:** Well, I suppose I can-

**Closing Statement:** SCP-7097 handed over recorded logs one week after Dr. Landstrom&#39;s date with Dr. Kelly. Shortly afterward, Dr. Kelly sent a message to Site Director Max Maxwell. The following was his reply:
 _
&gt; = **//Thank you for your message, and congratulations on being promoted to co-head of research into SCP-7097. To your question, there isn&#39;t a strict ban on relationships between Foundation staff. Were we to try and enforce such a policy, we would quickly lose many of our best and brightest agents! That being said, the Foundation does advise caution in delicate matters such as these. Use your best judgment, Grace. As for your request to take a joint leave of absence on February 14th, I&#39;ll put it through the standard review protocol and let you know in about a week.//**
