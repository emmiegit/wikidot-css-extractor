**Special Containment Procedures:** N/A
[[collapsible show=&#34;See Archived Containment Procedures&#34; hide=&#34;Hide Archived Procedures&#34;]]
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6231 is to be kept within a standard 20-gallon terrarium fitted with the basic needs of a regular //Agalychnis callidryas//. These include filtered freshwater, a diet of crickets, mealworms and Dubia roaches, a 20°-30° Celsius, damp and humid environment and UV lighting[[footnote]]This should be replaced every 5 to 6 months.[[/footnote]]. Consumption of ice cream offered to personnel by SCP-6231 is allowed and encouraged.
[[/collapsible]]

**Description:** SCP-6231 is a sentient male //Agalychnis callidryas// (Red-eyed tree frog) that is capable of producing ice cream from its salivary glands. This ice cream has no inherent anomalous effects and is safe for consumption. The ice cream does not harm SCP-6231 like it would for a member of the same species.

SCP-6231 has thus far proven capable of producing twelve different flavours; coconut, chocolate, vanilla, cookies and cream, strawberry, blue raspberry, mango, mint, mint chocolate chip pistachio, maple, and french vanilla. When asked for a flavour, SCP-6231 will produce an amount of ice cream that is capable of filling an entire cone in one to four minutes, depending on the flavour the subject had asked for. SCP-6231 appears capable of utilizing its mouth to prevent the ice cream it produces from melting. SCP-6231 has also been seen to communicate using small notes.

**Addendum.6231.I: Discovery**
On 16/10/2021, Agent Ronald Hudson responded to reports of a frog giving ice cream to children in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. When Agent Hudson arrived, SCP-6231 had been producing ice cream for children at a playground. Soon after this, SCP-6231 was taken by one of these said children. Upon questioning the other children on SCP-6231&#39;s location, they pointed at the child who had taken SCP-6231, who was at that point eating ice cream. Shortly after this, SCP-6231 was confiscated and moved to Site-250. It is unknown how SCP-6231 arrived in said playground, as //Agalychnis callidryas// is native to Central and South America. Witnesses say that SCP-6231 was left at the playground by a child who then ran away. The identity of this child is unknown.

**Addendum.6231.II:** Incident Log
On 28/11/2021, a raid on Site-250 was conducted by the Chaos Insurgency for unknown reasons. During this raid, an insurgent entered SCP-6231&#39;s containment chamber. The following is a log of the camera footage of the altercation.

&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-6231 finishes producing ice cream and jumps onto the insurgent, who is now approaching SCP-6231 and hands it to him with a note.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Insurgent:** &#34;Yummy Chocolate&#34; Yeah I&#39;m not eating this. 
&gt; 
&gt; //The insurgent drops the ice cream and leaves the room.//
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-6231 appears frightened from the insurgent&#39;s behavior and hops back into its terrarium.//

Hey, Matthews

As you most likely know, from our meeting the other day, SCP-6231 has been acting sluggish. This morning, it got worse. It&#39;s still reacting positively and making ice cream, but it isn&#39;t as active as it was before. It&#39;s lost a lot of weight too and isn&#39;t writing notes to staff. We&#39;ll try giving it some remedies for that disease that&#39;s been going around in the amphibian anomalies, but I just wanted to inform you what&#39;s happening beforehand, just in case things go south.

With regards, Avery.

**Addenum.6231.IX:**
On 05/03/2022, SCP-6231 was taken to Site-101&#39;s veterinarian because of its worsening condition. Dr. Cleo Ares determined that SCP-6231 had bacterial dermatosepticemia (commonly referred to as &#34;Red Leg Disease&#34;), a disease common in amphibians, which had been seen in other amphibian-based anomalies before. When given the proper treatment for it, SCP-6231&#39;s condition remained the same. This is because of SCP-6231&#39;s changed anatomy from that of a regular //Agalychnis callidryas//.

One day later, SCP-6231 was transferred into the Department of Fauna and Flora Anomaly Care unit of Site-101 and the following events transpired:

&gt; **Foreword:** The following events were recorded via surveillance cameras.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;** 6:09 AM
&gt; 
&gt; //Six researchers enter SCP-6231&#39;s room in the Fauna and Flora Anomaly Care unit and surround SCP-6231.//
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-6231 is visually distressed in its terrarium and is watching the researchers.//
&gt; 
&gt;  //Dr. Avery Cado enters the room and begins examining SCP-6231.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Cado:** The &#34;Red Leg Disease&#34; has gotten worse. We can try to do what we can, but at this point, we can&#39;t do much.
&gt; 
&gt;  //SCP-6231 is visually stressed and begins to slow its movements.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Chad:** Have we tried giving it some other remedies for it? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Cado:** No, we&#39;ve only tried three and I&#39;m afraid more will hurt it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Connor:** If it&#39;s going to die anyway, why not give it to help even if it might die?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Cado:** Unlike most people, I care if these guys die. Would you want to have a slow, painful death from the humans that contained you in the first place or be saved by them?
&gt;  
&gt; //Both the researchers are silent.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Cado:** Yeah, I thought so. Now, is there anyone else who has ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sandra:** Umm, what if we gave it some tetracycline. That&#39;s what normally treats frogs with &#34;Red Leg Disease&#34; correct?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Cado:** Good idea but, that could cause side effects that we don&#39;t want to risk affecting the frog. Anyone else?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-6231 looks like it is producing ice cream, although none of the researchers acknowledge this.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sanchez:** Have we taken into account what caused the disease?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Cado:** Yes- umm well, no. We don&#39;t know what caused it. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sanchez:** Have you even looked into that? That should&#39;ve been the main concern. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Cado:** I- err, did think about it, but never got approval from Site Director Matthews.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sanchez:** So you didn&#39;t.

&gt; **Closing Statement:** All cones of ice cream that were given to personnel had a small note embedded into them, labelled simply with &#34;Thank you&#34; on one side, and &#39;Goodbye&#39; on the other.
&gt; 

**Addendum.6231.X:**
After the events of Addendum.6231.IX, the Foundation was contacted by GoI-3776 &#34;Creature and Wildlife Protection Agency&#34; via email. The following is an email sent by an unknown CWPA member to Agent Hudson:

Hello Ronald, please share the following email with your superiors immediately. 

Hello, I am contacting you on behalf of the organization known as the Creature and Wildlife Protection Agency. You may know us through [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6922 Agent Lou], an agent of ours who is unfortunately in your containment. I have contacted you today to inform you of another agent of ours in your containment. Agent Sticks is a loyal member of our organization. Now, following Agent Sticks&#39; death, we would like to thank you for caring for him. He was the one that volunteered, knowing he wouldn&#39;t make it back, in one way or another. He had to say goodbye to his family and friends for the last time, and I know that must&#39;ve been difficult. He just wanted to make people happy with his ice cream. 

Now that we have gotten to know how your organization functions internally and your motives, we hope we can get on friendly terms. We will be contacting you again shortly for the conditions of these terms and to tell you a little bit about our past. Again, we and Sticks&#39; family would like to express our complete gratitude to you for caring for him. We hope our organizations can work together sometime in the near future. May Sticks rest in peace knowing that what he did wasn&#39;t for nothing.

Sincerely, Secretary Nuts
