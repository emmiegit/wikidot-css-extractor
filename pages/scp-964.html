**Item #:** SCP-964 
 
**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-964 is currently stored in a standard containment chamber at Site-45. Access to the object is prohibited for all personnel of Site-45 regardless of security level. In the event of a containment breach site security must evacuate all compromised sectors, contact Site-11, and await arrival of MTF teams tasked with object&#39;s recontainment. Site-45 staff that came in contact with SCP-964 must be processed according to protocol 964Δ6h. If number of affected personnel exceeds 20%, or protocol 964Δ6h cannot be enacted, SCP-964 must be relocated to another Site immediately.

Research on SCP-964 must be conducted remotely, using suitable Foundation facilities located at least 200 km from the Site currently housing the object. All interactions with SCP-964 related materials must be done according to protocol 964Δ6d. All documentation on SCP-964 must be transferred into digital format weekly, and hard copies subsequently incinerated. All digital data must be processed according to protocol 964Δ6r once every two weeks.

**Description:** SCP-964 is a prototype of a next-generation active camouflage system, developed by ███████████████ under a contract with the U.S. DoD. The object was recovered in 2004 from a ███████████████ facility near ███████, Nebraska.

SCP-964 displays the ability to reconstruct itself on the atomic level. This reconstruction process can take up to 16 hours and causes a complete change of the object&#39;s appearance, physical properties and chemical composition. The result is usually a solid, commonly-encountered object weighing between 2 and 100 kg and not displaying dangerous or anomalous properties. In rare cases, high-energy, radioactive or explosive objects, unenclosed fluids, living entities and objects with mass up to 65 tons have been observed. Although the new reconstruction can be theoretically postponed indefinitely, SCP-964 has not remained stable for more than two weeks since its containment by the SCP Foundation.

SCP-964 will initiate the reconstruction process whenever it &#34;detects&#34; permanent data related to its current manifestation. This encompasses all known data formats and storage mediums, including text, photographic materials, encrypted digital data and human long-term memory. This reaction can be delayed by increasing the medium&#39;s complexity and distance from SCP-964. While no method of completely stopping this phenomenon has been found so far, protocols 964Δ6a-r proved mostly successful in minimizing the dangers it can represent to on-site personnel.

**Incident Report 964-11:** On 22/09/2006, the message &#34;SCP-964 exists&#34; was used to trigger reconstruction process as part of scheduled testing in object&#39;s self-preservation mechanisms. After the start of reconstruction object was observed to rapidly lose mass, until it completely disintegrated. SCP-964 was subsequently reclassified as neutralized. Two months after the incident, a series of accidents suggesting SCP-964 involvement was reported in ████, Sweden. Object successfully recontained.

**Incident Report 964-23:** On 15/01/2008 after a typical reconstruction process, SCP-964, at the time contained at Site-30, turned into approximately 50 liters of an unidentified acidic solution. SCP-964 melted the floor of its containment chamber and proceeded to leak through maintenance shafts until it initiated new reconstruction process in a corridor four levels below. Site-30 security was dispatched to the site of the incident. After their arrival, close proximity to several video recorders caused SCP-964 to undergo a rapid series of transformations, culminating with a 20-m-diameter sphere of high-temperature plasma. SCP-964 was subsequently found in the debris, manifested as a 2-m-tall stuffed toy bear, and relocated to another Site.

**Addendum 964a:** In light of incident 964-23, personnel of the Site housing SCP-964 are no longer allowed access to documentation related to the object or to the object itself. Information included in transfer documents must be replaced with document 964-R. Document 964-R must classify SCP-964 as a Keter-level object and contain a fabricated description of the object composed from the properties most likely to cause a containment breach in event they are displayed by SCP-964.
