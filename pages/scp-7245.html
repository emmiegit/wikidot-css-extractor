**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7245 is allowed to continue her duties on-site. Instances of SCP-7245-1 are to be relocated to Site-99&#39;s arboreal wing where they are treated accordingly. Staff wishing to personally acquire said specimens may do so with written permission from SCP-7245 herself.

**Description:** SCP-7245 is Dr. Charlotte D&#39;Amore, assistant lead of Site-99&#39;s Botanic Department, who is subject to the manifestation of SCP-7245-1.

Instances of SCP-7245-1 refer to unique strands of flora that sprout throughout Dr. D&#39;Amore&#39;s body, mainly  from the back of her head, her arms and wrists, as well as the area above her chest. Those who are exposed to SCP-7245-1 undergo certain memetic effects, which include:

* An increased pulse and breathing rate;
* An increase in body temperature;
* Slight dizziness and flushing of cheeks;
* A sudden surge of motivation, and;
* A &#39;sweet&#39; tasting sensation.

These qualities intensify when nearing SCP-7245&#39;s proximity. It should also be noted that Dr. D&#39;Amore is the only individual who is exempt from SCP-7245-1&#39;s anomalous properties.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Interviewer:** Researcher Gerald Smith
**Interviewee:** SCP-7245
**Date:** 5^^th^^ June 2022

**Foreword:** The following interview serves to possibly discern any correlation that can be discovered between each SCP-7245-1 manifestation. This footage takes place within Dr. D&#39;Amore&#39;s office space.

**[BEGIN LOG]**

//SCP-7245 and Rsr. Smith are seated beside one another on a couch, the former fixated on the vase of SCP-7245-1 instances (pictured above) situated on the desk&#39;s corner while the latter is tampering with the recording device.//

**Smith:** Alright, it&#39;s on.

**SCP-7245:** Huh? Oh, yeah. Cool.

//Smith sets his clipboard on his lap and briefly skims through the notes attached.//

**Smith:** This is Interview Log number 7245 dash five. Speaking is Researcher Gerald Smith, here with Dr. Charlotte D&#39;Amore, aka SCP-7245. We&#39;ll be discussing the usual, and hopefully we can find a causation for her anomaly. Are you ready, D&#39;Amore?

**SCP-7245:** Mhm...

**Smith:** Okay, great. Let&#39;s just start with a simple &#39;how are you&#39;?

**SCP-7245:** Uh, it&#39;s going well for the most part. Been deep in thought lately.

**Smith:** Is that something to be concerned about?

//SCP-7245 crosses her arms.//

**SCP-7245:** No, my head&#39;s in the clouds. That&#39;s all.

//An SCP-7245-1 instance sprouts from above her foot, falling to the ground.//

**Smith:** Alright. Well, has there been any developments on your front? Any theories or maybe even guesses that are circling your mind? It doesn&#39;t have to be anything concrete.

**SCP-7245:** I don&#39;t… it&#39;s nothing.

**Smith:** That doesn&#39;t sound like &#34;nothing&#34;.

**SCP-7245:** Heh, sure it doesn&#39;t.

//A pause.//

**Smith:** //(Inhales deeply)// Right, let&#39;s just continue. Have you had any difficulties with your flowers? Apart from the usual inconveniences, that is.

**SCP-7245:** Difficulties? I wouldn&#39;t say there&#39;s —

//Another SCP-7245-1 sprouts from her wrist. SCP-7245 attempts to hide it.//

**SCP-7245:** — no, everything&#39;s fine. Yeah, all good.

**Smith:** Are you sure?

//More instances of SCP-7245-1 grow from her wrist.//

**SCP-7245:** Yes, couldn&#39;t be better, honestly.

//SCP-7245 hastily sweeps the flowers beside the couch. A longer period of silence follows between both people.//

**SCP-7245:** Aren&#39;t you gonna continue with the interview?

**Smith:** Oh, I would, if it weren&#39;t for you constantly brushing your plants away like I&#39;m blind. You think I wouldn&#39;t notice?

**SCP-7245:** I mean, it must be a bother, yeah? I&#39;m just doing some spring cleaning.

**Smith:** Charlotte, what&#39;s with the sudden attitude? Where&#39;s your usual chatty self?

**SCP-7245:** I just don&#39;t feel as chatty right now. No idea what you&#39;re talking about.

**Smith:** You&#39;ve done nothing but stare at that vase while we&#39;ve been talking.

//SCP-7245 swiftly faces Smith.//

**SCP-7245:** Like I said, I&#39;m just a little lost in thought. I&#39;m just not used to being a walking garden.

**Smith:** D&#39;Amore, it&#39;s been months since this anomaly has surfaced. Recently, it feels as if you&#39;ve been exposed to some secondary effect.

**SCP-7245:** What makes you say that?

**Smith:** You&#39;re more jumpy, you lose focus during conversations and meetings. The documents you&#39;ve sent me contain various mistakes as well. 

//Smith sets aside his clipboard.//

**Smith:** Be honest with me here. Is this the anomaly disrupting you?

//SCP-7245 puts on a strained expression.//

**SCP-7245:** No, it&#39;s not. It&#39;s too embarrassing.

**Smith:** How so?

**SCP-7245:** What do you think? Have you not read my file?

**Smith:** What exactly are you implying?

**SCP-7245:** The increase in heartbeat, the light-headedness, the sudden urge to get up and do shit just to distract yourself. I&#39;m in love, Gerry. This is infatuation.

//Smith lowers his eyebrows, thinking.//

**Smith:** Oh, really?

**SCP-7245:** Yeah, I&#39;m surprised you&#39;re the first to realize that. Though, I wasn&#39;t doing myself many favors either. This is just //(chuckles)//… this is stupid.

**Smith:** How come you didn&#39;t tell any of us? If you knew.

**SCP-7245:** Because I didn&#39;t want to believe it myself. When the thought first came through, I figured it was illogical, just ridiculous. I mean, who would come to //that// conclusion, am I right?

//SCP-7245 stares at the vase.//

**SCP-7245:** But when I thought about it, it all suddenly clicked. It was so simple. I wasn&#39;t exempt from those flowers&#39; properties; those were my feelings shot through the petals.

//SCP-7245 takes a deep breath.//

**SCP-7245:** I don&#39;t know. I guess I was just too scared to consider it. Who would&#39;ve thought an anomaly can sprout from circumstances as small as these.

//Smith leans back into the couch as SCP-7245 blinks several times.//

**Smith:** So, what are you going to do then?

//SCP-7245 scratches her neck.//

**SCP-7245:** //(Sighs)// Fuck it, I might as well rip the bandaid. It&#39;s either that or suffer a fate of a thousand flowers. Whatever happens, happens.

//Smith puts a hand on SCP-7245&#39;s shoulder. She turns to him.//

**Smith:** I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be just fine. I&#39;ll be willing to help out however I can.

**SCP-7245:** Thanks… if that&#39;s the case, would you mind authorizing a test for me?

= **Addendum-2:** Experiment Log
----

On the 6^^th^^ of June 2022, an experiment concerning SCP-7245 was conducted to confirm Dr. D&#39;Amore&#39;s assumption for the cause of her anomaly. For the sake of the test, Dr. April Mandana[[footnote]]An on-site counsellor for personnel and sapient entities alike.[[/footnote]] was asked to partake in said experiment. The contents below detail the events that follow.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**[BEGIN LOG]**

//SCP-7245 stands facing the wall, occasionally scratching herself on the arm and neck. She stands perfectly still when hearing the entrance open.//

**Mandana:** Hello? Oh!

//Dr. Mandana enters the experiment room and notices SCP-7245 standing near the corner. She closes the door behind her as she glances at the observation window, with a confused expression on her face.//

**Mandana:** Good day, Charlotte. I didn&#39;t know you&#39;d be here too. Mr. Smith called me here for a test, but said he couldn&#39;t elaborate. Could this be related to your anomaly?

//SCP-7245 inhales deeply as a -1 instance falls to the ground.//

**SCP-7245:** It&#39;s great to see you, April. How&#39;s work handling yo — How&#39;re you handling work? All good on that end?

**Mandana:** It&#39;s going swimmingly as usual. Faces old and new, topics as interesting as ever.

**SCP-7245:** That&#39;s nice, that&#39;s nice.

//Pause.//

**SCP-7245:** I know you might be a bit perplexed but, um… //(mutters)// god, I don&#39;t know how to do this sort of thing.

**Mandana:** What do you mean?

**SCP-7245:** I&#39;m literally ridiculing myself in front of the camera. Someone&#39;s gonna look over this and write all this shit down, and a lot more people are gonna read this and laugh. I could&#39;ve done this as simply as just telling you but I&#39;m putting on this whole act to seem cool. What am I doing?

**Mandana:** I… I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re trying to say, but you shouldn&#39;t discourage yourself like that, Charlotte. You&#39;re a very wonderful woman and the times I&#39;ve spoken with you are quite enjoyable. You were so kind to me when I first got here and I mean it.

**SCP-7245:** Ah, there you go again, April. You never change, do you?

**Mandana:** Hm? Where is this —

//Numerous instances of SCP-7245-1 begin sprouting from SCP-7245&#39;s body, startling Mandana.//

**SCP-7245:** The countless compliments and words of endearment, that smile you always have when we talk, how you pay attention to everything I have to say, down to every little detail. And on top of that, you have this radiating sincerity that just… it fucks me up every time I think about it.

//Mandana widens her eyes in surprise.//

**Mandana:** Charlotte, I&#39;m surprised to hear tha —

//SCP-7245 covers her cheeks with her hands.//

**SCP-7245:** I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve noticed this but I&#39;ve been looking your way more and more since I fell into this whole predicament. I almost didn&#39;t realize it until I connected the dots. Every time I look at you, it keeps me moving or something. This is my first time saying this shit, okay? Don&#39;t judge.

**Mandana:** //(Looks away)// Alright, you don&#39;t have to tell me any mo —

//SCP-7245 tilts her head to the side.//

**SCP-7245:** But even now, I&#39;m doubting myself. Even when I filed for this experiment —

**Mandana:** //(Turns back)// Charlotte.

 **SCP-7245:** — even when I got Gerry to help with this high-school-level cringe fest —

**Mandana:** //Charlotte.//

**SCP-7245:** — even when I get flustered over every time you spotted me a drink from that one coffee spot I&#39;m a sucker for. I want one last confirmation, just to be sure what I&#39;m saying&#39;s from the… from the —

**Mandana:** //(Shouts) Charlotte!//

//SCP-7245 stops.//

**Mandana:** I didn&#39;t… I didn&#39;t know you felt that way. That was a lot to take in, all those emotions you decided to dump on me. You&#39;re going to make me melt from doing that, you know?

//Mandana looks to her side.//

**Mandana:** Actually, I&#39;ve been going through the same experience, probably ever since I&#39;ve met you. The way you treat me and everyone else I know with such vibrancy and respect. Before long, I found myself viewing you more… differently.

**SCP-7245:** You did?

**Mandana:** Yes. And I figured I&#39;d want to return the favor by becoming someone that feels worthy of being by your side, so I&#39;ve been approaching you steadily and building our relationship.

//Mandana straightens her posture.//

**Mandana:** Why do you think I remember what coffee you like to drink? Down to the specifics? I was hoping I could get a chance at being more than just mere acquaintances.

//Mandana lets out a sigh of relief.//

**Mandana:** I&#39;m just thrilled you feel the same way, Charlotte.

//SCP-7245 stutters repeatedly.//

**SCP-7245:** R-Really?

**Mandana:** Really really.

//Pause.//

**SCP-7245:** You know what? I&#39;m just gonna turn around.

//SCP-7245 turns and faces Mandana, who has her palms on her chest. Suddenly, a spontaneous burst of SCP-7245-1 instances sprout from all across her body, almost covering a significant portion of her.//

**SCP-7245:** Yeah, I guess that&#39;s it then.

**Mandana:** //(Grins)// Is it now?

//SCP-7245 stares at the ground, attempting to hide her face with the -1 instances.//

**SCP-7245:** …April, I //fucking// love you.

Good evening, Researcher Smith.

You are cordially invited to Charlotte and April D&#39;Amore&#39;s wedding on the 6^^th^^ of June 2024. Make sure you come in with appropriate attire and bring in some food for the afterparty if you&#39;d like. You are allowed to bring a plus one for the occasion, but bring twice the amount of food if you&#39;re going to do that.

On a side note, though: Thank you for listening to my stupid self from back then. I&#39;ve never been this happy in my entire life and I owe you one for that. Being with her is a blessing among blessings.

I hope I can see you there!
