{{I observed a noticeable uptick in events this week. So noticeable that I thought it too reckless to not report in early.}}

{{There were four events. All involved two people or fewer, but I couldn&#39;t catch any names.}}

{{The first was on Monday. It was early in the morning, before sunrise, and I was stationed on the corner of Grand and Multnomah. An older man in a suit came walking down the street from the West, and he stopped near me.}}

{{I was very still, and my act was working, and I don&#39;t think he noticed that I was a person. He took out his phone, and I caught a glance over his shoulder of what he was typing. I could pick out &#34;can&#39;t be the Foundation&#34;, and Foundation was capitalized. Do we know of a Foundation?}}

{{The man had a gun on his belt, but I don&#39;t think he was a police officer. He didn&#39;t stay long.}}

{{The second event was Wednesday night. I was down Broadway street, by the veterinarian. Two men walked by, and they were arguing. I froze up, kept my pose, I don&#39;t think they noticed.}}

{{The taller one was saying that they couldn&#39;t do what they were doing, that they were going to end up caught, and then they wouldn&#39;t even get to remember what they did so wrong.}}

{{The smaller man shushed him. Said no, the plan will work, and the reward will be worth it. Portlands will remember us well. And he said [[[three-portlands-hub|Portlands, specifically, plural]]]. Is that significant? But they were gone before I could hear anything else.}}

{{The remaining two encounters were on Friday. The first was in the early evening, when it was just dark enough for my act to be most effective. I was by the big parking lot on Halsey. A group of two, a woman and a large person in a suit. The woman sat down on a bench, not ten paces from me.}}

{{She sounded angry. &#34;I just don&#39;t see why we&#39;re still going through with this,&#34; she said. &#34;I&#39;ve done my part for our partnership, and I know he must be happy.&#34; Emphasis on &#34;he&#34;. &#34;We&#39;re in such a fucking rut now,&#34; she said.}}

{{The other person didn&#39;t reply. Out of the corner of my eye I peeked at them, and they didn&#39;t have any eyes behind their sunglasses. Just empty sockets. Unusual.}}

{{&#34;Fine,&#34; she said. &#34;Let&#39;s just get out of here.&#34; She pushed herself to her feet and stomped off, the suited person following behind.}}

{{Later that night, I was waiting for a bus to take me home, right across the intersection from the Taco Bell. I was still wearing my makeup, but I wasn&#39;t trying to hide.}}

{{The exact same woman came up next to me and started waiting. She wasn&#39;t attentive, she was trying to light up a cigarette. I offered a greeting, and she yelped, dropping the smoke. She muttered some obscenity and turned to leave.}}

{{I watched her go across the street, into the parking lot of that Chipotle. When I was sure she had stopped watching behind her, I followed.}}

{{She turned around a corner in the parking lot, but when I reached the corner, she was gone. I glanced around the parking lot, but she was nowhere to be found.}}

{{I realize now that every group I encountered this week was walking in the general direction of the Chipotle when I lost sight.}}

{{I would very much like to investigate the Chipotle parking lot further. Please provide me with further instructions.}}

{{As well, my compliments on the chalupas. They are always a sublime experience.}}

{{Best,}}
