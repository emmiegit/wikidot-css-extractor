**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment of SCP-6525 is currently infeasible. An O5 consensus regarding SCP-6525 is underway.

**Description:** SCP-6525 is the designation given to a CK Class Reality Restructuring Event as initially reported by O5-5. Various individuals across the globe report similar experiences and consistently state that SCP-6525 took place on the 25/05/1998.

As of time of writing, the effects of SCP-6525 on our reality are not entirely understood, but is believed to have altered nature and the laws of science significantly.

**Addendum:** SCP-6525 Project

Several days following the emergence of SCP-6525, O5-5 initiated the SCP-6525 Project (named Constantinople) with unanimous O5 approval. The SCP-6525 Project saw the halt of all non-essential Foundation operations and recruited personnel from various departments such as the Temporal Anomalies Department and the Reality Phenomena Division. 

The following are excerpts taken from the project proposal.

+++ Project Details:

Project Constantinople will encompass nearly all Foundation operations, requiring each Overseer to cooperate and act in unison with the Project Lead, O5-5. Three major areas of concern to Project &#39;Constantinople&#39; are outlined as follows:

# **Containment:** Due to the inherently anomalous and widespread effects of SCP-6525, containment or neutralization must take place imminently. Personnel from varying departments, including the new divisions created as a result of SCP-6525, have been recruited to ascertain the nature of SCP-6525 and devise a method of containing, reverting or erasing SCP-6525 from our plane of reality. 
# **Information Control:** Personnel of varying departments and levels, along with members of the general public, reportedly maintain their memory of SCP-6525 occurring. Global efforts must be taken to ensure that SCP-6525 remains hidden and forgotten so as to maintain the veil of normalcy. Investigation and interventions of GOI knowledge of SCP-6525 will also take place.
# **Research:** In order to aid in the containment sector of Project Constantinople, a separate Research Area has been devised. The purpose of this research team is to investigate and analyze the effects of SCP-6525 on our reality and to ascertain what is anomalous or not - for this purpose, the Site-01 Database and all Deepwell Servers have been unlocked for the research team&#39;s use, in order to compare our current state of reality to our prior one.

**Addendum:** O5-5 Audio Logs

Due to his experience with SCP-6525 and the work from Project Constantinople, the O5 Council assigned Site-93 Therapist Gabrielle Lobachevsky to O5-5. The following is a series of personal recordings made by O5-5 as part of therapy, and was uploaded per his request. Despite being irrelevant, O5-5&#39;s requests to submit his logs were approved in order to improve his morale.


&gt; = **VIDEO LOG ONE**
&gt; ----
&gt; **DATE:** 02/06/1998
&gt; 
&gt; **NOTE:** The following recording is the first part of a series of diary entries created by O5-5. The recording took place in O5-5&#39;s residence in ██████████, ██████. 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** //The recording begins, showing O5-5 sitting at a mahogany desk. Warm lighting dominates, but does not eliminate, the view of the background. Various furniture and decoration can be seen. O5-5 sighs, visibly slumping in his seat.//
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** &#34;The O5 have decided I need a therapist.&#34; //O5-5 rests a hand on his head and brushes his hair back, avoiding eye contact with the camera.// &#34;It&#39;s only been a few days since the 6525 Project kicked off - now I need a therapist?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** //Leaning forward, O5-5 clasps his hands together and stares into the camera lens.// 
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** &#34;My main concern isn&#39;t about 6525. It&#39;s this god damn...&#34; //O5-5 whispers and glances aside,// &#34;Family.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** &#34;I mean... Fuck!&#34; //O5-5&#39;s voice increases in volume.// &#34;One day you&#39;re a twenty year old guy cooking a barbecue and the next...?&#34; //Another sigh.//
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** &#34;I should give some context, right? Gabrielle said that I can keep these private, but I&#39;ll upload this to the main file anyway. Annoying bitch. Maybe if the others know I&#39;m doing fine, they&#39;ll let me off and be at peace.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** &#34;Okay so, everything started on the 25th. I had a nice barbecue going but I was a real dumb fuck because I forgot my tongs.&#34; //For a moment, the Overseer is quiet and rests a hand on his chin. He looks down before continuing,// &#34;I think somewhere around then it happened. It was around two o&#39;clock - this... Sickly yellowish colour appeared everywhere, coming from this ugly blue sky. And- And god, the green. Green. Everywhere.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** &#34;And my face too, it was... It //is// old as fuck.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** &#34;But like I said, the worst part was what was waiting for me outside.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Child:** Daddy, who are you talking to-?
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** //Suddenly, O5-5 jolts up in his seat and turns to face the origin of the voice, which is feminine and childish. He glances down, and seethes in anger.// &#34;Didn&#39;t I tell you not to come in here? You little shit!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Child:** //Silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** &#34;I said get out!&#34; //Sniffling is heard before a door abruptly slams shut. The Overseer groans and swindles his chair so as to face the camera again.// &#34;That. Is the worst part.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** &#34;Apparently I have a family now.&#34; //O5-5 wipes his face with his hands.// &#34;Dammit.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** &#34;Wait, kiddo, come back!&#34; //O5-5 exits the frame and can be heard conversing with the child for several minutes.//
&gt; 
&gt; //The record is silent for another 4 minutes before the camera deactivates automatically.//

&gt; **DATE:** 22/06/1998
&gt; 
&gt; **NOTE:** At this point in time, Project Constantinople was facing trouble with research and investigations. This resulted in an outburst from O5-5, who was then sent home on mandatory leave for two days.
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** //The recording starts up with O5-5 leaning into the desk and towards the camera. Signs of exhaustion are visible on the Overseer&#39;s face.//
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** &#34;The project isn&#39;t going anywhere.&#34; //O5-5 sighs and sinks into his chair further.// &#34;Our biggest theories yet are a temporal anomaly, rapid biological skip or a reality shift. Could be any or all three.&#34; //O5-5 slams the desk in anger.// &#34;My team is fucking hopeless. &#39;Best of the best&#39;, Seven told me.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Meanwhile, I&#39;ve managed to figure out my wife&#39;s name: Mavis. And my kids are, uh, John, Jared, Hailey and Raya. Looks like the wifey and I had a lot of sex or something. Assuming that this is a time thing, and not a figment of our imagination.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** &#34;Honestly, they&#39;re a bunch of weirdos... I&#39;ve been spending some time trying to get to know them. I&#39;ve written down their birthdays and, er, I have some recordings and photos of special days so I have a better picture of their personalities and- Oh shit.&#34; //Footsteps are heard in the distance, and knocking ensues.// &#34;Yes?&#34; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Mavis █████:** //The door opens,// &#34;Sorry about last night. I know work has been hard-&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** &#34;Hey. Hey, it&#39;s fine. Are... //You// alright? You look like you&#39;ve been treading on thin ice.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Mavis █████:** &#34;I&#39;m okay, ███. Just... Come down for dinner please.&#34; //Mavis appears on camera, glancing down at O5-5. She grasps his hands with her own.// &#34;The kids feel left out. Please just...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** &#34;Okay. I&#39;m coming down, and maybe we can watch a movie together?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Mavis █████:** &#34;They&#39;d like that.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** &#34;Well, yeah, but for us too. It&#39;s... Our anniversary after all!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Mavis █████:** //She smiles,// &#34;You remembered.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** //The Overseer chuckles and stands, using a hand to lift the camera. After some movement, the camera is seen resting at his side.// &#34;Of course; why would I forget our... //Special day?//. I&#39;m just going to clean up quickly, you go ahead. The kids have probably destroyed the TV or something by now.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Mavis █████:** &#34;... Okay.&#34; //The two smile at each other before Mavis exits.// 
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-5:** //Silence commences for a few seconds before a drawn out groan is released.// &#34;God this is so fucking hard. Let&#39;s hope the team figures something out soon.&#34; //O5-5 motions to disable the recording device.//
