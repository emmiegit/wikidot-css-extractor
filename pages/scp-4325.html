**Item #:** SCP-4325

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation web crawlers are to search internet forums and social media sites for accounts of SCP-4325 and its effects. If an individual is found to have been afflicted with SCP-4325, they are to be located and sent to a Foundation quarantine facility, with staff to record the individual&#39;s symptoms and to check if SCP-4325 is present in their retina. If the symptom is unique enough to be classed as a variation of SCP-4325, it is to be recorded in Log-4325-A.

Foundation front companies are to raise awareness and encourage research of &#34;visual snow&#34;, as to help distinguish it from SCP-4325&#39;s anomalous effects. 

**Description:** SCP-4325 is an anomalous phenomenon and affliction that primarily affects those with the condition known as &#34;visual snow&#34;, in which the user&#39;s vision displays a light amount of &#39;static&#39;, akin to a poorly tuned analogue television [See Log-4325-A for more information regarding symptoms].

When SCP-4325 has infested and activated within an individual (now designated SCP-4325-1), their vision will begin to be overtaken by static. Within 3 hours of being afflicted, SCP-4325-1&#39;s vision will be completely overridden, leading to a complete loss of normal function within the eyes[[footnote]]One variation: SCP-4325-BW, did not display these properties until 2 weeks after manifestation.[[/footnote]]. Tests have shown that only the subject&#39;s vision is affected, and other senses such as hearing and touch are not normally affected, although those with tinnitus report hearing noise akin to a radio tuned to a non-existent station.

Individuals affected by the main anomalous symptom of SCP-4325 (plain animated static) also report visual hallucinations of seemingly random objects and entities within the static. Analysis of these reports indicate that these hallucinations are caused by SCP-4325-1&#39;s mind, and not an anomalous effect of SCP-4325 itself. During physical examinations, symptoms of SCP-4325 have been found within the retina of the subject&#39;s eye. To date, every infected individual has displayed this property.

&gt; **Interviewed:** D-98523
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Ellis Darling
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** D-98523 complained of &#34;bad eyesight&#34; at approximately 8 am. He then began to yell for personnel at 12:03 pm, screaming about how his vision has completely decayed.
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ellis:** So, what exactly do you see, with your...condition?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-98523:** Don&#39;t you know what visual snow is, man? I mean, it&#39;s pretty damn obvious.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Dr. Ellis:** I may be a scientist, but I am not familiar with the condition, no. Can you describe it?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-98523:** Well, in short, it&#39;s like looking through broken eyes. You think it&#39;s all normal, you think everyone else has it. But then it starts getting worse, and eventually you can&#39;t see anything anymore, except for one thing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ellis:** What&#39;s that one thing?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-98523:** Static, man. I feel like a broken tv.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** D-98523 refused to answer more questions. Research into classification as an anomaly is ongoing.

&gt; **Interviewed:** Researcher Miles Dean
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Ellis Darling
&gt; 
&gt; ------------
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ellis:** You called me! What happened?
&gt; 
&gt; **Miles:** I don&#39;t know! I was just sitting in the break room and I saw the tv was off. When I went to check it, my vision just... changed.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Dr. Ellis:** Changed how, Miles?
&gt; 
&gt; **Miles:** What do you mean how? Can&#39;t you see it in my eyes? It&#39;s as plain as night and day.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; (//Miles holds his head in his hands//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Miles:** I... I can&#39;t see colour.
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Unique variation of SCP-4325 is to be now classed as SCP-4325-RW.

&gt; **Interviewed:** Romeo Richards 
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Ellis Darling
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ellis:** You&#39;ve made quite a number of posts on [REDACTED] about your &#39;special&#39; condition. Would you mind describing it to me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Romeo:** Sure, what else do I have to lose? Can&#39;t see shit anymore. All I see now is just text, floating.
&gt; 
&gt;  **Dr. Ellis:** Text? Like floating words?
&gt; 
&gt; **Romeo:** Yes, that text! Can&#39;t you see it? It&#39;s everywhere, on the walls, the ceiling, my wife&#39;s face, you name it! It&#39;s here right now...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ellis:** Wait, right now? What does it say, Romeo?
&gt; 
&gt; **Romeo:** &#34;No signal.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Shortly after the interview, Romeo&#39;s vision went to include colour bars used to test North American analogue televisions. Unique variation of SCP-4325 is to be now classed as SCP-4325-NW.

&gt; **Interviewed:** Kim Murray 
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Ellis Darling
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Kim was detained shortly after an altercation at the Indian Casino ██████, shouting about the &#34;Black and White Indian Curse&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ellis:** I&#39;m here to just ask a few questions regarding your videos on [REDACTED] about your &#39;special&#39; condition. Would you mind describing it to me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Kim:** I thought you watched them, though?  
&gt; 
&gt;  **Dr. Ellis:** I did, I just need your statement for the hospital.
&gt; 
&gt; **Kim:** Alright, whatever you say. The only thing I can say, is that it&#39;s an Indian head.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ellis:** Indian head? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Kim:** Yeah, that. I&#39;ve been cursed by that thing! Black and white Native American cross hair bullshit...
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ellis:** Actually, I think I may have something, hold on.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; (//Dr. Ellis pulls up a series of cards, each with a different picture. Kim looks through them for a moment before freezing up. She points to one of the cards with an expression of fear.//)
&gt;

&gt; ||||~ Variation SCP-4325-BW. ||
&gt; [[/div]]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Kim:** That card! The Indian black and white one! That&#39;s it!
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** The image that Kim referred to was the &#34;Indian-head test pattern&#34;, used by the RCA until the introduction of Digital Television in 2009. This unique variation of SCP-4325 is to be classed as SCP-4325-BW. Contrary to other variations of SCP-4325, the manifestation of static and complete vision loss did not occur until approximately 2 weeks after symptoms manifested.

&gt; **Interviewed:** Steve Jackson 
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Ellis Darling
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ellis:** Hello Mr. Jackson, I&#39;m Ellis. I&#39;m here to ask a few questions about your &#34;thing&#34;. Are you able to do that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Steve:** Oh, I would love to Miss! Thank you so much for asking!  
&gt; 
&gt;  **Dr. Ellis:** No problem, Mr. Jackson.
&gt; 
&gt; **Steve:** Right. If I can remember correctly, it started shortly after my 95th birthday, and I was pretty sure it was just a dream. But when I saw it in real life let me tell you, I was pretty shocked!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ellis:** Shocked for what, Mr. Jackson?
&gt; 
&gt; **Steve**: I, uh, saw this image, an image of a little girl with a clown. You remember those things? They had the colours and that picture when the channels went down? All I could see was that, but then I saw...and I saw...
&gt; 
&gt; (//Mr. Jackson remained silent for the rest of the interview. He was admitted to the ████ hospital shortly after.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** This unique variation of SCP-4325 is to be classed as SCP-4325-TW. Further monitoring of Steve Jackson will be implemented in the event of this variation of SCP-4325 changing.

**Addendum:** During a routine physical examination of a user infected with SCP-4325 on ██/██/████, a variation of SCP-4325-TW was found. Along with the subject&#39;s retina displaying Test Card W, a block of text with the words &#34;COME ON&#34; flashed numerous times. The subject then reported a noise akin to multiple objects shattering, with what seemed to be an individual sobbing.

These developments have led to ongoing efforts to identify and contain the source of SCP-4325, if one exists.
