A box of spare parts makes it through a security check. Later on, some of those parts are used to create a makeshift containment device.

Deep inside of the machine, a single airtight seal breaks.

&#34;Man, that thing&#39;s really banging around in there, isn&#39;t it?&#34;

&#34;Yeah, it seems to be trying to increase its momentum to break out of the capsule. Probably nothing to worry about, but try turning on the air cycler the guys in engineering rigged up, see if you can disorient it.&#34;

Researcher Bridge once again skimmed over the provisional SCP report which had been sent to the Greyberries of herself and every other person with the clearance at Site-19.

&#34;Gas cloud... can manipulate its own momentum... colorless... can be identified by a faint odor of caramel... inhalation by humans causes irrational and violent behavior... &#34; She looked up at the guard in front of her in shocked disbelief. &#34;This thing caused all of this?&#34;

&#34;Ye-yup,&#34; the guard replied as he finished covering the air vent. &#34;At least, it started with one. My guess is that it was able to contaminate a few of the other skips, not to mention what happened when it got into the D-Class barracks. Anyway, hopefully that&#39;ll keep the gas from getting in through the vents, and that desk should keep the door from giving as easily.&#34;

&#34;So, what do we do now.&#34;

&#34;We wait until someone gets here and gets this breach under control.&#34;

And so, they waited in silence. When the silence grew too heavy, they exchanged stories. Once their stories ran out, they again waited in silence.

&#34;Hey Doc, wanna know something funny.&#34; The guard asked as he began to giggle.

&#34;What?&#34;

&#34;One of us could die in this room, and no one would ever know. We would just be another statistic on a damage report. Isn&#39;t that hilarious?!&#34;

Researcher Bridge spun her head around to face the guard. He had a wide grin on his face and a firearm aimed at her chest. Panic and realization hit her like a wall of ice.

&#34;Hey Doc, do you smell candy?&#34;

There was a flash and a bang.

&#34;That felt good,&#34; thought the guard as he began to push the desk out of the way. &#34;I think I&#39;ll try it again.&#34;

Pete from memetics dove for cover. He wasn&#39;t sure who the guard shooting at him was, but one thing was apparent; whoever they were, they were shooting at him.

Pete wasn&#39;t sure what to do, he wasn&#39;t trained to deal with this. Needed someone to deal with text-based entities who could burn you to a crisp and were afraid of clowns? Fine. A non-existent country which was spread by a phrase? Bring it on! All the staff and anomalies of Site-19? Nope, not a chance.

Pete began to wrack his brain for something to help him as his assailant continued to get closer. There had to be something that he knew that he could use to his advantage. Something to cancel out a mind-alteration or shortwire his opponent&#39;s brain.

Then something in his head went &#39;click.&#39;

Pete from memetics began to shout at the top of his lungs; &#34;Does the black moo-&#34;

And then there wasn&#39;t enough Pete left to continue shouting.

&gt; **From: AIC Alexandra**
&gt; **To: O5 Command**
&gt; **Re: Site-19 Breach Update**
&gt;
&gt; The last unaffected staff member, Peter Edwards, has been confirmed deceased. On-site warheads have been disabled by an unknown party. Approximately 83% of on-site anomalies have breached containment. Six known anomalies have escaped Site-19. Please see attached documents for further statistics. Awaiting orders.

O5-1 reviewed the pictures of what used to be North America. Sites-19, 17, and a few dozen other strategic points lost. The reset button lying in pieces. Titans battling it out for the apocalypse.

O5-1 turned to his fellow counsel members.

&#34;Gentlemen, I&#39;m afraid to say that the Foundation has failed. We have failed.&#34;
