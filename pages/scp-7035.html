SCP-7035&#39;s containment class is currently in review. When SCP-7035-POND instances manifested and their locations were found, temporary facilities were set up to guard the perimeter surrounding them. 

However, after the demanifestations of SCP-7035-POND instances, there is no longer a pathway to SCP-7035-ELYSIUM. A request to reform SCP-7035&#39;s containment class to NEUTRALIZED or KETER is currently in discussion.

------

SCP-7035 refers to the culmination of three anomalies: SCP-7035-POND, SCP-7035-ELYSIUM, and SCP-7035-MOTHER.

**[A]**: SCP-7035-POND instances are cylindrical holes containing water. Their diameters are not the same across each instance with multiple variations, ranging from 5 meters to 37 meters. The volume of SCP-7035-POND instances is currently indeterminate. Any attempt to drain water from SCP-7035-POND instances has seemingly resulted in no change in their water levels.

Additionally, SCP-7035-POND instances appear to be spatial anomalies, connecting our dimension to another that is currently dubbed as SCP-7035-ELYSIUM. The exact mechanisms of this transportation are not well understood, but researchers theorize that going deep enough into an instance of SCP-7035-POND results in transportation.

Multiple instances of SCP-7035-POND spontaneously manifested on March 16th, 2099; furthermore, the locations of these instances have been found in the major city of every country that has access to communication devices.

Due to the spontaneous demanifestation of all SCP-7035-POND instances, any further research of these anomalies is currently __**IMPOSSIBLE**__.

**[B]**: Understand that SCP-7035-ELYSIUM is not well understood; the evidence obtained by the Foundation provides minimal information. Any form of studying the anomaly is currently __**IMPOSSIBLE**__.

SCP-7035-ELYSIUM refers to the city or state located in another dimension as described in Senior Researcher Jacob Graham&#39;s recovered files. SCP-7035-ELYSIUM is described as a &#34;perfect&#34; society in his files; it is described as having access to an unlimited food source,  an unlimited energy source, and the lack of any and all conflict. However, there are reasons to believe that SCP-7035-ELYSIUM may have the anomalous ability to manipulate the personalities of those who inhabit it.

**[C]**: SCP-7035-MOTHER is a female humanoid being with long black hair that wears a white wooden mask. No other accessories cover its body. Additionally, the entity&#39;s race or origin of birth is currently unknown due to its skin carrying multiple complexions, with each spot on its skin actively changing color.

SCP-7035-MOTHER&#39;s anomalous capabilities are not well understood, resulting in speculation about the anomaly. Researchers believe that the entity is a reality bender of a currently pending class, attributing the manifestation of SCP-7035-POND instances to it.

SCP-7035-MOTHER&#39;s origin is undetermined with further research into the matter currently being __**IMPOSSIBLE**__.

__March 16th, 2099__

We have heard your cries. Your cries of suffering. Your cries that have been muffled by the despair this world has brought upon you.

You must be so, so tired. Find us, come to us. Follow our voice and receive eternal love and rest. Follow the scent only paradise has to offer.

Do not be afraid.
 
We are not your enemies.

We are not your friends.

We are your... salvation.

Following the initial broadcast, a large influx of reports on various forms of media regarding the appearance of large bodies of water, SCP-7035-POND instances,  were disseminated in major cities. 17 men and 15 women have been recorded submersing themselves into these instances: none have been found to reemerge.

In order to prevent any further panic and casualties, the Foundation dispatched a total of 478 agents to secure every instance of SCP-7035-POND that could be identified. It took under 24 hours for all known instances to be secured.

On March 18th, 2099, approximately 5 hours after securing all instances, reports of a naked woman, now dubbed SCP-7035-MOTHER, exiting an instance located in Miami, Florida were submitted. 

The entity seemingly walked through all of the defenses set up surrounding the instance and entered one of the facility&#39;s interview rooms. It stated that it would like to talk to someone who was in charge. The following is a video log containing an interview between Head Researcher [REDACTED] and the entity.


[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Begin Video**

(//Researcher [REDACTED] enters the room. He sets his cup of coffee down on the table and takes a seat on the opposite side of the entity. He takes a moment before beginning the interview.//)

**[REDACTED]**: Um... do you want some clothes to put on before we...

(//SCP-7035-MOTHER angles its head on the right side while staring at the researcher. It pauses for a moment, seemingly confused, before addressing the issue.//)

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: Oh, please try not to mind. Clothes make us uncomfortable. 

**[REDACTED]**: Is there a reason for that?

(//The entity shakes its head while pointing to its mask.//)

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: This, as of now, is the only part that should be covered.

**[REDACTED]**: Oh, okay. Well... you came to us through one of those, um, wells so-.

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: Ponds...

**[REDACTED]**: Hmm?

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: Ponds, we call them ponds.

**[REDACTED]**: We? Are there more of your kind?

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: Hmm? Oh, yes there are more of us. Beyond the threshold.

**[REDACTED]**: The threshold?

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: The pond you saw us exit... the threshold it holds.

**[REDACTED]**: What&#39;s beyond this threshold?

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: Peace...

(//The entity pauses.//)

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: Love... safety and perfection.

(//The entity takes a moment to look down at the table while shifting its hand across.//)

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: Secluded and yet connected in every way. It is... beautiful, we must say. We founded it, trying to escape...

**[REDACTED]**: How does one pass this threshold?

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: By abandoning this realm, by taking a dive into the abyss to appreciate the light.

(//It pauses, admiring the interview room.//)

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: We don&#39;t think we&#39;ve introduced ourselves. We are Mother. The queens and messengers of Elysium.

**[REDACTED]**: I&#39;m guessing Elysium is the paradise you were talking about.

(//The entity nods.//)

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: We have noticed your attempts to restrict our ponds. We ask, why?

**[REDACTED]**: Over 30 people have drowned in your ponds. We can&#39;t even recover their bodies.

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: There are no bodies to recover.

//[REDACTED]&#39;s demeanor changes.//

**[REDACTED]**: What do you mean there are no bodies to recover?

(//The entity tilts its head once more.//)

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: Those who have crossed no longer wish to come back to your world. They decided to stay with us, which brings us to why we are here.

(//It stands up from its seat.//)

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: This is an invitation.

**[REDACTED]**: Hmm?

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: Since your association has reduced the amount we were expecting, we believe that some of you should enter our society.

(//[REDACTED] looks up at the entity, confused.//)

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: We don&#39;t ask for many, just enough to prove to you that we are harmless. We simply desire the betterment of humanity&#39;s souls.

**[REDACTED]**: Well then, right now, I can&#39;t just simply send people into your ponds. We don&#39;t know what&#39;s down there.

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: We see... There is no more of a reason for us to stay. We shall take our leave.

(//The entity walks to the exit of the interview room. Before it can pull the handle, the door is locked.//)

**[REDACTED]**: You don&#39;t get to just barge in here and leave so abruptly.

(//It turns to look at the researcher and tilts its head once more.//)

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: Only those deserving of suffering are locked in this realm.

**[REDACTED]**: Whoa! Hey, what the-.

(//The entity phases its body through the door while keeping its mask in the room.//)

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: The offer still stands.

**END**

[[/div]]



SCP-7035-MOTHER left the interview room and proceeded to the SCP-7035-POND instance. Guards stationed at the instance were ordered to apprehend the entity. Once the entity came into the view of the stationed guards they raised their weapons. The entity was ordered to stand down and return to the interview room but it did not comply.

The entity continued to walk to the instance, which prompted the allowance of non-lethal force by assigned guards to apprehend the entity. After this command, SCP-7035-MOTHER stood still and stared at the guards. It was recorded saying, &#34;sleep.&#34; Upon the vocalization of this word, all personnel in the facility surrounding the instance became unconscious. 

The entity proceeded to submerge itself in the instance and dive down further. No other communication with the entity has been made or attempted.

Following the emergence and disappearance of SCP-7035-MOTHER, a deliberation took place to decide whether or not Foundation personnel were allowed to be sent into an SCP-7035-POND instance under the term &#34;exploration&#34;. The deliberation took place between __March 17, 2099__ and __March 18, 2099__, and was decided by the O5-Council: the decision was to allow a maximum of three personnel to enter an instance before further experimentation would be allowed. The results stemming from this first set of exploration would determine future endeavors involving the anomaly.

The following video log is the first attempt at exploring an SCP-7035-POND instance, located in Miami, Florida. The personnel entering the instance is outfitted with a standard Foundation diving suit, along with an oxygen tank capable of allowing an hour of underwater exploration. The diver is D-109 and the exploration coordinator is Head Researcher [Redacted].

__March 18, 2099__

(//D-109 walks towards the instance while two guards stand behind him.//)

**[REDACTED]**: Now then D-107, this is a simple assignment. I want you to enter the pond that is before you.

(//D-109 looks up at the camera that [REDACTED] is looking through.//)

**[D-109]**: That&#39;s all ya&#39;ll want me to do. 

(//D-109 pauses and stares at the instance momentarily.//)

**[D-109]**: I always did have a fear of deep waters. Guess nows a good time as any to face them.

**[REDACTED]**: Proceed, D-109.

(//D-109 looks back at the camera one more time before carefully entering the instance.//)

**[REDACTED]**: Begin diving.

(//D-109 slowly dives down the instance, exiting both the view of the cameras and guards after approximately one minute. [REDACTED] turns on his microphone in order to communicate with D-109.//)

**[REDACTED]**: Do you hear me, D-109?

**[D-109]**: Uh, yeah. Yeah, I do. Jesus, it&#39;s cold down here.

**[REDACTED]**: What do you see down there? Anything we should know of?

**[D-109]**: Nah, not really. All I could tell you is that I&#39;d be blind without this flashlight.

**[REDACTED]**: I see, continue diving. We&#39;ll check in with you momentarily.

(//No contact has been made for approximately 7 minutes.//)

**[REDACTED]**: Are you still there D-109?

**[D-109]**: Yup...

**[REDACTED]**: Anything noteworthy?

**[D-109]**: No, nothing&#39;s changed. It&#39;s just dark and empty.

**[REDACTED]**: Continue on. If this continues, we&#39;ll bring you back up.

(//No contact has been made for approximately 15 minutes.//)

**[REDACTED]**: Hello, are you still there?

**[REDACTED]**: D-109?

**[REDACTED]**: D-109, do you hear me?

(//Static.//)

**[D-109]**: I can&#39;t look away. I feel so warm. I can&#39;t look away. I can only go forward. I feel so warm. I can&#39;t look away.

Contact with D-109 ceased abruptly. Attempts to reinstate contact had no results. An hour after contact with D-109 ended, a metal case emerged from the SCP-7035-POND instance. Inside was the Foundation diving suit D-109 utilized and a piece of paper with the following message written on it.



[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

I no longer wish to return.

Why would I?

There is nothing left for me there.

Here, I can breathe without worrying about the pollutants in the air.

Here, I can walk without being hated for the mistakes of my past.

Here, I can be happy.

I&#39;m staying with Mother.

Those who wish to leave that pitiful world, come and embrace the darkness, so you can appreciate the light.

This is my final link to the old world.

Goodbye...

Following the event concerning D-109, researchers within the facility began deliberating on how to gain any valuable evidence from the anomaly. A consensus amongst the researchers was that objects could be transported between both dimensions. 

Before another exploration was decided, an agent by the name of Jacob Graham volunteered to enter an instance. No other volunteers were found, which resulted in Agent Graham being the diver for this expedition.

Agent Graham was equipped with a Foundation diving suit, a standard Foundation sidearm, and a Foundation computer to record the exploration and entered the instance on __March 21, 2099__. Similar to D-109&#39;s case, contact with Agent Graham was lost approximately 25 minutes into the dive. Rs. Graham was instructed to return in 24 hours with his findings. 

24 hours had passed and he still did not return. 48 hours passed with Agent Graham still making no contact. At this point, it was believed that some unforeseen event occurred or there is no way back for organic matter. Further research was suspended as a result.

On __March 26, 2099__ a metal case containing Agent Graham&#39;s computer emerged from the SCP-7035-POND instance. The computer had a file labeled as __Access-Elysium__. The file held multiple transcripts describing his exploration of SCP-7035-ELYSIUM. Approximately 4 minutes after the recovery of Agent Graham&#39;s computer, all instances of SCP-7035-POND demanifested. No other instances have been reported since this event.

The following files are Agent Graham&#39;s files that describe his time in SCP-7035-Elysium and involve a mix of journal transcriptions and voice recorder transcriptions.

**[Agent Graham]**: Hello? Hello? Dammit! Looks like I&#39;m on my own now. Fuck me.  Okay... calm down, calm down. I&#39;m good.

Is the voice recorder on? Okay, good. Um, I guess I should say what happened when I got to the light. 

(//Panting could be heard.//)

When I got to the source of the light, it felt like my mind was starting to go blank. Everything around me began to be enveloped by the light until the only thing I was aware of was my own body and mind. Then it became dark again. I was now staring at a concrete floor, still submerged under the water. There was nothing else there. I&#39;m heading up now, it&#39;s still dark as could be down here, but I&#39;m heading up.

Right now I&#39;m just hoping there&#39;s a friendly face when I reach the top... or at least a top.

(//Silence ensues for the next 20 minutes.//)

You know, I&#39;m getting a little tired right now. My fingers and my right leg are starting to ache again, always wonderful timing. Still though, not even a shred of light yet. I&#39;m starting to get scared now. My oxygen&#39;s starting to run low. I got about 8 more minutes down here before I drown. Let&#39;s pray.

(//Silence ensues for 9 minutes.//)

Welp, guess this is how I die. What a dumb way to go.

(//Jacob begins breathing heavily.//)

Stop getting rid of all the air you dumb bastard. Come on, come on. I can make it, I can make it... Shit... I&#39;m not gonna make it.

(//Jacob holds his breath preparing for the worst. He holds his breath for 30 seconds before gasping for air.//)

Oh, I&#39;m not dying. I&#39;m alive. Oh shit! I&#39;m not drowning. Jesus Christ, I almost had a heart attack. Okay, wow, I&#39;m alive. Something&#39;s going on and I think it just saved me. I&#39;m out of oxygen but I&#39;m breathing just fine. Hmm. Let me try something.

(//A rustling noise could be heard. Jacob breathes quickly and then subsequently laughs.//)

Heh, the water isn&#39;t coming in. It looks like I can&#39;t drown in this pond. Woah, I see light, I&#39;m gonna make it.

**[Voice Recorder]**: Attention! The battery has reached critical levels, powering off!

Sorry about that, voice recorder ran out of juice. I was scared out of my mind once I heard it go off. Even though I was already alone that only emphasized it. I&#39;m good now though, guess you could say better than good. For the first time in a long time, I&#39;m sleeping in a bed that&#39;s at least half decent. I&#39;m getting ahead of myself though.

After the voice recorder went out, I was able to make it up to the top. It was dark out with a full moon showing. I took in my surroundings and began to climb out. First thing I noticed was how bright that moon was. Looked just like a regular moon but just prettier. 

Once I got out, I could see a city, or at least that&#39;s what I thought it was at the moment. Since there was nowhere else to go, I headed out that way. The weather out there was quite nice. So much better than the sticky heat of Florida. The wind was pleasant too, I could feel it brush upon me, like a comforting hand placed on my face.

It was probably after about 10 minutes of walking across that green plain that I met my first human of the day. He was an older gentleman sitting next to a campfire. He had a scruffy beard with brown eyes and a voice like that of a stereotypical Russian. 

He asked me, with a smile, &#34;where is ya heading?&#34; 

I said, &#34;to that city over yonder.&#34; He smiled and laughed and beckoned me closer with a wave of his hand. &#34;It should only take an hour or so,&#34; he said. &#34;But before that sit and eat, you look tired and famished friend.&#34;

I didn&#39;t know what else to do but take up o his offer. I sat down feeling my body relax from my recent workout.

&#34;What&#39;s your name?&#34;

&#34;Jacob Graham.&#34;

&#34;Funny name.&#34;

&#34;What&#39;s yours?&#34;

&#34;Don&#39;t matter.&#34;

&#34;Every name matters.&#34;

&#34;Not here.&#34;

We ate salted, grilled fish for a good 15 minutes after that little conversation. He seemed humble and clean even though he was living in a tiny lodge far away from the city. He got up and wiped his hands on his shirt and looked at me. He pointed in direction of the city.

&#34;Keep going forward,&#34; he said. &#34;You&#39;ll reach a gate embroidered with a white mask. Just yell your name and they&#39;ll let you in.&#34; He walked away, gesturing to some leftover fish. &#34;Help yourself, I&#39;m going inside.&#34;
He opened the door to his lodge and yawned.

&#34;Thank you.&#34;

&#34;Don&#39;t gotta.&#34;

I took some of the fish, leaving a good amount for him. Walking towards the gate, I could feel that same breeze again but this time it was warmer and lovelier. Don&#39;t know why. I&#39;ll probably test the air later, see what&#39;s up with that. 

It took about an hour to reach the gate. I yelled my name as loud as I could. There was no response. I yelled it again and then I heard the gears within the gates chatter. It opened faster than expected and I was greeted with a bright shine of light. Think I was blind for a second. I heard a voice stemming from the light and was greeted by a beautiful woman.

&#34;Welcome, ambassador,&#34; she said. She looked at me up and down as if I was lesser in value than what was proposed. &#34;We were expecting you, Jacob Graham.&#34; That creeped me out a tad.

&#34;How do you know my name,&#34; I said.

&#34;We have our ways.&#34; Her smile was intoxicating. It reminded me a lot of Monika.

She leads me past the gates toward a motel, which I&#39;m guessing is on the outskirts of the city. Walking inside I felt a rush coming from the air conditioning, one I haven&#39;t felt in years. The man behind the register looked at me with a smile and then turned to my guide. They only look at each other for a second before the man turns to me again.

&#34;Right this way sir,&#34; he said. Creepy... The room he led me to was standard and yet it felt like it was the fucking President&#39;s suite in a 6 out of a 5-star hotel. Spacious and yet sleek in its design, and don&#39;t get me started on the bed. Feels like momma&#39;s lap after a long day at elementary school. The woman tapped me on my shoulder to get my attention.

&#34;For now you may rest, we shall return and escort you into the city,&#34; she said.

&#34;How come you all are being so nice?&#34; I said. &#34;I pretty much just barged into your house.&#34; She smiled at me, with that same intoxicating smile.

&#34;The longer you stay, the more you shall understand.&#34; 

&#34;What&#39;s your name?&#34; Again, she smiled.

&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter.&#34; She walked leaving me in the confines of my room. Hearing the door slam into place was an odd feeling. Felt like it went in place perfectly. Creepy... After that, I just went ahead and washed my ass, I smelled like a dirty frog that just hopped out of a pond. Now I&#39;m laying here waiting till they come and get me, which leads us back here. 

I&#39;ll try inspecting this room, and see if I can find anything that&#39;s anomalous. So far though, nothing out of the ordinary. I&#39;ll write again or use my voice recorder when something interesting happens.

**[Agent Graham]**: Okay, I was going to write again but my fingers are aching again, so we&#39;re going with audio. I got a message through the room phone stating that the woman was on her way to escort me through the city. 

(//A rustling noise could be heard.))

Thankfully, there were suits inside the closet. Okay, I think I&#39;m good.

(//A knock can be heard.//)

Coming.

(//A creak is audible.//)

**[A Female Voice]**: Hello, ambassador Graham. Are you prepared?

**[Agent Graham]**: Yup, yup. All ready for whatever it is ya&#39;ll got to show me.

**[A Female Voice]**: Good, then follow us.

(//The mic is muffled.//)

**[Agent Graham]**: She said us, even though there&#39;s no one else here. Maybe it&#39;s a custom in this society.

(//Footsteps are heard and a door chime is audible.//)

**[Agent Graham]**: So, do you mind if I ask questions while we walk?

**[A Female Voice]**: No objections, ambassador Graham.

**[Agent Graham]**: Good, so first thing. Could you describe to me the system that this place works on?

(//A large mass of footsteps are audible through Jacob&#39;s mic.//)

**[Agent Graham]**: I mean, I doubt that this was all built on the foundation of capitalism. 

(//Jacob pauses.//)

**[Agent Graham]**: I&#39;ve also never seen such a vast array of people. So many colors, traditional attire, some I&#39;ve never seen before, and a vast array of smells... all of it mixed together so harmoniously. In my world, which is New York, a fight should&#39;ve happened by now.

**[A Female Voice]**: There is a universal connection present. There is no system we follow. Only what is for the betterment of society is passed.

(//Jacob sighs in confusion.//)

**[Agent Graham]**: I&#39;m sorry but that doesn&#39;t really answer my question. Is there, like a governing body I should be aware of or...

**[A Female Voice]**: Mother...

**[Agent Graham]**: Hmmm?

**[A Female Voice]**: Mother would be the only governing body we could think of.

**[Agent Graham]**: Really now? What does she handle?

**[A Female Voice]**: Everything...

**[Jacob]**: Interesting, I would love to meet this Mother character.

**[A Female Voice]**: You shall. 

(//The mic is muffled once more.//)

**[Agent Graham]**: Mother... sounds like the entity that came out of that SCP-7035-POND instance. I&#39;ll have to keep a lookout for it, may be dangerous.

**[A Female Voice]**: We have reached the desired location.

(//A door chime is audible with a rush of metallic and dripping noises//)

**[A Female Voice]**: We call this factory InfiFoodInc, one of many. 72 levels, with each focusing on various food sources. The first 36 levels focus on foods like fruits, vegetables, and grains. The next 36 focus on various cuts of meat: chicken, beef, turkey, ox, goat, snake, alligator, horse, bear, fish, pigeon, spiders, etc.

**[Agent Graham]**: Spiders?

**[A Female Voice]**: They are excellent sources of protein. The prime part of this factory, however, is the work environment. Extreme care is taken to prevent any form of defilement from happening upon the food.

**[Agent Graham]**: Now that you mention it, it&#39;s pretty sterile in here.

**[A Female Voice]**: Come. Along with the mass production of various exotic food resources, we have made great strides to increase quality and longevity. Here, an apple.

**[Agent Graham]**: You want me to eat this?

(//A swooshing sound could be heard.//)

**[Agent Graham]**: Ah, I&#39;ve always hated apples,

(//A crunching sound is audible.)

**[Agent Graham]**: Wow... this is great. This actually tastes good. What did ya‘ll put in this?

**[A Female Voice]**: Every source of nutrients in Elysium is constructed in factories like this. Every apple, every morsel of meat, and every drink is made here. 

**[Agent Graham]**: Hmm...

(//A crunching sound is audible.//)

**[Agent Graham]**: So how do you all make them? I mean it&#39;s not like you just press a few buttons on a machine.

**[A Female Voice]**: There did exist a time when a machine was capable of rearranging the atoms of an object or the gases in the air and transforming them into nutrients. However, it was inefficient and of a primitive design. The average time to create 5 ounces of beef was 10 hours. Attempts were made to improve the design, but they were all lackluster.

**[Agent Graham]**: So, how do you do it now?

**[A Female Voice]**: Extreme cell regeneration. The process was developed an eternity ago, utilizing a unique protein that forces the cells to replicate without any loss of energy: it can turn 5 ounces of meat into 90 in 1 minute. Conveniently, this protein also forces itself to replicate, seemingly going through a form of protein synthesis without DNA.

**[Agent Graham]**: Interesting, sounds anomalous in nature.

**[A Female Voice]**: Perhaps...

**[Agent Graham]**: If you don&#39;t mind, I would love to see the process in real time.

**[A Female Voice]**: We do not.

Nothing much to report today. The tour guide wasn&#39;t coming to get me so I just decided to take a walk through the city. Made sure my firearm was loaded and ready, just in case, and went on my way. The moment I walked out of that motel that same warm breeze hit my face. 

Started walking aimlessly, trying to find something that was interesting. I couldn&#39;t help but notice how clean everything was. The roads had no bumps and the sidewalks had no cracks. There wasn&#39;t a plastic bottle in sight and no spilled sugary drinks I could smell. The chirping of the birds was a nice touch. 

There were tall, fashionable towers everywhere I looked and even taller trees right alongside them. The greenery mixed with industrialization is beautiful, more beautiful than the smoke clouds in our world.

Walking through the crowds was unique. I swear to, um, whoever you are, they didn&#39;t even mutter a single word. They just kind of walked past me, seemingly avoiding me and my path at all times. It was like I was disrupting their coordinated rhythm. Creepy...

**[Agent Graha]**: This... sphere gives out unlimited energy?

**[A Female Voice]**: No, it&#39;s what&#39;s inside the sphere. It was created during the construction of Elysium and has remained not only a useful tool but also a tribute to the new and old days.

**[Agent Graham]**: How does it work?

**[A Female Voice]**: The only one who knows how it works in a technical sense would be Mother, seeing as how she was the one who created it.

Sorry for not updating as much as I should. I&#39;ve just been freaking out the past few days. The tour guide said she&#39;d come back the next day, but no luck in that department. I&#39;ve been hearing things as of late. Nothing outlandish but there so random.

They started out simple, just a knock at the door when no one was there or a tap on the window. Now though, I&#39;ve been hearing voices, intelligible whispers.  I hear them every night and every day. It&#39;s like I&#39;m being followed everywhere I go. 

Today it got so bad that I ended up running away from the city, thinking that if I got far enough the whispers would go away. I ran and ran with the whispers growing louder and louder. Soon enough, I reached a forest that was a good distance away. 

The whispers quieted down and I was so relieved and so tired that I think I collapsed under a tree. When I woke up, it was dark with the only sources of light around me being the moon and the stars behind it. Now that I think about it, I&#39;ve never seen that many stars in one place.

I got up trying to recollect myself and then heard a branch break behind. It was not with my foot, that I was certain. I haven&#39;t had a manic episode like that in years, and now something was stalking me out in the woods. But it wasn&#39;t a what but rather who?

I heard another branch be stepped on, which prompted me to get off my ass and start hauling it. As I was running I couldn&#39;t hear anyone chasing me, so I foolishly looked back. I don&#39;t know if I was hallucinating or still delirious but could&#39;ve sworn that I saw D-109. It was dark and everything was obscured by the waving branches of the trees but his face was so clear.

I&#39;ve been sitting in the motel, door locked and windows shut, since then. Dammit, our, no, my head hurts. I&#39;ve started picking up their pronouns for some reason. Christ, I don&#39;t know what to do.

All their eyes and all their senses focused on me. I am no longer addressed with the title ambassador and now I am only greeted with the blank, stone faces of their soulless and convictionless flesh.

**[A Female Voice]**: It was painful for you both, but you threw all the blame on her. You weren&#39;t eating right. You drank too much. Were you smoking without me knowing? You thought of every little thing to give a reason for that terrible event. You kept pushing and pushing, the entire ride home. Then... a flash of light came out of nowhere, you told her parents. It was merciful for her at least, it was quick and instant. But for you, it would be long and painful, knowing all those horrible things you said to her, with your damaged fingers and leg as reminders.

**[The Old Man]**: Because I&#39;m dumb and prideful, hated the idea of surrendering my own free will.

**[Agent Graham]**: But your wife is still in there.

**[The Old Man]**: Yeah, I know.

(//Silence...//)

**[The Old Man]**: She or at least her body still comes out to visit me. She just sits right next to the campfire, staring at it. I like to think that she&#39;s still in there somewhere. I&#39;m not leaving without my wife.

**[Agent Graham]**: I figured...

**[The Old Man]**: What are you going to do, Jacob? I already made my own decision.

**[Agent Graham]**: I don&#39;t know...

(//Silence endures...//)

**[The Old Man]**: Jacob&#39;s a funny name.

**[Agent Graham]**: It doesn&#39;t matter here.

**[The Old Man]**: Yeah...

(//The swishing and swooshing of water can be heard.//)

**[Agent Graham]**: Are you already in my head?

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: Partially, we are. We simply showed how it could be, how you could join us in paradise.

**[Agent Graham]**: I see...

(//Silence...//)

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: Your will is still yours and only yours. The choice to remain or disappear is all yours.

(//Silence...//)

**[Agent Graham]**: Will I still be somewhere in there?

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: You&#39;d simply be another part of the flock.

(//Silence...//)

**[Agent Graham]**: Does it hurt?

**[SCP-7035-MOTHER]**: There is no pain, no suffering, no heartbreak here.

**[Agent Graham]**: I see...

(//The swishing and swooshing of water can be heard//)

**[Agent Graham]**: That&#39;s nice...
