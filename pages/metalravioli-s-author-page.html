In the beginning, there was nothing. Sometime later, I was born. Sometime after that, I made an author page. Sometime after that, you began reading it.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Things people have said about me&#34;hide=&#34;- Things people have said about me but collapsed&#34;]]
&gt; [[*user MoreMuffins]] said &#34;I have no idea who you are. +1&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [[*user Ralliston]] said &#34;I remember the sonic-villain-whatever-his-name-was profile picture you. You cannot escape from me.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [[*user NebulousStar]] said &#34;Ravioli, ravioli, give me all your money-oli.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [[*user gee0765]] said &#34;Ravioli can&#39;t be metal that&#39;s literally impossible.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [[*user Aftokrator]] said &#34;According to all known laws of Italian cuisine, there is no way ravioli can be made with metal.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; [[*user CaliBold]] said &#34;Of course, ravioli is made of metal anyway, because Italians don&#39;t care what humans think.&#34;
[[/collapsible]]

Hello! Welcome to my author page. I guess I should tell you a little bit about myself! My name is MetalRavioli, my pronouns are She/Her, and I very much enjoy being here on the SCP wiki.

My main interests in life include fishkeeping, writing, and sleeping. I spend a lot of time attempting to write, however, a lot of it is pretty shit. My works on the site are just a few of many ideas I&#39;ve had and have sprawled out in my sandbox, but for the most part don&#39;t end up posting, since they&#39;re usually shit.

Some of my scips take place at this site I created called Site-225.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]I know there are probably like a bazillion Site-225&#39;s on the wiki, but I like the number![[/span]] Site-225 is a site in Nevada, that specializes in the containment of animals and creatures of all sorts.

While I haven&#39;t been on the wiki for long, I can tell that there are a lot of great people here. I&#39;m very excited to get to know a lot of you and make some friends along the way! I&#39;ve known about the Foundation for a while, but I only began writing scips around March of 2021, which has turned into a never-ending loophole.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]God please help me[[/span]] Anyways, you&#39;re probably just here to read my stuff, so I&#39;ll shut up.

[[include component:image-block name=Vulture|caption=Here&#39;s Shadow!]]
[[[SCP-6773]]] - &#34;Shadow the Shy Bird&#34;

[[module ListPages name=&#34;SCP-6773&#34;]]
**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**
[[/module]]

**Beginning Summary:** Gary, the owner of an animal sanctuary comes across this large injured bird, and takes it in. However, little does he know that taking in this bird will cause some wacky things to happen at his sanctuary!

**Authors Take:** This was the first SCP I ever wrote on the site, and it surprisingly survived! It took me ages to get it out, but around the beginning of July, I finally finished it and boldly posted it. As far as I know, it&#39;s a pretty decent scip!

[[module ListPages name=&#34;SCP-6366&#34;]]
**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**
[[/module]]

**Beginning Summary:** Axel, a shoebill, and Arsenio, a senegal bichir, are two sapient, thaumaturgically tied friends, who sometimes don&#39;t get along. Contained by the Foundation, the two are caught in the middle of a containment breach, and wacky hijinks ensue!

**Authors Take:** Probably my favorite piece I&#39;ve posted to the site. Took me a few weeks to write, and thanks to some very active critters I got it out fairly quickly! My first approach at comedy on the site turned out pretty well. [[*user Doctor Fullham]] also came up with the name for this one, so special thanks to them!

[[module ListPages name=&#34;SCP-6922&#34;]]
**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**
[[/module]]

**Beginning Summary:** Agents of the Foundation are cleaning up an oil spill when suddenly the oil starts demanifesting. Panicked, Dr. Anole begins searching for a possible anomaly and comes across an overly sarcastic crab, who causes a bit of confusion.

**Authors Take:** I wrote this one in a few days, and I&#39;m fairly proud of it. Again, this is mostly due to some very helpful critters, who always lead me in the right direction. This is also the first article on the wiki that features the CWPA.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]**Fun Fact:** I actually named the crab in this after my betta fish who passed a few days prior.[[/span]]

[[[SCP-6447]]] - &#34;Sinners&#39; Symphony&#34;

[[module ListPages name=&#34;SCP-6447&#34;]]
**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**
[[/module]]

**Beginning Summary:** The Foundation contains an amalgam made up of all the staff of Ex-Provisional Site-127, which is constantly singing. This entity exists to appease an Emergent Eschatological Entity (or EEE), being awakened, which could possibly threaten the entirety of humanity.

**Author&#39;s Take:** This was a mega-collab done with [[*user Jack Waltz]], [[*user Elunerazim]], [[*user MoreMuffins]], [[*user Aftokrator]], [[*user LORDXVNV]], [[*user Lt Flops]], [[*user GreenGolem]], [[*user JakdragonX]], and [[*user Cole 13]]! It was super chaotic and fun to write, which we did sentence by sentence. This SCP is fucking stupid and I hate it but it&#39;s still up and I am baffled by this. I still had a lot of fun writing this!

**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**
[[/module]]

**Beginning Summary:** The Foundation contains two sentient cows, both of which are very upset. However, Foundation therapist Dr. Anish soon learns that these two cows have some romantic tension.

**Author&#39;s Take:** First coldpost to the site![[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Besides the 2021 Art Exchange but shut the fuck up that doesn&#39;t count[[/span]] It is still up, so I consider this a success. I personally really like this one. At the time of making, it was the longest piece I&#39;ve ever made, at 9.9K words. I wrote this one for my betrothed [[*user georgiethefrog]], whose favorite animal is the Highland Cow!

[[[The Critters of Kiryu Labs]]]

[[module ListPages name=&#34;the-critters-of-kiryu-labs&#34;]]

**Beginning Summary:** Dr. Mark Kiryu and Researcher Riven Mercer have an argument over the number of pets in Kiryu Labs, and debate over whether or not Mark should get more. They are interrupted by Agent Tai Yang Shen, who informs them that a new anomaly has arrived, and wacky hijinks ensue!

**Authors Take:** I wrote this for [[*user Zyn]] in the 2021 Art Exchange, and it was a blast to write! I loved writing about the characters of Kiryu Labs, and I loved the character interactions I made happen in this tale!

What is the Ravioliverse?

The Ravioliverse is basically my own little loser canon that isn&#39;t big enough, doesn&#39;t have a strict plot/base, and doesn&#39;t have enough authors on it to be considered a canon. Many of my articles take place in it, and they can be defined as Ravioliverse articles by their presence in the list below.

The Ravioliverse is loosely set around Site-225, which takes containment to more ethical grounds. Site-225 is a mass containment site, containing anomalies of all shapes and sizes. Site-225&#39;s largest sector is its Fauna Containment Sector. White Site-225 contians all types of anomalies, it also conducts an abundant amount of research on fauna and flora, and specializes in the containment of live plants and animals.

For those of you who care (do not be ashamed if you do not) The complete Ravioliverse timeline in chronological order can be found below.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Name:** Azariah Ravioli

**Position:** Senior Researcher, Doctor, Zoologist, Cryptobiologist

**Pronouns:** She/Her

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**DOB:** 03/27/1922

**Location:** Site-225

**History:** Born in Nevada in 1922, young Azariah Ravioli was born to Jessica Ravioli, and Benjamin Ravioli, both of who had jobs at the Foundation. Azariah had a rather happy childhood, she made friends among her peers, and got good grades. At the age of 18, Azariah graduated from high school and planned to become a surgeon. However, her plans were changed when her parents introduced her to the Foundation.

Azariah instead went on to earn her Masters&#39;s Degree in zoology and cryptobiology. In 1948, At the age of 26, Azariah joined the Foundation and was stationed at Site-225. However, soon after Azariah&#39;s integration at Site-225, the site experienced a massive containment breach, resulting in the deaths of her mother and father.

In 1949, Azariah was subject to an anomalous gas that mysteriously manifested in Site-225 during testing. This gas caused Azariah to gain animal-like characteristics, such as developing the gills and tail of an axolotl, as well as the ability to breathe underwater. Testing revealed that Azariah had become anomalously resilient to higher levels of pressure. Azariah&#39;s aging process was also anomalously affected, showing that she aged up to 15 times slower. While this was initially shocking to Azariah, she quickly accepted her new characteristics.
