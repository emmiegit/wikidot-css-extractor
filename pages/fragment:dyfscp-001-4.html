    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>+ 4/8048 Clearance Accepted. Welcome, Dr. Naismith.

**Item:** SCP-8048

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-8048 is kept in Warehouse 9 of the Large Anomaly Containment Wing at Site-59. Due to the ongoing investigation, a means to open the bulkhead and examine SCP-8048&#39;s contents must be discovered as soon as possible.

**Description:** SCP-8048 is a 13.59 m x 2.44 m x 2.9 m shipping container. Its exterior has been reinforced with an unknown substance that, to date, has completely withstood all attempts to cut through.

The interior can only be accessed through a fortified bulkhead at one end. Though the words &#34;SCP-001&#34; have been written on the side in black paint, there is no evidence of any connection between SCP-8048 and SCP-001.

**Recovery:** SCP-8048 was discovered under a mound of earth and snow near the northern border of Lapland, Finland. Local Sami legends have attested to its existence since ancient times, claiming that it was the home of an old and powerful sorcerer. Shortly after excavation, the soil directly above SCP-8048 has been dated to at least 9,000 BCE.

Prior to recovery, a narrow, winding tunnel through the mound led from the door to the outside. The tunnel bore significant wear from having been used as a footpath. Other than that, there has been no conclusive evidence that anyone has entered or exited the door before recovery.

**Addendum - PoI-8048:** During the initial excavation on April 12th, 1993, SCP-8048&#39;s bulkhead opened. PoI-8048 exited the object and snapped his fingers, which closed the door behind him. (Attempts by Foundation personnel to open the door with finger-snapping have been unsuccessful.)

PoI-8048 is a 32-year-old man of French Canadian descent who answers to the name Dr. Laurence Michaud. He has made multiple outlandish claims about himself and SCP-8048, including but not limited to:

* SCP-8048 is a time machine.
* He held the office of O5-11 in the year 3030 from an alternate timeline.
* Said timeline experienced a &#34;modified&#34; ΩK-Class End-of-Death scenario that coincided with the invasion of a Tiamat-class anomaly known as SCP-UBU.
* SCP-UBU was an extremely dangerous and sadistic entity who was capable of, among other things, neutralizing SCP-169 and SCP-682.
* His timeline&#39;s version of the Foundation launched &#34;Project Beluga,&#34; which resulted in an impossible war with SCP-UBU that lasted 441 years.
* PoI-8048 deliberately sabotaged SCP-319 to act as a power source for SCP-8048, thus arriving in Lapland in the year 11,970 BCE.
* SCP-UBU will arrive in Greenland on May 12th, 2588.
* PoI-8048 was able to extend his lifespan by sharing his consciousness between a central computer within SCP-8048 and several thousand bodies created by his personal hominid replicators. Said consciousness-sharing was achieved through a book classified in the future as &#34;SCP-YEZ.&#34;
* He wishes to assist the Foundation in the termination of SCP-UBU, and has laid out a plan for its termination as outlined in Document-8048-Zeta.

Despite legitimacy concerns, PoI-8048 was able to mention at least 104 specific terms and pieces of data known only to standing members of the O5 Council.

&gt; **Interview 8048-58124**
&gt; **Location:** Site-59
&gt; **Date:** 4/14/95
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Isaiah Henderson
&gt; **interviewed:** PoI-8048
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;Begin Log&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Henderson:** Please state your name for the record.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-8048:** Dr. Laurence Michaud, former O5-11. &#34;█████ ██ ██████ ████, ████, ██████ ██ ████ ██.&#34;[[footnote]] A memetic passphrase that, when spoken by anyone other than a current or former O5-11, will result in the subject bursting into flames. [[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Henderson:** We&#39;re not here to discuss your legitimacy. That&#39;s no longer in question.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-8048:** Better late than never. Suppose you&#39;d better get to the point, then.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Henderson:** If we could proceed without unnecessary hostility -
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-8048:** Isaiah, I have seen what is coming, I have lived through it, //I have provided a definitive solution,// and all I&#39;m met with at every turn are caveats and hand-wringing. I&#39;m allowed to not be thrilled.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Henderson:** If you&#39;re referring to Document-8048-Zeta, it was rejected because it would pose an unacceptable risk to the civilian public.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-8048:** I wasn&#39;t aware that we were only allowed to make uncomplicated and guilt-free decisions in our profession.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Henderson:** The point is, the O5 Council thanks you for what you have provided us in the way of intelligence regarding a future anomaly -- but they have moved to terminate you and handle SCP-UBU themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Ten seconds of silence. PoI-8048 sighs deeply.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-8048:** ...on what grounds?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Henderson:** There is evidence that you have been filling the Foundation with double agents.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-8048:** My years as an O5 have taught me that the Foundation can&#39;t be trustworthy without special help.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Dr. Henderson points a gun at PoI-8048 under the table.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-8048:** But I didn&#39;t know your collective unreliability ran this deep. I mean, given the situation, I&#39;d probably be significantly more frightened if this -
&gt; 
&gt; //(Dr. Henderson fatally shoots PoI-8048. He motions to one of the guards at the door.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Henderson:** Go and tell the O5 council it&#39;s done.
&gt; 
&gt; **Guard:** //(Speaking with the same voice as PoI-8048.)// ...if this were my only body. But honestly? I&#39;m just disappointed. Here I thought I&#39;d have allies in the fight against the greatest evil ever visited upon -
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Henderson:** //(To the other guard)// Shoot him!
&gt; 
&gt; //(The other guard complies.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(Dr. Henderson calls up O5-4.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-4:** Has the termination been carried out?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Henderson:** Yes, but there&#39;s a problem. See, he -
&gt; 
&gt; **O5-4:** //(Suddenly speaking in PoI-8048&#39;s voice)// - ever visited upon this planet. But I&#39;m alone, Isaiah. Once again, I&#39;m the only person who isn&#39;t willing to give it all up and fall back in the Zonk Pile.
&gt; 
&gt; So you know what? I started it alone, and I&#39;ll end it alone. Project Beluga will continue with or without the -
&gt; 
&gt; //(Dr. Henderson hangs up.)//
&gt;
