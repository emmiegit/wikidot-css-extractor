**Item #:** SCP-2761

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2761 is currently stored in a lead-lined Class-B Semi-Aquatic containment unit in Site-71. Clearance for SCP-2761 research is available to Level 2 personnel and higher; research of SCP-2761 genetics is limited to Level 3 personnel and above. Though carnivorous, SCP-2761 must be supplied a steady diet of fruit to minimize the carcinogen output in its waste[[footnote]] Fruit belonging to the genus //Musa// (i.e. bananas and plantains) have been most successful. [[/footnote]]. As such, Site-71 personnel assigned to SCP-2761 must set aside time to restock food supplies every week.

**Description:** SCP-2761 is a genetic hybrid species that has undergone multiple physical mutations since its containment in 2005. It initially possessed amphibious and piscine traits similar to those of species found within the Florida Everglades //(Where it was originally discovered)//, but has since developed more reptilian features. As of May 13, 2016, SCP-2761 measures twelve meters in length and resembles a large, hunchbacked bipedal alligator with a mouth structure similar to that of //Carcharhinus leucas// (Bull shark). SCP-2761 possesses a notably yellow skin coloration, a petaled, flexible &#34;frill&#34; that can conceal and protect its face, and constantly exudes a scent described as smelling like &#34;overripe bananas.&#34;

Additionally, SCP-2761 possesses bio-hazardous blood. At least 32 known genetic carcinogens and dozens of known hazardous bacteria strains including //Clostridium tetani//, //E.coli//, and //Streptococcus// are present; it appears its gut flora also constantly produces even more of the former. However, instead of causing SCP-2761 harm, it appears these compounds and bacteria are beneficial for it, inciting even further mutations over time; strangely, despite all the mutations SCP-2761 has undergone, it has never shown signs of any cancers or tumors.

SCP-2761 cells each possess an extremely large nucleus, with the genomes containing hundreds of spliced genes from other various species. Apart from its primary genome, the nuclei also contain at least 68 other unaltered sets of DNA from various species; these unaltered genomes have never shown signs of major mutation, despite SCP-2761&#39;s blood being full of mutagens. Instead of breaking down and causing major long-term health problems, SCP-2761&#39;s genome will rapidly rearrange and replace lost segments with DNA from the unaltered genomes, inciting SCP-2761&#39;s gradual changes in physical appearance. It is possible that SCP-2761 can somehow absorb and express these genomes through the organisms it eats.[[footnote]] DNA sets include //Alligator mississippiensis// (American alligator), //Atractosteus spatula// (Alligator gar), //Grus americana// (Whooping Crane), and incomplete fragments of //Homo sapiens// and //Canis lupus familiaris//[[/footnote]]

**Addendum 2761-1:** Investigation into SCP-2761 uncovered information pertaining to a company known as &#34;Aquagene&#34;, a pet storefront that sells heavily genetically modified aquarium fish. Their selection is primarily made up of fish that exhibit color patterns not seen in their natural species, such as bioluminescence and exotic color themes[[footnote]] Examples of brand names include &#34;Neon Splatterblast^^TM^^&#34;, &#34;Galactic Sparkle^^TM^^&#34;, and &#34;Hot Stuff Lava Lamp^^TM^^&#34; [[/footnote]]. SCP-2761 was apparently part of a set of prototypes for their next installment &#34;Scenty Fruit Fish^^TM^^.&#34; Below is an interview of Dr. Pearl Watkins (29), and Dr. Marcus Nakamura (41), two employees and genetic scientists at Aquagene.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Interview SCP-2761-1, March 14, 2005.&#34; hide=&#34;-Collapse&#34;]]

&gt; **Interviewed:** Dr. Pearl Watkins and Dr. Marcus Nakamura
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Matthew Liu
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** The purpose of this interview was to obtain information on SCP-2761, and possible motive behind its creation. Dr. Watkins and Dr. Nakamura were brought to an office near Site-71 for questioning, under the guise of an EPA questioning. 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log, 1320&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Liu:** Dr. Watkins, Mr. Nakamura.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** //(Sighs.)// Hello, sir. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nakamura:** Sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Liu:** My name is Matthew Liu; I&#39;m an agent with the EPA. I assume you know why you&#39;re both here?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** //(Looks down at floor.)// Yes, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nakamura:** //(Looks to the left corner of the room.)// Yes, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Liu:** We&#39;ve been looking into your sales records for a while now. There&#39;s been some... questionable products you have on the market. Would you like to fill me in on your thoughts about this?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** They aren&#39;t a hazard.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Liu:** Excuse me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nakamura:** //(Under breath.)// Pearl.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:**  We were careful to make sure all fish were sterile before putting them out in the market. We know the risks of crossbreeding with the wildlife. If you&#39;re thinking that any of our fish could reproduce with the wildlife then--
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Liu:** Dr. Watkins, we&#39;re not interested in Aquagene&#39;s overall business operations, we&#39;re only interested in one particular specimen. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** //(Surprised.)// I&#39;m sorry, what?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nakamura:** So, you -- we&#39;re not in any legal trouble for selling our fish?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Liu:** At the moment, no, though that may change depending on if you can help us or not.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** Um, all right... What... What particular product are you talking about, exactly, then?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Liu:** In August of last year, it appears you were starting up a new line of modified fish that would be released during the holidays.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nakamura:** //(Looks up, and appears excited.)// Oh, the Scenty Fish! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:**  //(Rolls eyes, annoyed.)// Marcus...
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Liu:** Would you care to explain more about these?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nakamura:** Of course, sir! See, our idea was to make a tropical-themed fish set, sort of Hawaii in December, if you will. And, we wanted to introduce these fish as a sort of living air freshener...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** Marcus...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nakamura:** We were going to go for the classic samples. Our plan was for the selection to include apple goldfish, strawberry tetras, orange clownfish, raspberry and blueberry bettas...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** //Marcus//...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nakamura:** ... pineapple puffers, and banana pipefish!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** //(Slaps forehead with right hand. Angrily.)// Oh my //god//, Marcus, will you //please// shut up about your Scenty Fish? I know, I know, they were your project proposal, and we agreed to go through with them, but //Jesus//, can you //please// not advertise to this man about --
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Liu:** Did you say &#34;banana pipefish&#34;?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** Yes, he did. I&#39;m sorry, Mr. Liu, I can explain. What is it about this fish you wanted to know?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Liu:** It is possible that one of these specimens escaped from your company&#39;s aquarium some time in September of last year.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** ...I&#39;m sorry?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Liu:** On March 3, a research group of ours managed to catch... //(Researcher Liu produces a picture of SCP-2761 in its initially discovered form, which resembles a yellow, 2 meter alligator gar with early signs of leg development.)//... this organism. Can you identify it? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** What the hell is--
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nakamura:** Holy shit.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Liu:** Is it possible that this fish could have originally been one you engineered?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** //(Stammers.)// I-- I--
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Liu:** It appears that its genome is very unstable, and is somehow able to express the genes of other animals it eats. Is it possible that something could have gone wrong with the gene splicing in its early stages?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nakamura:** I mean -- It... It looks like it could possibly be... I mean... it&#39;s definitely yellow, so-- But that looks nothing like a pipefish, and ours were only about twenty centimeters long --
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** Oh, //shit.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Liu:** Dr. Watkins?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nakamura:** Pearl? What&#39;s wrong?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** Son of a //bitch.// I should&#39;ve known he&#39;d do something like that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Liu:** Dr. Watkins, please, explain what is going on.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** Higgins. I caught Higgins pulling some shit during the first few weeks of initial gene splicing. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nakamura:** ... Pearl. I //thought// you had Higgins fired after the stunt he pulled with the Peanut Jellyfish. You let him work on my team?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** He&#39;s one of our lead geneticists, Marcus, it&#39;s not like I could just get rid of him. Do you understand how difficult it is to splice more than a third of the genes from a //goddamn fruit// to a fish and still make it act like a //fish?// 
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Liu:** Dr. Watkins, Dr. Nakamura, if you please.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nakamura:** I apologize, Mr. Liu. You see, our, um, Scenty Fish project. It encountered quite a few bumps in the R&amp;D. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** That is a //gross// understatement. There are fifty chromosomes in a pineapple to work with and the puffer species we were working with only had --
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nakamura:** //So//, it seems that, without my knowledge, Pearl decided to temporarily hire Dr. Gregory Higgins to my research team. He has... since been terminated from Aquagene for unprofessionalism.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** You see, Mr. Liu, Greg was a bit of a wild card in our department. He was smart, brilliant, even. But, he... He&#39;d like to do his own little side projects, even sometimes made unauthorized modifications to our fish because he thought he could improve their marketability. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Liu:** I see. Were there any incidents leading up to our capture of this specimen?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** //(Sighs and rubs temples.)// Unfortunately, yes. In about the fifth week of development, I caught Higgins tampering with a batch of the baby banana pipefish. He was... making them more carnivorous, more yellow. He said he thought it would be [EXPLETIVE] hilarious if we could sneak a biting banana into the local grocery stores. Obviously, it was a gross breach of conduct, and not even within our main market of interest. So I confiscated them. However, Rayleigh wouldn&#39;t be in for proper disposal till next morning, so I left them locked in my office with a note on the door.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Liu:** If you were able to retrieve them, then how did --
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** When I came into work the next day, the fish were gone. I asked Rayleigh if he had gotten rid of them, and he said he hadn&#39;t even gone around to pick up stuff yet. So I went to Higgins. He said he&#39;d disposed of them himself, even walked me to the takeaway unit to prove those things were there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nakamura:** Pearl, are you saying that he made --
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** Mr. Liu, is there anything else unusual you found in this fish&#39;s biology, apart from the fact that its genome was highly susceptible to change? Particularly, diet?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Liu:** Yes, actually. We&#39;ve taken waste samples from this organism. It appears that it contains a multitude of gut flora usually found in people, along with various carcinogens.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nakamura:** //(Silent.)// Oh my //god.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** ... You&#39;ve got to be shitting me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Nakamura:** So... Higgins must have made more of those things after he took them back, put the originals in the disposal unit and then--
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Watkins:** And then flushed the rest of them down the goddamn [[[Bananazilla Begins, Part I|toilet.]]]
