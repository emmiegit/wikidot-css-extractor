&gt; The **MA-Class Mass Animation Scenario** is the Foundation&#39;s term for any scenario wherein a large number of nonliving things display intelligence or mobility to the point of jeopardizing normalcy. This may or may not also entail an &#34;SK-Class Dominance Shift&#34;, depending on the power and resources available to newly animated things.
&gt; 
&gt; An MA-Class Mass Animation Scenario should not be declared until at least one of the following is affirmed:
&gt; * Return of the situation to normalcy, i.e. deactivating the newly animated entities and erasing memories of the event, is infeasible.
&gt; * Location and destruction of the affected things is considered impractical or unethical.
