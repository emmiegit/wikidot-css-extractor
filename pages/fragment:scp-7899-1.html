//Johnston enters the airlocks into the chemical shower. The spray batters the camera, obscuring the lens. She turns 360 degrees as the shower goes on for thirty seconds. Johnston wipes off the camera, picks up a Haz-Mat suit, and takes a minute to put it on. She enters the containment cell proper to find the cold storage where SCP-7899-B is being kept. She opens the freezer and finds the vials in question, placing them in a secure containment case. She presumably puts them into her pack when an explosive sound is heard. The sound of footsteps is heard thereafter.//

The closing of two lockers is heard as Johnston presumably fits herself into one of them. Her stifled heavy breathing is heard and everything goes still for a few minutes.//

//The sound of Russian speaking is heard as the voices get louder and louder. Footsteps are audible in the footage followed by the sound of gurgling and pained grunts succeeded by two metallic thuds. Thirty seconds pass before the locker creaks open and Johnston re-engages her flashlight.//

//The camera is moved onto the desk. Two mercenaries come out from the dark, shining the flashlights of their rifles around. They exchange a few words, appearing to examine the various happenings in the office.//

//As one of the mercenaries starts to turn the corner around the desk, their neck is held back and something thin bursts from their chest. The mercenary starts to gurgle as his partner begins to shoot in the direction of their assailant. The bullets bounce off of a shimmering figure as the mercenary being held is summarily disemboweled. The dead mercenary is dropped as their guts hit the floor. The other mercenary continues shouting and shooting at the shimmer. The mercenaries&#39; knee is struck causing them to fall onto their opposite. Their head shows signs of being grabbed as they scream for their life.  The crunch of bone and the squishing of flesh is heard as the right side of their head violently bursts.//

Valravn has no love for the Robotic Republic. What they are doing is an affront to the life that is given to us by the gods. The Republic hired the Volks. The Operations department got word and decided that one of their fancy TVs could do wonders for our AI program. So, VHQ sent me.
