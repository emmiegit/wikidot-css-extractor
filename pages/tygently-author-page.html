]]

**Name:** Dr. Ty███ S. Gently

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Position:** Researcher, Department of Memetics and Cognitohazards

**Current Location:** Mail Room, Site-77

**History:** Dr. Gently was recruited by the Foundation following the ██████ University incident, of which they were the only survivor (Gently cites &#34;not looking at the dreadlords, seriously, did anyone else see raiders of the lost ark?&#34; as the primary reason for their survival). Deemed a possible asset to the Foundation, Gently received an education in memetics and cognitohazards. They are, by definition, unable to comprehend or process this education in any way except through recurring nightmares.

[[tab SCP Articles]]
**[[[SCP-2330]]]:** A Convincing Whiteboard
&gt; When everyone believes a lie, that lie becomes normal, and we must protect that perception until we find a way to guide it back towards the truth.

**[[[SCP-2660]]]:** An object that removes darkness
&gt; All information created involving SCP-2660 is persistent; it cannot be expunged, redacted, or lied about in any way.

**[[[SCP-2548]]]:** The Friendly Vacuum
&gt; **SCP-2548:** I contain myself. You contain me? I saw stars, Milky Way galaxy. All in you? Space outside? Am I space?

**[[[SCP-2985]]]:** Anart, Author of the Scream
&gt; The painting is done. Does not feel like I thought it would. I don&#39;t feel equal; no great reverence burst from me as I became the old masters. Instead I&#39;m… proud?

**[[[SCP-644]]]:** Mr. Hot
&gt; **SCP-644:** And I&#39;d say that to him, and he&#39;d say to me &#34;Hot, you have quite the melon on your shoulders&#34; and I&#39;d say &#34;Wow, thanks, boss&#34; and then he&#39;d put a miniature melon on my shoulder and we&#39;d both laugh. It&#39;s our little joke, see?

**[[[SCP-2524]]]:** No Strings
&gt; When a living human being&#39;s shadow is cast by SCP-2524&#39;s flame, the shadow appears as if the human subject casting the shadow were instead a life-sized marionette puppet resembling the subject in size and build.

**[[[SCP-2970]]]:** Holy Misplacement
&gt; SCP-2970 is a cybernetically enhanced human male of African descent. SCP-2970 claims to have been born in the 10th century CE.

**[[[SCP-2855]]]:** Mr. Money
&gt; **SCP-2855:** Not to say there&#39;s anything wrong with that—with lies, I mean—but a child deserves truth, right? So the doctor makes his moves, and with me… you get what you pay for.

**[[[SCP-2624]]]:** Laika&#39;s Sweetheart Space-Beacon
&gt; SCP-2624 is capable of ejecting singular dogs at velocities exceeding 10 km/s as propulsion to alter its orbit and counteract orbital decay.

**[[[SCP-3900]]]:** The Internet of Things That Are Wolves
&gt; Wolves created through SCP-3900 do not exhibit wireless connectivity and are otherwise non-anomalous.

**[[[SCP-3475]]]:** Our Shifting Foundations
&gt; If each of these initiatives can be thought of as exerting a force on civilian humanity, SCP-3475 is the sum of these forces: a single vector denoting the direction in which human thought is being changed. 

**[[[SCP-4844]]]:** Last Man Standing
&gt; A scale model of the United States of America. Florida is absent. Much of the midwest is covered by an engraving of Tim &#34;The Toolman&#34; Taylor. He is smiling and wielding a claw hammer.

**[[[SCP-5077]]]:** Bait and Switch
&gt; Most D-Class personnel not previously evacuated were rescued and amnesticized. Those who were hostile or otherwise unrecoverable were terminated.

**[[[Loss and Nostalgia]]]**
&gt; She was only partially whole, of course, having long shed the modifications that marred her face during her time in &#39;captivity&#39;. Her left eye was glass but it may as well have been a window.

**[[[Samsara]]]**

**[[[orgy 5 counsel 9|Orgy 5 Counsel 9: XXXK End of Virginity Scenario]]]**
&gt; The Sexual Conservatism Protectorate was wildly successful for the next two decades, fighting foul Groups of Intercourse like Herman Fuller&#39;s Circus of Debauchery, Hermaphroditus Labs, GRU Division &#34;Penis&#34;, and Are We Chaste Yet?.

**[[[What Ever Happened?]]]**
&gt; They could not evade the mindkill forever. They would die eventually, and a new person would be born from their corpse.

**[[[Under Control]]]**
&gt; He was travelling, but he was staying in the same place. He skimmed the surface of another world, his hands creating ripples in the water- no, the fabric of the boundary. Adam was in two places at once.
 
**[[[A History of Reaction]]]**
&gt; The woman told the task force something that they were later unable or unwilling to recall. When she finished, the task force began to vomit live, non-venomous snakes.

**[[[What&#39;s The Deal?]]]**
&gt; &#34;Mr. Seinfeld, even with your magic powers, there&#39;s no way you could beat Tim Allen in a fight.&#34;

**[[[Clash of the Cosmic Comedians]]]**
&gt; &#34;Prepare to die, Seinfeld.&#34; Tim Allen closed his eyes as countless rocket pods sprouted from his back like wings. &#34;To infinity…&#34; he yelled, &#34;and //BEYOND//!&#34;

**[[[Death Perception]]]**
&gt; “In my books, the medium rubs the ball and coaxes the ghost out. If we gently cradle the orb, the ghost might appear. Like a ghost egg.”

**[[[The Powers That Bark]]]**
&gt; Onru squinted into the dog’s mouth. Its panting breath was hot on her face. “Are all dogs cyborgs?”

**[[[wowwee un kill ursefl]]]**
&gt; &#34;You hear that, buddy? You&#39;re the drill bit with which we will tear this country a new asshole.&#34;

**[[[The Second Cool War Begins]]]**
&gt; Two days. Fog city. Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re too cool to be there. The revolution will not be televised, but it will be live-shouted from this account.

**[[[Workshop of the Telescopes]]]**
&gt; Son of a bitch. I would&#39;ve bet money that we&#39;d already done aliens.

&gt; He glanced over his shoulder, back at Casey. &#34;So, uh, for the record, if you are an actual murderer, it would be super uncool of you not to tell me now.&#34;

**2: [[[Automatic Stop]]]**
&gt; Once Vera Garcia had reported to Taco Bell and found a false bottom in her bag of one Burrito Supreme and one Crispy Chicken Quesadilla, she knew that her plan had been approved by the Rotisserie Outfitters Bureau.

**3: [[[The End Has No End]]]**
&gt; &#34;I&#39;m sorry, do you have friends that you have not yet murdered, amnesticized, or dragged into this death spiral with you? If so, they should //also// be leaving the city.&#34;

&gt; The light returned to Three Portlands the way it returns to a movie theatre once the credits stop rolling: sheepishly, as if embarrassed by the popcorn-strewn wasteland it had become over the course of the film.
