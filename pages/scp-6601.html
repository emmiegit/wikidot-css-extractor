**Item #:** SCP-6601

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6601 is to be hosted onto a D-class (D-5186 is the current host). The current host is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit. Direct contact from the current host to any person is not allowed. Performing relevant experiments requires the permission of at least one Level 3 personnel.

**Description:** SCP-6601 is a sapient incorporeal entity. The subject is able to coexist with humans, but it is unknown whether this is necessary for it to survive. SCP-6601 has a mild temper, but can be insistent in terms of changing the host&#39;s memories.

Please refer to the discovery and addendums for details.

**Discovery:**

**Reported by:** //Dr. Li//

**Position of reporter:**
☑ Researcher  
☐ Agent
☐ Department/Site Director
☐ Logistics Personnel

**Urgency:** --Low-- High
------
**Details:**

I am always proud of my eidetic memory, but one day, I found out that they are **false**.

Combined with my work experience in the Foundation, I can&#39;t help but worry that this is an abnormal effect. Besides, I also went to the hospital for an examination, and I was able to confirm that there was no problem with my memory.

I remember clearly that I spent a very happy childhood with my parents in my hometown; but just when I was about to call my parents to greet them, I found out that my father had died before I was born. And my family apparently couldn&#39;t support the expenditure that I remember.

There are many things more serious and distinctive than these. In a word, the discrepancy between memory and reality makes me quite sure that my memory has been tampered //intentionally//. I feel uneasy at the thought of the possibilities behind it.

So I apply for and am willing to accept all the inspections of the Foundation.

I hope these are just because of my mental problems, because this is the most reassuring result.

Upon further examination, SCP-6601 was discovered using Dr. Li as a host.

Dr. Li further reported that after the object was discovered, it was communicating with him by changing memories[[footnote]]For example: fabricating a note in a certain scene in memory, or inserting a voice of unknown source directly, etc.[[/footnote]], and showed fear of being found. After Dr. Li tried to communicate with it in the way of reminiscence, SCP-6601 expressed its willingness to be interviewed by the Foundation.
------
**Addendum.6601-A - Interview results:**

//**Foreword:**// SCP-6601 changed Dr. Li&#39;s memories throughout the process, leaving answers to the interviewer in Dr. Li&#39;s memories. Dr. Li spoke on its behalf.
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. George
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewee:** Dr. Li (And SCP-6601)
&gt; 
&gt; **Information:**
&gt; * SCP-6601 claimed that it has no malice.
&gt; * SCP-6601 can be transferred through the host&#39;s physical contact with other human beings.
&gt; * SCP-6601 claimed that the only effect it has on the host is to change the memories.
&gt; * SCP-6601 claimed to be able to host onto all mammals, but favors humans.
&gt; * SCP-6601 claimed to change Dr. Li&#39;s memories to &#34;give him a happy childhood&#34;.
&gt; //[In the interview, Dr. George expressed doubts about the above statements.]//
&gt; * It is unknown whether SCP-6601 has any relatives(SCP-6601 began not to respond).
&gt; * It is unknown how many humans SCP-6601 has hosted before.
&gt;
&gt; **Afterword:** After further communication failed, SCP-6601 was forced to transfer from Dr. Li to D-5186 under the threat of executing Dr. Li.

**Note:** Some incorporeal entities that can change humans&#39;s memories are wandering around the world. What does it mean?

A person&#39;s spirit is entirely constructed from memories. As long as it is willing, it can subvert many things.

I propose to change the object to refer to its entire ethnic group, and reclassify it as Keter, and then take prompt action. After all, how can I make sure that it is not disguising? How can I make sure that it has no malicious relatives?

**Addendum.6601.B - Researcher&#39;s notes**
&gt; It left such a piece of paper on a desk in my memory before it left me. Every word on it is very clear imprinted in my mind.
&gt; 
&gt; I have transcribed the original text here for reference. Please keep it.
&gt; [[&gt;]]
&gt; - Dr. Li
&gt; ##white|Thank you very much.##
&gt; [[/&gt;]]
&gt; ------
&gt; //I&#39;m sorry for the trouble I&#39;ve caused.//
&gt; 
&gt; //I&#39;ll start by answering the questions I wasn&#39;t able to answer because I was too scared: I don&#39;t know if I have relatives, I&#39;ve never met any. As for this body, it is my 25843^^rd^^ home.//
&gt; 
&gt; //In fact, I can stay in my first home with peace of mind until her death, and then look for opportunities to move safely to the next place. But as you already know, I live in human memory; and I am affected by those memories.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Her childhood was miserable. She has never enjoyed the love of her family, and there is also unreasonable(at least I think so) discrimination and ridicule. Fear, uneasiness, melancholy, inferiority, all of these, shrouded in her whole childhood.//
&gt; 
&gt; //These directly affected her present moment. No one saw how she felt on the inside. No one. I can&#39;t figure out why other people treat her that way, and I can&#39;t figure out where the love and care she should have when she was a child went.//
&gt; 
&gt; //She saw a sentence in the book one day, and I was stung by that sentence: __&#34;A lucky person&#39;s lifetime is cured by childhood, while an unlucky person&#39;s lifetime is spent curing childhood.&#34;__//
&gt; 
&gt; //...I interfered. I gave her a happy childhood within the acceptable range.//
&gt; 
&gt; //She got better. A lot better, obviously better. That&#39;s it.//
&gt; 
&gt; //But, when I think that there may be more people like her before, I can&#39;t rest assured. Since then, I began to move frequently, trying my best to change and improve.//
&gt; 
&gt; //It&#39;s a pity... I tried too hard on this one. I made so many mistakes that I was discovered by you.//
&gt; 
&gt; //I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m really sorry.//
&gt; 
&gt; //But I have no regrets.//
