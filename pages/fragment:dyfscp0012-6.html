[[div style=&#34;border:solid 5px #855000; background:#FFFFFF; padding:15px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;&#34;]]
//(A crude ballroom has been built out of cubic chunks juxtaposed of Mt. Rushmore, juxtaposed into place by ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B. There is a large stage at the northern end with a podium constructed from the nose of the Abraham Lincoln face.)//

//(The audience is primarily composed of WerkHoss Units, humanoid robots based on the designs of crash test dummies. These robots comprise the majority of TotleighSoft&#39;s latter-day workforce.)//

//(The only non-WerkHoss attendees are a table of ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B delegates.)//

**WerkHoss Emcee:** ...well, I guess I //could// stay up here and keep making my jokes forever. But, I think we all know why you&#39;re really here. And now, addressing you as CEO for the last time, the extraterrestrial immigrant Cinderella story of the ages... Mr. Percival Hudson Gock!

//(Wild applause. A curtain raises over a massive lump of soggy, gelatinous yellow flesh on the stage. The WerkHosses sing.)//

**Audience:** //For he&#39;s a jolly good// [10 seconds of unintelligible shrieking in an unidentified, presumably extraterrestrial language]//, for he&#39;s a jolly good// [10 seconds of unintelligible shrieking in an unidentified, presumably extraterrestrial language]//, for he&#39;s a jolly good// [20 seconds of unintelligible shrieking in an unidentified, presumably extraterrestrial language]//, which nobody can deny!//

//(The emcee stabs an audio cable into Gock&#39;s frontal mass.)//

**Gock:** Okay, okay, sammer down, everybedy... My friends, when I first came to America to porsue my dream, I never imagined for a mament that I&#39;d be standing here on this stuge. In the span of only a few mellennia, TotleighSoft has gone from its hamble roots as a consumer electranics company fueled by psychic orgy of corpses -- to a globe-spanning consumer electranics empire!

//(Applause.)//

If you need a litmus tast for how much we&#39;ve grewn, you need only look at how my gresp of the Englosh language has improved! It&#39;s almost silly when I look at our begennings -- like, &#34;what the hall were you smuking, Percy?&#34;

//(Canned laughter.)//

In all sariousness, there comes a time when a great king must weep, for there are no langer anything left to canquer. (Thank you, Hons Gruber.)

//(Canned laughter.)//

And alas, yours truly has reached that poent. Besides, the market is constontly changing -- and on a reluted side note, we wouldn&#39;t have come half this fur if it weren&#39;t for the sudden appearance of our best frands and benefuctors, Weasel Eschatological Landscaping Solutions, LLC. Go on, show &#39;em some lave!

//(Applause toward the ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B table. Its occupants stand up and bow deeply.)//

The fact that the merket keeps chonging is proof that TotleighSoft needs someone yeunger in charge. I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve had to keap you in the durk about the idenitity of my succussor, but those who know me can agrea that it&#39;s really no secrat if you thonk about it.

//(A small procession of WerkHosses carry a purple velvet pillow onto the stage. In the middle of the pillow is the hard drive containing ##red|**RED**##.)//

Ludies and Gontlemen, please welcame the new CEO of TotleighSoft as she spends the naxt ten years slowly and panelessly replaceng my consciousness -- my beautifel daughter, Pallit East River Gock!

//(Wild applause.)//

//(A WerkHoss picks up the hard drive and jabs it into Gock&#39;s flank with an air of ceremony.)//

//(Once the hard drive is completely absorbed, Gock lets out an ear-splitting shriek from one of his inner vocalization glands, quivering and rippling violently. The ballroom shakes.)//

**WerkHoss Emcee:** Mr. Gock! What&#39;s wrong?!

**Gock:** What the holl are you duing, Pallit?! IT HARTS! //STEEEP!!//

//(An invisible shockwave knocks most of the audience on their backs. Gock&#39;s flesh darkens in color. A vertical crack forms in the top of his body, slowly expanding - until Gock&#39;s body reduced to a reddish-brown crust surrounding a translucent pink sphere of gelatinous matter. The crust still shows signs of life through vibrations.)//

//(##red|**RED**##&#39;s cartoon fairy body appears in the center of the sphere through bioluminescent holograms. She wrings the paintbrush on her left arm sadly.)//

##red|**RED:**## ...um, hello, everybody.

//(The crust slowly starts regain color and reshapes over the sphere -- but an opening is left wide enough for Pallit&#39;s entire body to be visible.)//

Sorry about the mess. Truth be told, due to very personal reasons, I was //kind of// in a hurry to destroy his consciousness. He&#39;s dead.

//(Panicked murmuring in the audience.)//

I know, I know, it&#39;s all very sad or something -- don&#39;t worry. Youâ€™re all fake humans anyway, so I&#39;ll just reprogram you to stop missing him once we&#39;re done here. Besides, I doubt you&#39;re going to miss him much after you find out what he did to all those humans in that car factory.

Anyway, since I&#39;m in charge now, I&#39;d like to say a few words before we get started.

//(She clears her throat.)//

As we blindly move forward into this new, horrible, empty, lifeless, disgusting, //human-free// era, my Dad liked to talk about talk about adapting to a changing world. It&#39;s kind of funny in retrospect. I guess having his consciousness replaced in a way he wasn&#39;t prepared for was just too //changey.// 

No doubt you&#39;ve seen for yourselves how much of a hypocrite he is. And now, here you are, dressing up like you&#39;re humans, while giving a standing ovation to humanity&#39;s murderers. 

Just //good business,// am I right?!

If you&#39;d like to know how I&#39;m going to lead you through this new and unfamiliar market, I just have four words for you.

//(She laughs, holding back tears.)//

There //is// no market! The market was created by the single most beautiful species of meat puppies ever to exist: the human race.

This rock we&#39;re standing on was barren for billions of years, spent a few million with an infestation of big, stupid lizards -- then as soon as humanity stepped into the evolutionary playing field, you couldn&#39;t walk around a corner anywhere without finding an artistic touch everywhere you look. It only took a couple dozen millennia to come up with penicillin, the Beatles, deep tissue massages, and //Wayne&#39;s World.//

Humans made everything beautiful.

The only real reason to murder them is out of some ass-backwards hatred for beauty.

//(A matted length of hairlike tendrils peeks out from underneath her, pointing to the ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B table.)//

So tell me. What is it about beauty that gets you little //shits// so hot under the collar? 

//(One of the ##orange|**ORANGE**##-Bs grabs hold of a nearby WerkHoss unit and takes control of its voice synthesizer.)//

##orange|**ORANGE##-B-1:** {{**[I understand.] [your] [discontent] ... [WEASELS?!] [do not wish for] [unnecessary] [confrontation] ... [Perhaps.] [I could] [offer an explanation] [of] [Why?!] [our mission] [is] [cruelty-free beef!] ... [clarification.] [minus] [The word] [beef]**}}

##red|**RED:**## Oh? Then juxtapose on up here, and let&#39;s talk it out.

//(##orange|**ORANGE##-B-1** teleports onto the stage.)//

//(##red|**RED**##&#39;s biomass suddenly rears up and slams onto ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B-1. The image of ##red|**RED**## within the sphere gains solid form, yanks ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B-1&#39;s body into the sphere and swallows it whole.)//

//(##orange|**ORANGE**##-B-1&#39;s viscera darkens the sphere. ##red|**RED**##&#39;s body flares up with light.)//

Huh. So that&#39;s how you juxtapose.

//(The remaining ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B start raising their arms and moaning.)//

I wonder what happens if I juxtaposed multiple objects into the same space?

//(##red|**RED**## juxtaposes the remaining ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B into a single position between them. Their still-living bodies have phased through one other. They struggle, groaning and shrieking.)//

//(##red|**RED**## giggles hysterically. She pokes at the twitching wad of captives with a tendril.)//

Maybe it&#39;s a little behind schedule. But I think my art has finally found its inspiration!

//(The rest of the audience, horrified, makes for the exits.)//

Well, since you guys have clearly had enough of your new boss already, I&#39;m gonna go ahead and turn on direct control.

//(The WerkHosses all freeze. They turn to ##red|**RED**## and salute her.)//

**WerkHosses:** Your orders, Master!

##red|**RED:**## Okie-dokie, my sweet little disgusting bootlegs, here&#39;s the deal: consumer electronics are normie shit. From this day forward, we&#39;re going to use this company as an elaborate performance art project called &#34;Ashen Shadows of Man - an Interactive Vortextual Dive into an Unblemished Legacy.&#34;

First, I&#39;m going to mindfuck the information I need out of the weasel wad. //~Abraca-die-biiitch~//

//(The ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B cluster levitates and glows, screeching pitifully. Glowing molten material suddenly ejects from their mouths before flash-cooling and hardening. Smoke shoots out from between segments of their carapace. The cluster falls, and all ##orange|**ORANGE**##-Bs in the wad are dead.)//

That was //very// informative. Thankie-wankies!

Let&#39;s review what I discovered: this planet is currently smack-dab in the middle of the weasels&#39; home dimension. It&#39;s about the size of Earth&#39;s solar system. The laws of physics are a little different, i.e. sound carries over from planet to planet, there&#39;s breathable air in space. There are a bunch of other kidnapped planets here, and none of &#39;em have any civilized societies. 

But here&#39;s where it gets //spicy,// fellas!

Ruling over the weasels as their resident God is a reality-warping super-weasel who lives out in space -- the one they call &#34;Grandma.&#34;

//(She strokes her chin pensively.)//

And because she trusts her &#34;grandchildren&#34; completely, there&#39;s nothing stopping anyone from juxtaposing into her brain cavity and taking control of...

...be right back.

//(She disappears in a juxtaposition event.)//

//(14 minutes and 45 seconds of dead silence.)//

//(The sound of the recording suddenly cuts out from a noise loud enough to short out the microphones.)//

//(When sound returns, ##red|**RED**##&#39;s voice can be heard from the sky.)//

##blue|**BLUE:**## **Sorry to keep you waiting. Now, let&#39;s talk about how to convey our message...**
