Invasion Progress
[[/div]]


**Item #:** [**{{Removed}}**]

**Object Class:** [**{{Removed}}**]

**Special Containment Procedures:** [**{{Removed}}**]

**Description:** Due to the current invasion of Foundation Facilities by PoI-001 (&#34;The Administrator&#34;), less than half of the files on the Foundation Database have been recovered by Foundation personnel and the creation of new documents is currently impossible.

This file, previously SCP-7878, is now used for an abridged catalogue of the current invasion and its progress. The document’s current edits will be given its own file and reverted back to their original content once Frederick William and all its instances are terminated.

While PoI-001&#39;s termination is a priority, Foundation personnel are to maintain usual containment on all Sites and areas currently occupied by us. Information concerning the means of termination of clones by PoI-001 can be found on //Termination Procedures of Hive-Mind Individuals// (previously SCP-2505&#39;s file).

**Attempt at communication:** The first Site recovery, Site-19, led to the discovery of Machina-V; an anomalous engine used by PoI-001 to clone himself, and the component known as the Human Noosphere Regulator. 

O5-1 proposed using his mind and connecting it to the Noosphere Regulator. Even if doing so was considered highly painful and possibly fatal, O5-1 successfully connected his mind to the Noosphere Bubble where PoI-001&#39;s mind is located.

Later, O5-1 attempted to contact PoI-001 through the Noosphere Regulator. The following is a short telepathic discussion between O5-1 and PoI-001.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

= **[Begin Communication]**

//PoI-001 is seen standing in the middle of a white void. He seems focused.//

//A silhouette of a man appears and blinks in and out of existence. PoI-001, noticing the silhouette, approaches it.//

**O5-1:** //H- (statics) T-// Test.

**PoI-001:** Siegle?

//The silhouette stabilizes.//

**O5-1:** Hello, Administrator.

**PoI-001:** ...You... You&#39;re not supposed to be here. 

**O5-1:** I always wondered what the inside of the noosphere would look like to the human mind. Pretty empty.

**PoI-001:** What are you doing?

**O5-1:** Isn&#39;t it obvious? I can see what you are seeing now. I know what you know. Every plan you think of to get rid of us, I&#39;ll think of it too. And we can prevent it.

**PoI-001:** You could have killed yourself that way. 

**O5-1:** War demands sacrifice. You can stop whenever you want and kill your original body to put an end to all of it.

**PoI-001:** ...What have you become, Siegle?

**O5-1:** I did not //became// anything, William. You are the only one who got on the wrong path, and I&#39;m here to fix this mistake. Saving the Foundation from you.

//No response of PoI-001.//

= **[End of Communication]**
[[/div]]

**Addendum.1:** O5-1 aided in the discovery of two other Machina-V at different Sites.

O5-1 proposed to raid each of these Sites first, before recovering other Sites and Areas, since PoI-001&#39;s instances will not decrease unless these devices are destroyed. Site-90 was the first on the list, and an attack was immediately planned. All personnel were given direct access communication to O5-1 via earbuds to avoid unexpected encounters.

Using grappling hooks, two agents were sent onto the roof without being spotted by surveillance cameras. They then use the entrance of the roof to enter the facility and proceed to terminate 25 PoI-001’s clones before accessing the main Site computer room and lock themselves in. Using a virus AIC uploaded on the security computer, they successfully open the main Site entrance, letting all Foundation members into the Site.

During the fight, PoI-001&#39;s instances are seen using rifles with non-lethal sedative bullets to stop the Foundation personnel.

Reality Bending agents were ordered to block all exits of Site-90 except for the main entrance, where other personnel enter. Thaumaturgical experts were sent in front with protective spells to defend. All other agents were ordered to terminate a maximum of PoI-001 while trying to find, if possible, better weapons throughout the facility.

In less than two hours, 2131 of the 2198 PoI-001 have been terminated. The rest are believed to have somehow evacuated. Personnel incapacitated were treated, but none were heavily harmed. Site-90 has been successfully recovered. All agents who terminated more than 40 PoI-001&#39;s clones were awarded for their behaviour.

**Attempt at communication:** Another attempt at communication between the two individuals connected to the Noospheric Regulator was initiated not so long after the attack of Site-90, this time with PoI-001 starting the conversation.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

= **[Begin Communication]**

**PoI-001:** Siegel.

//O5-1 doesn&#39;t respond.//

**PoI-001:** Siegel, I know you listen to me.

//Still no response.//

**PoI-001:** We must put an end to all of this. This is madness. We must not-

**O5-1:** -Or what? You&#39;re going to try and kill us? No. You won&#39;t even touch us. I didn&#39;t know your moral code went that far. I thought you would get pretty angry and break it after the second Site reacquisition.

**PoI-001:** ...This is going too far.

**O5-1:** It is only the beginning.

**PoI-001:** Your mind is obviously affected by the Regulator. You must-

**O5-1:** I won’t listen to your lies anymore.

**PoI-001:** Please! Just listen to me, Siegle. Just for once. I can make a deal with you if you want. Make it fair for both of us.

//Pause.//

**O5-1:** No.

**PoI-001:** What?

**O5-1:** What //you// want to do is not a fair deal. You want to accept the Foundation members back while still keeping your clones around to help. You will then show how your clones are efficient and are the only needed members of the Foundation. This will force most of the staff to quit, little by little.

Then, once most of us are gone, there will be those like me who would want to stay no matter what. You’ll amnestecize the rest of us to erase our memories of the Foundation. And you’ll be the only one left to take care of the Foundation.

**PoI-001:** No… that’s not-

**O5-1:** Do not even try to deny it. We share the same mind now, Frederick. I told you, everything you think about, I’ll think the same.

//No response from PoI-001.//

**O5-1:** Goodbye, Administrator. Do not attempt to communicate back until you have a real fair deal.

= **[End of Communication]**
[[/div]]

**Addendum.2:** Site-01, the last remaining Site with a Machina-V, was already set ready for another raid three days after the storm of Site-90.

According to O5-1, another attempt at discretely entering the Site would be impossible, as PoI-001 installed a large number of traps inside the facility. Instead, using all thaumaturgical specialists available, a ritual was performed to forcefully open the door.

As soon as they entered the Site, defensive agents holding Portable Scranton Reality Anchors were immediately targeted by PoI-001. Even with ontokinesis specialists on the field to deflect the bullets, the majority of the agents were neutralized. The devices were also shot along with the agent holding them, leaving the anchors unusable.

PoI-001 instances later used a device capable of mimicking Class-V Reality-Bending abilities. The use of the device resulted in a complete change of the structure of Site-17 and many other altering effects, including doors leading to a wall, the floor changing into a mud-like substance and all personnel being subject to hallucinatory vision.

Dr. Alto Clef, armed with a double-barreled shotgun, was impervious to the reality shifts due to his anomalous alterations. He was immediately ordered by O5-1 to destroy the mimicking engine. Clef accepted and ran in direction of Wing C while killing a maximum of PoI-001 instances. Even if multiple bullets were taken, Clef did not slow down. When accessing said room, Clef immediately shot in direction of the device, which stopped the effect throughout the Site. Clef suddenly falls onto the ground, unresponsive due to the sedative effect. All Foundation members resumed the attack.

Researcher Cole Thereven suddenly stops fighting, instead looks around, confused. When asked about what he is doing by a former colleague and friend, he responds &#34;Who are you?&#34;. Dr. Cameron Abbett drops their weapon and looks around, also confused similarly to Researcher Thereven. They continually ask around in panic where they are while looking for an exit.

More and more personnel were getting the same reaction as Cole and Cameron, and the attack on Site-01 was stopped and all agents were retrieved back to Site-19. 

18 agents, researchers and doctors inexplicably lost memory of everything related to the Foundation during the fight. --Another raid attempt will be initiated once the phenomenon will be neutralized.--

**Attempt at communication:** O5-1 attempted to communicate again with PoI-001, with the intention to find out more about the current loss of memory by Foundation personnel.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

= **[Begin Communication]**

//O5-1 screams loudly into the white void.//

**O5-1:** Administrator!

//No response.//

**O5-1:** I know you&#39;re here! Respond to me!

//The space around the overseer seems to bend with each scream. But no responses.//

**O5-1:** What have you done? What happened? Why didn&#39;t I see it?!

//No response.//

**O5-1:** Answer me! William!

= **[Extraneous Info removed]**
[[/div]]

O5-1 continuously tried to contact PoI-001 for three days straight, without any response.


**Addendum.3:**  At the time of writing, 104 Foundation personnel lost memory due to an unknown anomalous phenomenon induced by PoI-001. The following are all proposals executed by High Command in an attempt to eliminate this phenomenon.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Proposal #01:** Use of Class-W mnestics on affected individuals.

**Council Vote Summary:** **##green|13##** -- **##orange|0##** -- **##red|0##**

**Result:** Proposal accepted and applied. All personnel affected were unable to regain memory with Class-W or any type of mnestics, and were instead released from Foundation custody.
[[/div]]


[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Proposal #08:** Use of Machina-V to replace every lost personnel.

**Council Vote Summary:** **##green|7##** -- **##orange|1##** -- **##red|3##**

**Result:** Proposal accepted and attempted to apply. The machines were unable to perform other clones. Possibly rendered unusable by PoI-001 just before evacuating every facilities.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Proposal #14:** Via the usage of Foundation physicists, thaumaturgists, and theologists, attempt to contact a deity capable of blocking the anomalous phenomenon’s effect.

**Council Vote Summary:** **##green|5##** -- **##orange|0##** -- **##red|2##**

**Result:** Proposal accepted and applied. After attempting to contact several entities, only one responded back, and despite being capable of erasing the anomalous effect, refused due to &#34;already having a deal with Frederick William.&#34; Insufficient numbers of Foundation thaumaturgists foiled further attempts at communications.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Proposal #25:** Use of micro chip able to store memory, then surgically place it into the brain of Foundation personnel to forcefully regain memory loss.

**Council Vote Summary:** **##green|4##** -- **##orange|0##** -- **##red|1##**

**Result:** Proposal accepted and attempted to apply. Could not be achieved due to the lack of Biotech Researchers and Foundation Anomalous Integrated Circuits Specialists.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Proposal #33:** Contact PoI-001 and propose a deal fair for both parties.

**Council Vote Summary:** **##green|2##** -- **##orange|0##** -- **##red|1##**

**Result:** Proposal accepted and applied. No answer from PoI-001.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Proposal #41:** Via the use of temporal anomalies, send a message to past O5-1 before the beginning of the event that lead to now.

**Council Vote Summary:** **##green|1##** -- **##orange|0##** -- **##red|0##**

**Result:** After being the last one, I finally understood why this phenomenon happened. Fredrick somehow removed the concept of the &#34;SCP Foundation&#34; from the Noosphere. That’s why him and I are the only ones not affected, because of his fucking bubble.

It was pretty smart, I&#39;ll give him that. He basically forced them to live a life without the Foundation. I however have no idea how exactly he managed to hide it from me. I’m supposed to see everything he sees. A certain type of amnestics, perhaps?

Anyways, this message is not direct to The Administrator. This message is for you, Siegel. I sent all of this to you to make you understand the gravity of the situation. And to make you act as quickly as possible.

Kill him.

I would have done it myself, but that bastard did not leave me any anomalies able to send a human being into the past. That’s why you must do it.

Kill Frederick William, before he kills the entire Foundation. Go into Site-01, take the elevator, enter his office, and before he has time to react; shoot his head off. However, be aware that he might survive a shot in the head. We don’t know how many alterations he did to his body. Take anomalies with you in case. It might be hard, but you must do it.

After sending him six feet under, make sure to hide everything, don’t leave one trace. They will then search for someone to replace him. That’s when you will replace him. Become the Administrator, and only now we can ensure all of this war never occurs.

You do not have much time. Hurry.
