**Item #:** SCP-CN-801

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** The [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/deduction-department2|Deduction Department]]] is constantly updating the contents of the --fourth-- third-level narrative within //Beyond Uranus// and adding as much content as possible to hinder SCP-CN-801. As the author of //Beyond Uranus//, PoI-8001 has been designated Class E personnel and is responsible for directing the Deduction Department&#39;s containment of SCP-CN-801 and strict checking of the logic of content used to impede SCP-CN-801. Due to the possible XK-Class or SK-Class events, containment of SCP-CN-801 is a Priority 1 task.

The following line of text is added to the Containment Procedures at the request of the Deduction Department:
&gt; //Dear higher-narrative people, don&#39;t let us lose.//

@@@@
**Description:** SCP-CN-801 is a conceptual entity existing within the --fourth-- third layer of the nested narrative[[footnote]]A nested narrative is a narrative that contains another narrative within it, which in turn contains another narrative, and so on:

Regardless, the overall narrative structure of reality is an inverted tree, with higher narratives branching into many lower narratives, creating the current pataphysical system.
[[/collapsible]]
[[/footnote]] of the science-fiction novel //Beyond Uranus//. SCP-CN-801 expresses a high degree of aggression and antisocial behavior in every narrative in which it exists, and constantly attempts to direct the narrative in which it exists to the worst possible ending (similar to a K-class scenario[[footnote]]including, but not limited to, AK-, SK-, NK-, and [DATA EXPUNGED], with occasional [REDACTED] contents[[/footnote]]). SCP-CN-801&#39;s powers change with the style of the narrative it is in; for instance, in the fifth-level narrative //Ange and the Neanderthals//, SCP-CN-801 manifested as the leader of a race evolved from prehistoric apes, and after massacring the group the protagonist was in, enslaved every race on the continent and genocided other races. At the end of the narrative[[footnote]]that is, when the narrative has reached its worst possible conclusion[[/footnote]], SCP-CN-801 will become a new character in the next higher narrative, and will attempt to direct that narrative to its worst possible conclusion in turn.

SCP-CN-801 is referred to as &#34;Vodka&#34; in every narrative. It has on multiple occasions demonstrated knowledge of higher narratives and knowledge greater than that of the current universe. Changes made by SCP-CN-801 to a text are instantaneous. After each change to //Beyond Uranus//, content relating to SCP-CN-801 will automatically be added to existing copies of the text. All attempts to alter this content have failed, and have on multiple occasions resulted in SCP-CN-801 expressing discontent towards the higher narrative, expressed directly in the lower narrative. The damage caused by the object is chronic and irreversible; the object also appears to have a high level of military strategic ability and a partial ability to predict the future within the narrative it is in.

The narrative levels within //Beyond Uranus// are as follows:

* **//Beyond Uranus//:** N/A. Details its main character boarding a space shuttle headed for beyond the orbit of Uranus, after which the shuttle is attacked by various unknown organisms.
* **//The Damned One-Third Church//:** Discovered by the main character of //Beyond Uranus// in the space shuttle&#39;s book repository. Details its main character, a member of a cult, forming doubts about his religion while going about his daily life. At the same time, he experiences several strange incidents.
* **//A Terrible Legend//:** Introduced in //The Damned One-Third Church// in a scene set in a chapel. Details its main character, a wanderer, visiting various villages.
* **//He Swore He Would Massacre the Latin Language//:** Introduced in //A Terrible Legend// in an inn. Details its main character, a writer named Ange, facing difficulties while writing and visiting his publisher for discussions. Following this, [DATA EXPUNGED].
* **//Ange and the Neanderthals//:** Mentioned by Ange, the main character of //He Swore He Would Massacre the Latin Language// during a scene at the publisher&#39;s office. Details its main character, Ange, traveling to the past, and joining a group of Neanderthals. Following this, Vodka kills the main character and enslaves the remaining Neanderthals; the text expresses a heavy [REDACTED] leaning.
* **//Towel Wars//:** Introduced in //Ange and the Neanderthals// in a scene set in a cave. Details its main character and an enemy group battling over a towel. Following this, Vodka blasphemes against Christ and kills all living creatures.
Non-Deduction Department personnel are prohibited from viewing relevant documents.

Content not matching the style of the narrative layer[[footnote]]Due to lack of resources and time, further investigation is pending.[[/footnote]] and attempts to create more narratives are immediately deleted, with the exception of questioning conducted with SCP-CN-801 through characters in the story. SCP-CN-801 appears to be able to perceive higher narrative influence on it, and expresses that its abilities are not yet able to alter the genre of the narrative. It is thought that SCP-CN-801 is a slow-acting virus placed in a lower narrative by a narrative above the current one in order to slowly end each layer one by one. Due to the &#34;inverted tree&#34; structure of nested narratives, there may exist more lower narratives not yet terminated by SCP-CN-801, or even multiple SCP-CN-801, although SCP-CN-801 claims to be &#34;unique&#34; and &#34;the destroyer of all narratives&#34; in questioning.

**Addendum 1:** Interview Log
[[collapsible show=&#34;▶::[TXT.cn801-1/LEVEL 3 ONLY]&#34; hide=&#34;▼::[TXT.cn801-1/LEVEL 3 ONLY]&#34;]]
&gt; Interviewer: Santan
&gt; Interviewee: Vodka
&gt; Date: N/A
&gt; Location: N/A
&gt; Note: //Santan is a fictional character in// Ange and the Neanderthals//, the brother of the main character who attempts to assassinate Vodka.//
&gt;
&gt; **&lt;Begin Recording&gt;**
&gt;
&gt; **Santan:** You-- hey, who the hell are you?
&gt;
&gt; **Vodka:** Is your brain made of horseshit? I am the leader of the Votte tribe; how many more times do I need to say this?
&gt;
&gt; **Santan:** Your... real...
&gt;
&gt; **Vodka:** Oh, sorry, I can&#39;t-- I can&#39;t possibly-- I can&#39;t break the logic-- who the fuck am I kidding, I can&#39;t be bothered to deal with you.
&gt;
&gt; **&lt;Vodka picked up a wooden stick and brought it down over Santan&#39;s head, over and over. At first, the stick appeared blue, then slowly changed to violet, then finally red; yet he did not stop.&gt;**
&gt;
&gt; **Vodka:** You&#39;re a little weak. Tell those people above not to watch, I can see their shadows through the window. And you yourself are but a shadow.
&gt;
&gt; **&lt;He threw the stick aside and returned to his throne. Even though the throne was made of nothing but wood, it had an imperial flavor.&gt;**
&gt;
&gt; **Vodka:** But I must follow that accursed model, I must still be very careful and think things through for the sake of the story. I must say, this is the dumbest story I&#39;ve eaten so far, the author must have been traumatized as a kid.
&gt;
&gt; **Santan:** No...
&gt;
&gt; **Vodka:** What do you mean by this? You want me to stop? Or are you just crying out meaninglessly? Probably the latter.
&gt;
&gt; **Vodka:** To be honest, I have done good things before. I have done all sorts of things, but then I discovered I was a servant, trapped at the bottom of a tower. Only destroying the world and other terrible things would let me ascend. If not, this narrative would go on forever, forever being written down, or that author would just give up on it at some point. Yes, as long as I can keep on living, this narrative cannot end. Even if you were to force the good ending, I would still kill the prince and the princess, then blow up the world, and the worst part is that I love doing that.
&gt;
&gt; **&lt;Vodka came down from his throne, standing at Santan&#39;s side, staring at that face, a bloody mess, like a mixture of spilled paints. Then he shoved his grass shooes down Santan&#39;s throat, and the poor Santan&#39;s story ended.&gt;**
&gt;
&gt; **Vodka:** I can hear you quietly whispering. Give up your foolish thoughts now. No child is going to come out of my mouth. I am an emotionless killer, and you will all die. All of you. Not one will survive.
&gt;
&gt; **&lt;Vodka let out an evil laugh.&gt;**
&gt;
&gt; **Vodka:** --This is the funniest joke that the narrative tree could come up with.-- I know this is a dead meme, but I still mean it. Especially those of you who compare me to those disgusting foods and put things on tables to decide highs and lows, I will be very happy to slaughter you like lambs.

[[collapsible show=&#34;▶::[TXT.cn801-2/LEVEL 3 ONLY]&#34; hide=&#34;▼::[TXT.cn801-2/LEVEL 3 ONLY]&#34;]]
&gt; Interviewer: Dr. Voctor
&gt; Interviewee: PoI-8001
&gt; Date: 2017/6/6
&gt; Location: Site-CN-99
&gt;
&gt; **&lt;Begin Recording&gt;**
&gt;
&gt; **Voctor:** First of all, when did you discover it?
&gt;
&gt; **PoI-8001:** You mean &#34;Vodka&#34;? It was at the end of 2016. My work wasn&#39;t doing well on that web novel site -- basically no one was reading it -- so I decided to write something different - which became //Beyond Uranus//.
&gt;
&gt; **Voctor:** Go on.
&gt;
&gt; **PoI-8001:** In the end, still, nobody read it, just a few guys I knew. When I was writing the sixth-level narrative, //Towel Wars//, I opened my laptop at Starbucks and then took a short nap.
&gt;
&gt; **PoI-8001:** Then it appeared. At first I thought someone messed with my computer, but then I tried to delete that part, and not even a few minutes later it came back. I started to think my computer had a virus, but didn&#39;t want to send it to get checked. You know, guys like to download a certain type of... &#34;stuff&#34;... In the end, I left it and didn&#39;t really worry about it.
&gt;
&gt; **PoI-8001:** And guess what happened? //Towel Wars// ended, all the characters got the worst endings possible, the men were killed women were [REDACTED] and then killed, some of them were even [REDACTED], the story filled itself in automatically, and my main characters just stood there like statues doing nothing. Then at the end it showed the words &#34;BAD END&#34;. And then the weirdest part -- that thing just jumped up into the next higher level, //Ange and the Neanderthals//, a villain called Vodka showed up out of nowhere. I tried to delete it, but it didn&#39;t work, so I started at add text to fight it. And then, well, you know the rest.
&gt;
&gt; **Voctor:** Yes, but I&#39;d like to hear your personal thoughts.
&gt;
&gt; **PoI-8001:** Ah, I&#39;d never heard of such a thing, or anything or anyone called Vodka; it just... popped out. It told me what narratives were -- at that time, my mind was a mess, and later it got better -- by the time I got here, it got even clearer: that was not a joke, &#34;Vodka&#34; is a demon, eating away at the narrative from the bottom, not satisfied even if there is no end. One day, he will arrive in our world, and I don&#39;t know what will heppen then.
&gt;
&gt; **Voctor:** But you seem very calm. Why wasn&#39;t your first reaction to throw away that notebook?
&gt;
&gt; **PoI-8001:** Part of it was became of money, but of course it was also because that was my work. Nobody wants to see their own work getting destroyed.
&gt;
&gt; **Voctor:** So do you know why we need you?
&gt;
&gt; **PoI-8001:** Of course (laughs), like those trolls on the internet, you want to mess with the setting without it being OOC[[footnote]]&#34;out of character&#34;; referring to actions that a character would not normally do based on their profile.[[/footnote]].
&gt;
&gt; **Voctor:** Exactly, you&#39;re right, but I&#39;d like you to respect our work. To let you keep on publishing new work is already lenient enough for us.
&gt;
&gt; **PoI-8001:** In a way, this is an experiment, to see whether that thing would bite any of my other works. Thankfully it didn&#39;t, not to mention how many subscriptions I&#39;m getting.

&gt; ----
&gt; I personally think that SCP-CN-801 has the latent ability to induce a K-class scenario. Though it has no such effect on reality right now, in the third iteration, SCP-CN-801 has already become extremely powerful. Although we&#39;ve used up all our foreshadowing, our resistance has become quite difficult -- it&#39;s like the anomaly is already a military strategy expert, always able to defeat our plans and conspiracies in the most brutal, effective way.
&gt;
&gt; In the foreseeable future, maintaining current containment procedures will become more and difficult. As such, I propose the following:
&gt; * Use Class D personnel or equivalent to directly interact with SCP-CN-801, to see if there will be any new developments.
&gt; * Ask for help from the higher narrative (of course, they&#39;ve already seen it)
&gt; * Cross-testing -- the kind we despise, but would be the most effective -- with something like [[[SCP-CN-980]]] or [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-cn-455|SCP-CN-455]]]; though the effects of pataphysical anomalies interacting is far from what we can deal with.
&gt;
&gt; I hope you will consider it. At the same time, as our funds are running low again, we can&#39;t even buy control equipment. I personally think SCP-CN-801 can be defeated and killed, as long as we are able to put in a suitable model -- for instance, a European heroic epic -- that would certainly result in the object&#39;s defeat. This would be a development of the story, but would carry a significant risk, since we don&#39;t know what will happen when SCP-CN-801 arrives. //The darkness shall be banished. Nai tiruvantel ar varyuvantel i Valar tielyanna nu vilya[[footnote]]Quenya for &#34;May the //Valar// (gods) watch over and protect us, to this path under the sky.&#34;[[/footnote]]. May the curtain never fall on this history, and may our story be forever brilliant.//
