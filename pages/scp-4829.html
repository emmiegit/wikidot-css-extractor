**Item #:** SCP-4829

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures [##blue|UPDATED 9/20/2072##]:** Standard Class 4 (Nearby Celestial Object) disinformation protocols and image doctoring protocols apply. Containment personnel are to remain in Uranus&#39; orbit and monitor SCP-4829&#39;s state.

In the event that SCP-4829&#39;s containment staff deem neutralization necessary, one instance of [[[SCP-2501|SCP-2501-EX]]] will be immediately delivered to them from orbital storage by MTF Mu-119 (&#34;Red Squadron&#34;).

**Description:** SCP-4829 is Uranus&#39; moon Umbriel.

SCP-4829 repeatedly generates large, flower-like structures made of ice or rock along its surface; each of these structures measures up to 40 km tall and moves rhythmically for several months before sinking back below the surface. Routine probes determined that beneath the ice lies a gelatinous layer of dissolved hydrocarbons, proteins and enzymes.

On 9/19/2072, Foundation astronauts Chad Roland, Vanessa Marquez, and Monica Lorenz descended from Umbriel&#39;s orbit in a lander to investigate SCP-4829’s surface.

&gt; [The following log is transcribed from Monica Lorenz&#39;s bodycam.]
&gt; 
&gt; [**BEGIN LOG**]
&gt; (//The camera jolts as the lander touches down on Umbriel&#39;s surface.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Roland:** Mission Control, this is Skywalker. We&#39;ve landed half a kilometer from one of the structures.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mission Control:** Roger, //Skywalker//, we copy. Excellent job.
&gt; 
&gt; **Roland:** Stepping out.
&gt; 
&gt; (//Roland opens the airlock and climbs onto the ladder.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Marquez:** Performing thruster diagnostics, stand by.
&gt; 
&gt; (//Roland descends the ladder and steps onto the surface, with Lorenz following on the ladder.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Roland:** Surface appears- what the fuck?!
&gt; 
&gt; **Lorenz:** Are you alright?
&gt; 
&gt; (//Roland sinks into the regolith up to his knees, and his space suit dissolves. His body balloons and stretches into an ellipsoid shape as his skin becomes translucent white.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Lorenz:** Oh shit! Vanessa, get us out of here!
&gt; 
&gt; (//Lorenz climbs back into the lander and disconnects Roland&#39;s tether, throwing the remaining length out of the lander.//)
&gt; 
&gt; (//Roland sinks further into the surface and bursts, spreading white liquid across several square meters of ice. The liquid is pulled into the surface and the ground shakes.//)
&gt; 
&gt; (//Lorenz closes the lander door.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Marquez:** Fuck! 3, 2, 1, ignition!
&gt; 
&gt; (//The camera feed shakes as the lander takes off.//)
&gt; [**END LOG**]
&gt; 
&gt; **Postscript:** As Lorenz and Marquez returned to orbit, the surface of SCP-4829 cracked along the equator, causing vast amounts of lunar material to fall into the widening chasm. SCP-4829 continued to crack until it fully split into two identical, smaller instances of itself.

##blue|**UPDATE 9/21/2072:**## SCP-4829 is currently thousands of small moons attached to each other in a spherical arrangement, dividing roughly every 13 hours. Orbital data shows SCP-4829&#39;s constituent objects to be composed of cytoplasm, surrounded by shells of ice and rock.

##blue|**UPDATE 9/23/2072:**## Individual lunar structures now number beyond 20,000. SCP-4829 remains roughly the same size.

##blue|**UPDATE 10/11/2072:**## SCP-4829’s orbit decays further; causing it to fall into the ε ring (Uranus&#39; brightest ring). The ring material rearranges, sheathing SCP-4829 in a diffuse cloud while a stream of ice particles extends down to connect SCP-4829 with Uranus&#39; atmosphere. Gas from the atmosphere flows up the ice stream, covering SCP-4829 further.

##blue|**UPDATE 11/14/2072:**## SCP-4829 has deformed and is no longer spherical. Sensors indicate a rhythmic, repeating vibration generated by SCP-4829’s core at a rate of 110-120 beats per minute.
