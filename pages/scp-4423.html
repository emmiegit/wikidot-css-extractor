**Special Containment Procedures:** Development of containment procedures for SCP-4423 events is ongoing. Meanwhile, all such events are to be attributed to a unique form of sleep paralysis.

**Description:** SCP-4423 is a Tartarean-Class demonic entity that manifests during sleep paralysis. Although its appearance varies across manifestations, its voice remains the same (with speech patterns matching that of a middle-aged male).

During an SCP-4423 event, SCP-4423 will enter the victim&#39;s room and speak to them as if they were a young child. This conversation will inevitably turn to the topic of the victim&#39;s father. When the victim exits sleep paralysis, SCP-4423 will leave the room and demanifest. 

Due to the lack of reported incidents (with only fifteen confirmed cases since 1997), the frequency of SCP-4423 events is currently unknown. While the extent of SCP-4423&#39;s interactions with the victims varies greatly, many seek psychiatric help following an incident.


**Interview Log:** In order to obtain an interview, Researcher Jack Patricks volunteered to be subjected to an experimental drug capable of inducing sleep paralysis. By using a prototype neural interface capable of translating thoughts into synthetic speech and a camera system mounted in his room, an interview was conducted after 77 consecutive days of testing.

**Interview Video Log Transcript**

**Date:** 14/10/2015 

**Subject:** SCP-4423

[BEGIN LOG]

//Camera set within Researcher Patrick&#39;s room shows the Researcher, a bed, as well as several posters on the wall.//

**[6 hours removed for brevity.]**

//The sound of a door opening is heard, followed by footsteps. SCP-4423 appears in the frame and sits at the end of Researcher Patricks&#39; bed and crosses its hands in its lap. After observing Researcher Patricks for a period of 3 minutes, SCP-4423 touches his ankle and shakes it until Patricks opens his eyes.// 

**SCP-4423:** Hey kiddo. Sorry to wake you up, but I need to talk to you.

**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Hello.}}

//SCP-4423 jumps slightly.//

**SCP-4423:** Oh wow! You frightened me. Another one of your crazy toys, huh?

**Researcher Patricks:**  {{I. Am. ... Foundation.}}

**SCP-4423:** Yes. Foundation. That&#39;s what I want to talk to you about. 

**Researcher Patricks:**  {{You. Know.}}

**SCP-4423:** I know a lot of things. There&#39;s a good deal of wisdom in this old horned head of mine. [ //Tugs on one of its horns// ] Relationships? They gotta have a strong foundation.

**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Oh. Kay.}}

**SCP-4423:** And I wanna get to know you, buddy. A little us time, you know?

**Researcher Patricks:** {{Why.}}

**SCP-4423:** Well... uh... [ //Coughs// ]

**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Questions.}}

**SCP-4423:** Saved me there. Alright, I&#39;ll answer some of your questions while I try to think up how to say it.

**Researcher Patricks:**  {{How. You. Move.}}

**SCP-4423:** You know that. My old jalopy. I musta driven you to school three dozen times by now.

**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Where. You. From.}}

**SCP-4423:** Here. Went to the same high school as you, remember? Showed you my old yearbooks.

**Researcher Patricks:**  {{No. Really.}}

**SCP-4423:** Yeah really. Okay. I think I&#39;ve got it now. Your dad and I? Well, we&#39;ve been seeing each other for a little while. I know, I know, we&#39;ve been friends for, well, ever.

**Researcher Patricks:**  {{William.}}

**SCP-4423:** Yes, Bill. And when I say &#34;seeing each other&#34;, I mean dating. 

**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Oh.}}

**SCP-4423:** I, uh, figured you mighta caught on but I wanted to talk about this with you, sport.

**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Oh. Kay.}}

**SCP-4423:** Look, I love your father. He completes me in ways I didn&#39;t even know I needed. [ //Pause// ] After puberty is over, it&#39;ll make more sense.

**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Sexual. Relations.}}

**SCP-4423:** Hey, who told you about that? Didn&#39;t think Bill gave you the talk yet. But, yes. Sexually too.

**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Oh. Kay.}}

**SCP-4423:** I don&#39;t want to just jump into your life like a stranger. I&#39;m not a housewrecker. I wanna be part of your life, in a mutually positive relationship. So we need a good foundation.

**Researcher Patricks:**  {{How.}}

**SCP-4423:** I know your parents went through a pretty nasty divorce a little while ago. And that you haven&#39;t seen your mom in a while. I don&#39;t want to replace her. I never could. 

**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Explain.}}

**SCP-4423:** I want to ask your permission.

**Researcher Patricks:**  {{For. What.}}

**SCP-4423:** Jack... I want to marry your dad. If you&#39;re okay with it, I&#39;d be honored to be your stepdad.

**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Step. Dad.}}

**SCP-4423:** Yes, your stepdad. Just say yes and I&#39;ll propose tomorrow. 

//SCP-4423 covers its mouth with its hands and giggles//

**SCP-4423:** I can just see him, all dressed up in a tight little tux. You can be the ring bearer, little buddy. So, what do you say?

**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Yes.}}

//SCP-4423 grabs Researcher Patricks, pulls him into a hug, and kisses his forehead. SCP-4423 laughs, tucks Patricks back into bed, and then exits the room.//

**SCP-4423:** Ah! You said yes!

[END LOG]

**Closing Statement:**  Following extensive interviews, Foundation researchers concluded that while he had passed through Las Vegas on [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4661 15/1/1992], Researcher Patricks&#39; father has not engaged in sexual intercourse with any Tartarean-Class demonic entities[[footnote]]As of December 4th, 2015[[/footnote]].

**Addendum:** Ten months after the interview, a photograph depicting SCP-4423, William Patricks, and Researcher Jack Patricks in formal attire inside of a church was discovered underneath Researcher Patricks&#39; bed. The picture showed Researcher Patricks as he appeared when he was twelve and Patricks recognized the church as the one he attended as a child in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. 

Mobile Task Force Upsilon-11 was dispatched to the church and found a wedding announcement in the records for one William Patricks and an unnamed second person, dated 14/8/1999. No members of the clergy recall conducting or witnessing the wedding and Researcher Patricks has no memory of this event taking place. 

**Addendum:** On 30/8/2019, Researcher Patricks received a postcard (postmarked 14/8/2019 in Oranjestad, Aruba) from his father. 

&gt; Hey Jack!
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry that I didn&#39;t give you any notice, but your stepdad and I decided to celebrate our anniversary in the Islands. Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been twenty years already. Maybe you can join us next year, if you can get away from that job.
&gt;
&gt; Love, Dad
&gt; 
&gt; P.S. If you get a chance, can you check on Misty? That cat sure misses you and I don&#39;t want Mrs. Arnsdale overfeeding her again.

Compiled surveillance logs from the city of Oranjestad show William Patricks and SCP-4423 checking into a hotel and participating in other activities standard for vacationing couples. The current whereabouts of William Patricks remains unknown.
