There is no evidence of any other remaining tissues of the native body. The nerves and vessels themselves are intact, with proper anatomy, suggesting uninterrupted physiology until the time of medically-induced brain death. The remaining tissues are coated in a viscous, mucoid-like substance that has a high concentration of anti-microbial immune cells, denatured human DNA, monosaccharides and polysaccharides. The biofilm is likely the residue of previously intact tissues that were xenochemically liquefied while functional.}}**
