&gt; &#34;Okay. That...that sounds like a good plan.&#34;

She leaves the basement as you advise caution. That she looks around every corner before she moves on, that she checks behind her regularly. 

She reaches the backyard -- this is going well, better than your previous attempts. It wasn&#39;t in her house this time, it&#39;s the furthest she&#39;s got in a while. Maybe there&#39;s hope. 

&gt; &#34;I&#39;m scared.&#34; 

You are too, but you don&#39;t say it.

She jumps the fence, the woods are ahead. A small smile breaks across her face as she breaks into a run. The forest is dense, but she keeps good pace as she darts through-

She shrieks as she falls to the ground, face first into detritus. Blood flows from the deep cut in her leg torn open by the garotte wire stretched between two tree trunks.

&gt; &#34;No, no! Oh god no!&#34;

She grasps at the wound with her hands in a futile effort to stem the bleeding. 

It emerges from behind a tree -- black burlap sack over its face, black overalls covering its body. 

&gt; &#34;What do I do, please tell me what I should do!&#34;

The question is screamed at you, but you have no answer; you stutter nothings in response as it approaches her. 

It raises a kitchen knife. The girl screams. The tape cuts to black.

= It always ends the same.
