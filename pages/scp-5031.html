+++ NOTE: FILE UNDER REVIEW.

**This document has been flagged for possible methodological issues. Please be aware that the following information is subject to change and may contain inaccuracies.**
[[/=]]

------

**Item #:** SCP-5031

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5031 is to be contained in an airtight iron cell in Bio-Site 59. The structure must be inspected for imperfections on a bi-weekly basis. No other interaction necessary.

**Description:** SCP-5031 is a non-sapient quasi-humanoid creature of unknown origin. When directly observed, SCP-5031 will temporarily cease to exist until the viewer stops observing the space that SCP-5031 formerly occupied. Traces of its existence (e.g. scratch marks, blood trails) continue to exist when SCP-5031 does not. Video and photography devices do not capture SCP-5031&#39;s appearance; however, observing SCP-5031&#39;s shadow does not cause cessation of existence, allowing certain physiological traits to be inferred from its silhouette:

* Abnormally small head with no discernible neck
* Elbows branch into three sets of lower arms each
* Elongated torso approximately 1.9 meters in length[[footnote]]Presumably for extra digestive capacity.[[/footnote]]
* Pelvis terminates in a crescent-shaped protrusion of osseous tissue with a bladelike lower edge
* Levitates above the ground at a fixed height of 0.5 meters

While SCP-5031 has no nutritional needs, it will nevertheless hunt and consume any human or animal it encounters by using its pendulous lower body to down targets. SCP-5031 does not sleep and is incapable of expression or verbal communication.

**Addendum:** As of 14/02/2018, Senior Researcher Stanley Huxtable is now acting in the role of HCL Supervisor for SCP-5031. The following is a selection of relevant correspondences from SR Huxtable to Site Director Youssef Mostofi elucidating research progress.

[[div class=&#34;note&#34;]]
14/02/2018
= **[[size 150%]]{{INITIAL IMPRESSIONS}}[[/size]]**

I have no idea who wrote this, but there&#39;s a lot I&#39;d like to say to them. I&#39;m not a fan of abandoning a living creature inside a metal box for ten years, no matter how pragmatic it may be. 

It&#39;s difficult to fathom that such things were considered the norm a decade ago. Have you ever heard something scream from behind ten inches of iron for hours on end? When I do my redraft, remind me to add &#34;anomalous resistance to hoarseness&#34; somewhere in the description. 

Could you work your magic and get the boys to retrofit the &#34;containment cube&#34; with an aperture and security vestibule? I&#39;d like to run some tests that require exposing SCP-5031 to certain stimuli. 
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;note&#34;]]
08/03/2018
= **[[size 150%]]{{ROUND 1 TESTS (SOUND) - SUMMARY}}[[/size]]**

**Foreword:** Installed speakers in the containment vestibule and played various albums of natural ambiance and popular music. SCP-5031&#39;s propensity for screaming worked as a convenient way to measure its stress levels: 100% would be considered its typical screaming (volume and duration) over 48 hours and 0% would be no screaming at all.
@@@@
@@@@
||~ Selection ||~ Stress Level ||
|| Morning Forest Ambiance ||= 43% ||
|| Seaside Paradise Ambiance ||= 48% ||
|| Deep Grotto Ambiance ||= 62% ||
|| The Best of Mozart ||= 13% ||
|| The Best of Enya ||= 18% ||
|| The Best of Ben Folds ||= 6% ||
|| The Best of Jethro Tull ||= 59% ||
|| The Best of KISS ||= 23% ||
@@@@
@@@@
**Afterword:** Efficacy of music for stress reduction gradually decreases over time. I&#39;ve assembled a playlist of SCP-5031&#39;s favorite music to play on shuffle in its enclosure in perpetuity. Stress levels consistently remain in the 15%-25% range. Baseline adjusted accordingly. 
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;note&#34;]]
22/03/2018
= **[[size 150%]]{{ROUND 2 TESTS (PLAY) - SUMMARY}}[[/size]]**

||~ Test ||~ Result ||
|| Threw softball into enclosure. ||  SCP-5031 sliced the ball in two. ||
|| Tossed basketball into enclosure. || SCP-5031 sliced the ball open. ||
|| Rolled bowling ball into enclosure. || SCP-5031 scratched a couple of grooves into the ball, then rolled the ball around the enclosure with the blunt end of its tail for 20 minutes. Stress levels remained &lt;60% after play. ||
|| Rolled another bowling ball into enclosure. || SCP-5031 used the blunt end of its tail to hit the balls together for a while. Stress levels remained &lt;40% after play. ||
|| Bowling ball chipped and would no longer roll properly. (Unplanned.) || Stress levels increased to ~115%. ||
|| Replacement bowling ball provided. || Stress levels fell back to ~40%. ||
|| Tossed basketball into enclosure. || SCP-5031 picked up and played with ball. Stress levels remained &lt;20% after play. ||
@@@@
@@@@
**Afterword:** SCP-5031 began to use its hands to play with the basketball, possibly to avoid accidentally damaging it. Motor skill comparable to that of a toddler. SCP-5031 still prefers bowling ball for &#34;kicking&#34;. 

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;note&#34;]]
05/04/2018
= **[[size 150%]]{{ROUND 3 TESTS (FOOD) - SUMMARY}}[[/size]]**

**Foreword:** SCP-5031 was given the choice between two potential food sources placed at opposite ends of the enclosure. 
@@@@
@@@@
||~ Choices ||~ Selection ||
|| Human corpse / Pig carcass || Pig carcass ||
|| Pig carcass / Chicken carcass || Pig carcass ||
|| Pig carcass / Rotisserie chicken || Rotisserie chicken ||
|| Chicken carcass / Rotisserie chicken || Rotisserie chicken ||
|| Live chicken / Rotisserie chicken || Rotisserie chicken ||
|| Roasted turkey / Rotisserie chicken || Neither (presumed sated) ||
@@@@
@@@@
**Afterword:** While it&#39;s true that SCP-5031 doesn&#39;t necessarily need to eat, feeding it regularly has caused a marked decrease in average stress levels. Stress reduction seems to scale proportionally with the quality of food provided. 

Also of note is that SCP-5031 prefers to use its tail to pry and cut meat into bite-sized portions, rather than rip the meat into chunks with its teeth or hands. 
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;note&#34;]]
12/04/2018
= **[[size 150%]]{{ROUND 4 TESTS (COEXISTENCE) - SUMMARY}}[[/size]]**

**Test 1:** SCP-5031 fed until sated. Live subject (common chicken) introduced to enclosure. 

**Result:** SCP-5031 observed subject from a distance for several minutes and then rolled a bowling ball toward subject at high speed. Subject was killed instantly. SCP-5031&#39;s stress levels rose immediately and drastically. 
@@@@
@@@@
------
@@@@
@@@@
**Test 2:** Bowling balls removed from enclosure. SCP-5031 fed until sated. Live subject (common chicken) introduced to enclosure. 

**Result:** SCP-5031 gently rolled a basketball toward subject. Ball hit subject lightly. Subject responded with a small cry and moved away. SCP-5031 did not engage with subject any further.
@@@@
@@@@
------
@@@@
@@@@
**Test 3:** SCP-5031 fed until sated. Live subject (Class-D) blindfolded, introduced to enclosure, and instructed to sit and roll basketball forward, then wait until it came back and roll it away again.

**Result:** Subject and SCP-5031 successfully rolled the ball back and forth for several minutes. SCP-5031 eventually abandoned the activity and approached subject. Per safety protocol, subject removed their blindfold to terminate the activity. 
@@@@
@@@@
------
@@@@
@@@@
**Test 4:** SCP-5031 fed until sated. Live subject (Class-D) introduced to the enclosure and instructed to toss a tennis ball at the wall, let it ricochet behind them, then catch and repeat.

**Result:** SCP-5031 stood behind subject and successfully engaged in game of catch, mimicking subject&#39;s action of letting ball ricochet against the wall. 
@@@@
@@@@
------
@@@@
@@@@
**Afterword:** SCP-5031&#39;s motor skills appear to be rapidly improving.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;note&#34;]]
16/05/2018
= **[[size 150%]]{{ROUND 5 TESTS (SYMBOLS) -  SUMMARY}}[[/size]]**

**Foreword:** Five LCD displays were fitted into the wall of SCP-5031&#39;s enclosure, each with a lit button and a food dispenser underneath. 
@@@@
@@@@
------
@@@@
@@@@
**Test 1:** Two stations activated. Screen 1 displayed the image of a rock. Its button dispensed rocks. Screen 2 displayed the image of a rotisserie chicken. Its button dispensed pieces of chicken.

**Result:** SCP-5031 poked at the image of a chicken for a few minutes and eventually hit the button. Chicken was dispensed until SCP-5031 was satisfied. 
@@@@
@@@@
------
@@@@
@@@@
**Test 2:** Screen displays and the materials dispensed were swapped.

**Result:** SCP-5031 hit the button it had hit the previous day and received a rock. It then went to the other screen and hit the button to dispense chicken. 
@@@@
@@@@
------
@@@@
@@@@
**Test 3:** Screen displays and materials dispensed were swapped back to their original positions and set to swap again at random intervals after first distribution.

**Result:** SCP-5031 went directly to the button next to the image of a chicken. Experienced apparent confusion after the first mid-distribution swap, but quickly learned to watch the images. 
@@@@
@@@@
------
@@@@
@@@@
**Test 4:** Three more stations (screens, buttons, dispensers) were activated. Four stations displayed the word &#34;ROCK&#34; and dispensed rocks. One station displayed the word &#34;CHICKEN&#34; and dispensed chicken. Arrangement set to change randomly several times over the following days.

**Result:** Through trial and error, SCP-5031 determined which station dispensed chicken. SCP-5031 subsequently went to the station marked &#34;CHICKEN&#34; whenever displays were swapped. 
@@@@
@@@@
------
@@@@
@@@@
**Test 5:** All stations deactivated except one. Screen displayed the word &#34;CHICKEN&#34;. Seven wood blocks were set in front of the station, each marked with one of the letters in the word &#34;CHICKEN&#34;. The station&#39;s button was set to remain unlit and inactive until the blocks were arranged in the correct order.

**Result:** SCP-5031 expressed apparent frustration, hitting the inactive button repeatedly and striking the wall with its tail.
@@@@
@@@@
------
@@@@
@@@@
**Test 6:** Same as previous test, but screen displayed the word &#34;CHICKEN&#34; with each letter overlaid on a photo of a wood block.

**Result:** After 12 minutes, SCP-5031 successfully assembled the word &#34;CHICKEN&#34;. 
@@@@
@@@@
------
@@@@
@@@@
**Afterword:** It can learn language, Youssef. 

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;note&#34;]]
29/08/2018
= **[[size 150%]]{{ROUND 6 TESTS (VOCABULARY) - RESULTS}}[[/size]]**

**Foreword:** SCP-5031 has learned to use letter blocks to form the following words:

||||||~ Foods ||
||= CHICKEN ||= TURKEY ||= PORK ||
||= TOFU ||= BEEF ||= BREAD ||
||= MORE SALT ||= MORE PEPPER ||= MORE COOKED ||
@@@@
@@@@
||||||~ Music ||
||= MOZART ||= ENYA ||= BEN FOLDS ||

@@@@
||||||~ Play ||
||= BASKETBALL ||= BOWLING BALL ||= TENNIS BALL ||
||= CAT ||= DOG ||= HUMAN ||
||= ROBERT[[footnote]]D-52125.[[/footnote]] ||= STANLEY ||= ALONE ||
@@@@
@@@@
**Afterword:** Through its increased vocabulary and human interaction, SCP-5031 has made the following progress:

* Established food preferences and dish pairings
* Learned to sing (nonverbally)
* Learned to juggle (six-handed juggling is something to behold)
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;note&#34;]]
05/10/2018
= **[[size 150%]]{{ROUND 7 TESTS (ACTIVITIES) - SUMMARY}}[[/size]]**

**Test 1:** Introduced table, paper, and crayons into the enclosure. Live subject (D-52125) instructed to demonstrate drawing for SCP-5031.

**Result:** SCP-5031 learned to draw. Discernible subjects depicted in its artworks include D-52125, SCP-5031, a rotisserie chicken, a cat, and myself. 
@@@@
@@@@
------
@@@@
@@@@
**Test 2:** Introduced piano into the enclosure. Live subject (D-52125) instructed to play //Chopsticks// blindfolded and invite SCP-5031 to play along. Subject had time to practice beforehand.

**Result:** SCP-5031 learned //Chopsticks// in two days, though it appeared more interested in making its own original music (complete with vocals). These compositions might be considered crude by human standards. 
@@@@
@@@@
------
@@@@
@@@@
**Test 3:** Introduced spice rack into the enclosure. Live subject (D-52125) instructed to demonstrate seasoning meats.

**Result:** SCP-5031 spent almost three straight days experimenting with different combinations of foods and spices. SCP-5031 assembled the words &#34;MORE MORE MORE&#34; with its letter blocks after running out of garlic powder.
@@@@
@@@@

------
@@@@
@@@@
**Afterword:** SCP-5031 only engages with art and music when accompanied by D-52125, but it continues to be preoccupied with food preparation even when alone. 
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;note&#34;]]
04/01/2019
= **[[size 150%]]{{ROUND 8 TESTS (COOKING) - RESULTS}}[[/size]]**

**Foreword:** Basic kitchen utilities installed in enclosure.[[footnote]]Sharp implements withheld per security protocol. SCP-5031 used its tail to cut food.[[/footnote]] Live subject (D-52125) instructed to demonstrate preparation of various recipes. 

||||||~ Recipes Learned ||
||= Quesadilla ||= Taco ||= Hamburger ||
||= Fried Rice ||= Mongolian Beef ||= Spicy Chicken Curry ||
||= Chocolate Chip _
Cookies ||= Sponge Cake with _
Buttercream ||= Fudge ||
||= Clam Chowder ||= Steak ||= Macaroons ||
||= Chicken Adobo ||= Smoked Salmon ||= Profiteroles ||
@@@@
@@@@
**Afterword:** SCP-5031 has a severe peanut allergy. This should be included in the revised containment procedures. I would also like to note that SCP-5031 is now a better chef than the average human, and it has begun to create its own recipes. D-52125 has volunteered to taste test.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;note&#34;]]
30/06/2019
= **[[size 150%]]{{UPDATE}}[[/size]]**

SCP-5031 has said its first word: &#34;Salt&#34;.

We are all immensely proud.

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;note&#34;]]
29/11/2019
= **[[size 150%]]{{FINAL TEST - SUMMARY}}[[/size]]**

SCP-5031 was given two months to develop a three-course meal to serve at the Bio-Site 59 cafeteria for personnel working over Thanksgiving. Its selections were as follows:

||~ First Course || Sweet potato-turmeric miso soup. ||
||~ Second Course || Duck confit with apple cider glaze and cranberry compote topping, paired with butternut squash gnocchi on a bed of kale seasoned with truffle salt. ||
||~ Third Course || A slice of spiced cassava pie topped with french vanilla ice cream and a maple-hazelnut syrup. ||
@@@@
@@@@
SCP-5031 also debuted its original composition //Piano Sonata For Six Hands// in a live performance broadcast from its enclosure. Personnel response was overwhelmingly positive. SCP-5031 stress levels at 0%. Testing successfully concluded. Revised documentation submitted for approval.
