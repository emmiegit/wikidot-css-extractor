+++ Tresday, Nineteenth Cycle, Seventh Year, 81st Turn
++++ Forty-Ninth Day in the Trees

We left Maish&#39; home early in the morning.  He was glad for our company, and when we stopped for lunch, we found that he had placed pastries filled with meat and cheese in our packs[[footnote]] Most Untkin are like Maish Trascible, kind, generous, and good hosts.  Most. [[/footnote]].  I would suspect our nocturnal visitors, but I had seen him preparing these last night.  I hope that I can pass by his home again to thank him.

Torne began to skip around me during lunch, singing his annoying, cheerful songs.  I snapped at him to stop, growling at him.  He looked hurt, but stopped.

I wish that I had not done so.  Torne is a good friend.  But today, I feel ill, and my patience is short.  I apologized when I had calmed somewhat.

Is this the rut?  I am old enough, now, but this is not the right time of the year.  The rut should only come in the spring, and only if there is a female present.  Perhaps it is the strange seasons of this land affecting me, but still, there is no female here.  My balance should not be so upset.

Beyond that, my new robes feel tight.  Have they shrunk?</textarea></pre>
