||**//~The Right Honorable Order of the Wandsmen~//** ||

[[=image symbol.png]]

[[tabview]]
[[tab ~Introduction~]]
Welcome everyone, please take your seats. Note, if you experience any lingering transformation pains and need to leave during the lecture, please feel free to do so. A marker has been placed on your maps to allow the teleportation command to place you smoothly back in your beds. There is no shame in needing more time to recover, so please do not strain yourselves.
-----
Allow me to formally welcome each of you to the Wandsmen. We are an organization dedicated to bringing the news and the truth to all those who seek knowledge, students of all that is and teachers to all who will listen.
-----
We&#39;ve been the Multiverse&#39;s best source of information and explanations for untold eons and even in these trying times we remain dedicated to bringing the true stories of the worlds we explore to the multiverse at large. The news is a vital institution in a universe as complex as ours, so we do our best to preserve and promulgate all the knowledge we can find so it is not lost to the void.
-----
Now I know you must have a lot of questions, but please hold them until the end of the lecture. So to start-
-----
12th Wandsman of Reedsing, we&#39;re not forcing you to be here. If you&#39;re just here to disrupt-
-----
12th Wandsman of Reedsing! I have read your file. You did not find a [[[scp-5917|lost map]]]. You got told exactly what this was like from another Wandsman, and you had the chance to back out while the transformation was ongoing. You clearly wanted your map&#39;s power more than you wanted your old flesh.
-----
Look, I can understand buyer&#39;s remorse. Believe me, I get it. If you need time to process or counseling...
-----
And... he&#39;s gone.
-----
What? No, following him wouldn&#39;t help. With any luck he&#39;ll come back to our dimension when he&#39;s blown off some steam. If he doesn&#39;t... we&#39;ll cross that bridge when we come to it.
-----
Moving on...
[[/tab]] 

[[tab ~Your Body~]]
Look... I&#39;m going a bit off book here, but after that fiasco at the start, I think it would be best if we addressed the elephant in the room. 
----
All of you are probably quite anxious about your recent bodily changes. Know that every Wandsman in the multiverse has felt the sting of dysphoria from time to time.
-----
When one takes up the map, their body shifts into a more avian form. Specifically, you take the quasi-humanoid form of a bird that you previously found repulsive. There are a few theories as to why that is. Perhaps the cartographers of eons past who enscribed the first maps and passed them down to us wanted to change our perspectives. Or perhaps they just wanted to teach us some humility before they granted the map&#39;s gifts...
----
Frankly there are millions of review articles written in our journals with different theories. No one really knows why it happens.
-----
Regardless, your new form has many advantages. You will be able to understand others with greater acuity, your bodies have been strengthened, age is a thing of the past, and most, if not all of you. have been granted the gift of flight. 
-----
If you&#39;ve shrunken down to the size of a Canary, fear not. It just means your body has been granted the elusive power to explore the strange and twisting wonders of time. You can slip through cracks in reality which us larger Wandsmen may never even notice, and even have cartographic potential.
-----
Or perhaps you were lucky enough to end up like me. I know, I know... it can be strange talking to someone so large, but we mighty Rocs have the strength to lift up a thousand libraries if needed. Some of the multiverse&#39;s stories require great force to unearth, and we Rocs help provide it.
-----
Even those of you with middling sizes are commonly granted unique and curious abilities ranging from an instant understanding of language to echolocation. You may think your form a curse, but it is truly a blessing!
-----
...
-----
I suppose I can&#39;t say that with a straight face and be called a seeker of truth.
-----
Still, fear not, things like &#34;beauty&#34; are ultimately a matter of perspective. Remember: you all took up the map because there was something in the infinite halls of knowledge that you wanted to see far more than you wanted to recognize the person in the mirror. 
------
And before you ask, there is no cure, no going back that we know of. Yes people have tried. Most of them aren&#39;t with us anymore... 
-----
Know that you are surrounded by those who suffer in similar ways. And one can, over the years, adjust. 
------
You can even find love. My husband and I have been writing articles together for over six hundred years, and the eons of time we still have before us make me very happy I took this shape.
[[/tab]]

[[tab ~Name Security and Magic~]]
I know you all joined because you had a desire to explore the multiverse and a tell your tales. We will get to that. But before anything else, we have to establish some safety rules. Your new bodies are hardened against many hazards, but one major unusual threat to your safety in this line of work is the theft or exploitation of your name.
-----
There are two major strategies when protecting one&#39;s name. One is to simply never give it out, or give it only to those you trust most in the world.

I follow this method, so you may call me the Third Wandsman of the Wanderer&#39;s Library. By now, you should all have been assigned a title and a number based on your place of origin. This title has been thaumaturgically hardened, so even the most potent name thieves cannot take it from you. 

I strongly recommend this strategy during your first few centuries.
-----
The other strategy is to promulgate your name to all who would hear it and add title upon title to yourself so as to strengthen the name&#39;s power. My colleague [[[a-wandsman-in-the-court-of-the-hanged-king|Ickis the Wayward, Wandsman of Kul-Manas - Walker of the Astral Plane, Sailor of the Celestial Sea, and Spelunker of the Dimensional Depths]]] is fond of this strategy. 

He claims it allows him to use his name as a sink for the backflow of his magics, but you&#39;d have to speak to him about the details. Name magic may be powerful, but it is also quite dangerous.
-----
However, there are many other magics that you may find useful to employ. Your mind has been sharpened by your transformation. So the higher physics of reality should be relatively easy for you to pick up.
-----
I certainly encourage you to take advantage of our back issue library of ritual workings.  We also run courses on magical studies for all Wandsmen who wish to partake of it.
-----
What is Thaumaturgy? Something as diverse as magic does not lend itself to summaries, but suffice it to say it is a method of manipulating reality based on your ability to comprehend it. That is of course a gross oversimplification... But I fear the full details fall outside the bounds of an introductory lecture.
-----
But no matter how quickly you master the arcane arts, do not get cocky. Magic will be an invaluable tool as you document the stories of other worlds, but you must not rely on it. There are many powers in the world you shall need to come to understand if you&#39;re going to survive this line of work. Thaumaturgy is merely a piece of the puzzle. 
[[/tab]]

[[tab ~Equipment and Roles~]]
Obviously, the first and most important piece of equipment you will need to familiarize yourself with is your map.
-----
The map you hold is a map of the Known Multiverse. Our cartography team is working around the clock to keep it up to date, but there is still so much to explore!
-----
Obviously, by speaking the name of a place on the map you can teleport to it. As you gain more intimate details of the objects and persons in a dimension you&#39;ll even be able to &#34;target&#34; your precise destination. For this reason, among several others, doing your homework is important! Every century we lose something on the order of fifty Wandsman who thought it was a good idea to jump into an incredibly hazardous dimension unprepared. The lucky ones end up in solid rock faces. Don&#39;t be like them.
-----
Another major map safety concern is that prolonged exposure to the image on any map can make those whose minds are not properly prepared suffer severe vertigo and headaches, which I&#39;m sure many of you have already encountered while you adjusted to them during your transformations 
-----
As for other field equipment, we have workshops and catalogues a plenty for you to assemble your equipment from, and I do know the Eighth Wandsman of Hui runs excellent seminars on the creation of magical items.
-----
Generally speaking, basic resources are easy to acquire for smaller projects, it is part of your benefits package after all, but if you want to build something truly massive to aid in your explorations and the writing of your articles, you may need to request approval from the Editors.
-----
Who are the Editors you ask?
-----
Our organization is perhaps best described as a &#34;Co-op&#34;. What this means is that our leaders and several key positions within our organization are elected, and everyone is considered to have partial ownership of our libraries.
-----
This does not mean you can just take whatever you want from our stores or, knowledge forbid, destroy any of our books, but you can requisition things like lodging and necessities with relative ease from the company coffers so long as you do not abuse these privileges.
-----
A few of the more notable roles within our organization are as follows:

**Reporters:** This is the most common role a Wandsman performs. These are those who wander the multiverse to record its stories. All Wandsman have at least some experience in this role.

**Hawkers:** These are the Wandsmen who sell (or, with approval, provide at no charge) our newspapers and magazines to all the inhabitants of the multiverse who have a chance to understand them. This is a difficult job, but a needed one. One must be both salesman and teacher to bring in the resources we need to maintain operations.

**Raptors:** &#34;Army&#34; is an inadequate word to describe them. These are the Wandsmen who uncover dangerous ruins and explore hostile dimensions. They will save lives (and thus minds, and thus knowledge) wherever they can and provide security for our organization. There are many entities and forces in the Multiverse that work against us. These are the brave souls who hold the line against such darkness.

**Arbiters:** Of course, violence is best reserved as a last resort. When interacting with other organizations or populations it is often in our best interest to take a more diplomatic approach to doing our reporting. Arbiters are elected for certain &#39;difficult&#39; regions to sort of &#34;smooth things over&#34; for the local population.

**[[[scp-5946|Cartographers:]]]** This is a position that requires a certain... Attunement to the multiverse at large. Cartographers are responsible for mapping the various dimensions that surround us and pathfinding or tunneling ways between them. This job requires a great deal of magical knowledge to execute, as well as certain... additional transformations that many find distasteful. It&#39;s rare to see a cartographer with less than a millennium of experience.

Canaries can be a minor exception to this. They often find themselves sent out as scouts into strange new dimensions and locations of temporal distortion. However they can carry very little with them on such voyages, and the multiverse can be a dangerous place for birds so small.

**Editors:** Now we get to the meat of the discussion. Once every 500 years, an election is held for the editorial board. The next one is coming up in 86 years and you&#39;re already seeing some campaign poems get floated around.

The editors are in charge of day to day operations, approving story assignments and directing the flow of our resources. At the end of the day they&#39;re in charge... though between you and me they listen to the cartographers a bit more attentively than the rest of us...
----
Sorry, I shouldn&#39;t be bringing internal politics into the classroom. At least not yet.
-----
Also, let me assure you, there are no &#34;Grand Cartographers&#34;. I have been here for Millennia and I haven&#39;t seen so much as a feather of them anywhere. No one knows who started our organization. If you want to join the legion of Archeologists trying to figure it out, be my guest, but trust me on this... I spent a good century of my misspent youth trying to find them, and the farthest records back we have stretch only 3.7 billion years. Not even [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/ my old home] had records of them. It gave the librarians quite a scare when I asked.
-----
I know it&#39;s in all our nature to try and make sense of every mystery, but all I got out of those decades of digging was a few ghost stories and a nagging headache. Trust me, don&#39;t waste your time.
[[/tab]]


[[tab ~Code of Conduct~]]
It is best to think of these as... Guidelines more than rules. You should follow them 99% of the time, but we will need myriad different perspectives in order to find the truth and I don&#39;t want to quash yours with hard and fast rules.
-----
That said, if you deviate from the code too much, you&#39;re definitely going to end up getting questioned by your colleagues, perhaps even the editors if you&#39;ve truly drifted too far.
-----
**1) Preserve as much knowledge as possible**
If you have the opportunity to learn something, take it. And make sure to record it as well.

**2) Spread knowledge as much as possible**
If you have the opportunity to teach someone else something, take it. Be aware that educating an unwilling mind is an extremely difficult task, so gaining the trust of those around you is quite important here.

I should note, you are not obligated to teach an intensive seminar on how to make nuclear weapons to toddlers. Make the information available, but be prudent. We&#39;ve had [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5687 enough fiascos].

**3) There is no such thing as &#34;bad&#34; knowledge, merely knowledge we have not found a way to comprehend yet**
You will learn many horrible things working for our organization. You will even encounter knowledge that seems to posses its own will and a desire to harm you. Contain these things if you can. We [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ have acquaintances] that can help with that.

**4) Treat other perspectives with respect, especially when you disagree with them**
Note, if the perspective is &#34;I want to have you for lunch&#34; you don&#39;t have to immediately let a creature devour you out of respect. Rather, try to understand why the creature wants your flesh. Perhaps you can provide it with an alternative. Perhaps then you can get its story.

**5) Destroy knowledge as little as possible**
This can be more difficult than it first seems, and honestly it seems quite difficult. Books and minds and concepts can all seek to harm you and everything you love. We know sometimes you will have to destroy them to preserve other knowledge, but try to do this as a last resort.

**6) Be careful in Red Zones**
A &#34;Red Zone&#34; is a place known to be ruled by a greater entity, such as [[[scp-2264|Alagadda]]] or [[[larue-hub|La Rue Macabre]]] (although the greater being ruling the latter is much more amicable). These places require some clever negotiations to enter at best and can be instantly fatal upon entry at worst. As much as I love my dear Ickis, working the Red Zone beat has made him a fascinating combination of paranoid, over-prepared and insane. Frankly that&#39;s the most rational way to be if you want to explore some of the multiverse&#39;s more terrible places.

**7) Don&#39;t think you&#39;re alone**
Look... I know it sounds flippant, saying that we Wandsmen are family, but we genuinely are a team, and all of us have suffered to become part of it. When you burn out researching a story, ask for help. And help your colleagues whenever you can. Further still, help other thinking beings if you can so long as you&#39;re not helping them on a path of destruction. Accept help from them too.

You aren&#39;t alone in this.

[[tab ~The Coming Dark~]]
##d6d6d6|The entire Hytoth is coming to an end! Drop whatever you were planning on scribbling about and do something to stop it!##
Now now! Settle down everyone! Panic will not help us. Believe me, we&#39;ve tried it.
-----
##d6d6d6|Blast it WL3, have you been reading the Gazzette lately!? The Demiurge alone- ##
Yes Third Wandswoman of the [[[second-hytoth-hub|First Hytoth]]], we are well aware of the situation. Frankly you didn&#39;t need to burst into our orientation meeting to explain-
-----
##d6d6d6|Suji, please... I know it probably won&#39;t happen in the next five seconds, but they need to know.##
Well... I suppose that&#39;s fair.
-----
Listen well hatchlings... Things are not great. There are many organizations in the multiverse that seek to end it. A book is worthless without minds to read it and neither can exist in a world that doesn&#39;t.
-----
There are many researchers in our organization that claim time is running out for just about everything. 
-----
We are... scholars for the most part, not warriors. But it is unquestionable that right now the multiverse needs saving and we have a responsibility to be part of that. Whether we choose to do that by forging alliances between those who call this place home, warning the people and the gods so they can prepare or even charging into battle ourselves...
-----
There will be nothing to learn and nothing to explore unless we keep it safe.
-----
##d6d6d6|Thank you.##
You&#39;re welcome. Are there any further Questions? 
[[/tab]]

[[tab ~Article Formatting~]]
Writing Periodicals for us can be a somewhat loose experience. The **//Wandsman&#39;s Gazette//** is a collected publication of all of our recent works and the only hard and fast formatting rule required by the editors for otherwise uncategorized articles is that the following be  placed at the bottom: 

[[div style=&#34;display: block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#000000 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px&#34;]]

//Originally published in the Wandsmen&#39;s Gazette on [DATE]//
 [[footnote]] The date is to be localized to appear as the standard date format for the reader&#39;s location and must change based on that location. The runes to do this are available in the &#34;formatting&#34; section of the back issues archive, along with the runes for local translation to the reader&#39;s preferred language. Ask for the 23rd Wandsperson of Leothin, they&#39;ll sort you right out. [[/footnote]]

[[/div]]

But there are some more popular recurring articles that have specific formatting needs.

Starting with Lighter Fare, **//Game On!//** is an excellent column written by the 15th Wandsman of Pasia (with guest contributors showing up from time to time). Here he reviews the latest interactive experiences in the multiverse. 


[[div style=&#34;display: block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#000000 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px&#34;]]

@@[[=image game_on_logo.png]]@@

//Originally published in the Wandsmen&#39;s Gazette on [DATE]//

[[/div]]


A more personal interest oriented column is **//Traveling the Ways with Allora-7//**.

Obviously, the Seventh Wandsman of Allora is the primary contributor for this series of articles exploring the daily lives of the inhabitants of the lesser-known cracks of the multiverse, but he has been known to accept thoughtful articles from other contributors.

&gt; **__What&#39;s all this about?__**
&gt; 
&gt; The Wandsmen are a GoI focused on reporting on anomalous events and preserving knowledge. They have joined the fight to defend the multiverse from destruction largely because of their desire to preserve knowledge.
&gt; 
&gt; The Wandsmen are very flexible to write for. Their morality is generally decent, but it can be very alien (imagine preserving knowledge by turning someone into a brain in a jar. Some Wandsmen would think this was terrible, but many of the more alien Wandsmen just &#34;Wouldn&#39;t think this was the best method because it restricts those minds from experiencing new things and gaining more interesting information.&#34; It certainly wouldn&#39;t be seen as an inherently evil act by the Wandsmen at large).
&gt; 
&gt; Currently the organization in general is trying to befriend the Foundation as they see them as potential allies in the fight to avoid all their books getting burned, but there&#39;s a lot of tension around this because a lot of Wandsmen also want to write about Earth&#39;s stories and distribute their magazines.
&gt; 
&gt; In short, there is some inherent diplomatic conflict in the setting.
&gt; 
&gt; If you have any questions about the GoI and writing for it. please reach out to  [[*user chaucer345]] for details!</textarea></pre>
