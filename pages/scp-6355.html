**Special Containment Procedures:** Per its contract, SCP-6355 is entitled to an annual wage of £25.000 before taxes. It is further entitled to a personalized healthcare package, tailored to its unique physiology and exclusively to be employed at Foundation clinics.

SCP-6355&#39;s containment cell has been moved to the edge of the GBENWM-Site-02 Containment Wing, and is retrofitted with the amenities appropriate for an employee of its station. Twice per day, SCP-6355 is permitted to occupy the body of a coworker as they take their meals; to this end, at least three employees of the Fire Suppression Department must be on kosher meal plans at any one time.

Further benefits have been provided to SCP-6355:
* SCP-6355 may make purchase requests, either for its cell, its media library, or as gifts.
* On Friday nights, SCP-6355 is permitted to occupy the body of brain-dead personnel to attend worship services.
* Once per month, SCP-6355 is permitted to travel to a city within 200 km, provided it occupies a member of, and allows itself to be escorted by, Mobile Task Force Sigma-25 (&#34;Ghostbusters&#34;) reserve personnel.
* SCP-6355&#39;s use of its anomalous abilities in the process of work will not be counted as breaches of containment.

Should SCP-6355 leave its position with the Fire Suppression Department, see Document 6355-Q for secondary containment procedures.

**Description:** SCP-6355 is an abnormal instance of Spectral Entity Of Interest-040 (&#34;Mazzikim&#34;), i.e. an invisible, non-sentient spirit associated with deleterious spectral activity. Unlike baseline instances, SCP-6355 is uniquely sapient and self-directed, irrespective of background Malakhic Radiation. 

SCP-6355 identifies itself as a remnant of &#34;Avigail&#34;, a Jewish resident of late 12th-century York. Previously, SCP-6355 resided within Beth Ahm Yisrael, a Conservative Jewish synagogue [[footnote]] Hereafter purchased by the Foundation, and known as Site-6355-A.[[/footnote]].

SCP-6355 is capable of inducing physical, mental, and spiritual distress upon sapient subjects. This form of malicious behavior is typical of Mazzikim; however, SCP-6355&#39;s sapience allows it far greater control over its ministrations. 

At present, SCP-6355 is employed with the Fire Suppression Department.

{{[BEGIN LOG]}}

//MTF-Σ25 and Researcher Cunningham enter Site-6355-A through the north synagogue entryway. The group proceed down the nave, and begin setting up their equipment in the chancel.//

//Footage begins to distort. MTF-Σ25-01 through MTF-Σ25-04 slow their work, and become fixated on their own bodies. Gradually, all MTF members begin frantically brushing, waving, and scratching at their uniforms. Researcher Cunningham only stares at their hand.//

**Command:** Report. Captain, **report**.

**MTF-Σ25-01|Watts:** Bugs. There are- //(static, frantic scratching over coms)// bugs in our suits, Command!

**Command:** Ground yourself, Captain. Feed shows no &#34;bugs&#34; anywhere. Listen to me, you&#39;re perfectly-

//Feed is interrupted by static. Once re-established, feed shows MTF-Σ25 and Researcher Cunningham covered in welts, blisters, and dark bruises. MTF-Σ25-03 begins to shake.//

**Researcher Cunningham:** Fascinating.

**MTF-Σ25-01|Watts:** Command, equipment says this is an SEI Mazzikin. We should //not// be here without a ritual chalice...

**Command:** Negative, Captain. A Mazzikin would have immediately-

**Unknown Voice:** //(From all directions)// HERETICS. BUTCHERS. SUFFER AS I HAVE SUFFERED. FLEE IN THE MERCY I WAS NEVER SHOWN.

**MTF-Σ25-01|Watts:** Command, subject is //sentient//. Repeat, this is a //sentient Mazzikin//. We&#39;re retreating. Move out - I said move out, now!

//MTF-Σ25 and Researcher Cunningham quickly evacuate Site-6355-A. Cunningham pauses briefly in the main atrium, looking back. The figure of a young girl is seen hovering over the Altar.//

**Researcher Cunningham:** Yes. I think this will do.

{{[BEGIN LOG]}}

//Video begins. The blood of a properly slaughtered sheep is poured into a silver chalice, and a Malakhic Entity is called to occupy it. Shortly thereafter, a drop of pig&#39;s blood is mixed into the chalice, rendering it ritually unclean; the resulting Akiva vacuum forces SCP-6355 to occupy its place.//

**SCP-6355:** You insult me.

**Cunningham:** I&#39;m sorry, Avigail. Truly. We had to ensure our own safety.

**SCP-6355:** Ridiculous notion. There&#39;s terror to be had. G-d willing, there&#39;s terror to be had.

**Cunningham:** You don&#39;t think you&#39;ve spread enough already, Avigail?

**SCP-6355:** I don&#39;t. You don&#39;t talk quite like them. Your skin&#39;s darker. Bet they did to your kind what they did to me. Still, you&#39;re with them. You&#39;d set fire to the tower all the same.

//Researcher Cunningham nods, remaining silent for several seconds while they write something in their notebook.//

**Cunningham:** //(...)// So, how does it make you feel?

**SCP-6355:** Don&#39;t feel anything. Burnt off.

**Cunningham:** Not literally, Avigail. When you terrorize a human, be it sickness, madness... any kind of mortal terror, what goes on in your mind? You //do// have a mind, no?

**SCP-6355:** I.

//SCP-6355 pauses, and remains inert for several seconds.//

**SCP-6355:** Good. Feels good. Feels right. &#34;//Hashem yikkom damam//&#34;, I believe they call it.

**Cunningham:** Excellent. 

//Researcher Cunningham nods, and jots something into their notebook.// 

**Cunningham:** So, what if I told you that your terror isn&#39;t as much of a problem as the last two weeks might have lead you to believe?

//SCP-6355&#39;s vessel rattles.//

**SCP-6355:** Should&#39;ve known. Should&#39;ve known. They were lambs. You want this too.

**Cunningham:** I suppose I do, Avigail; If you&#39;ll oblige.

//SCP-6355 remains inert for several seconds.//

**SCP-6355:** Tell me what.

On February 28th, 2000, the revised SCP-6355 employment project was approved by the Fire Suppression Department, and subsequently enacted throughout Site-02.

A review of the first three weeks indicated that SCP-6355&#39;s efficacy had surpassed that of the previous system by a considerable amount: transfer and resignation requests were withdrawn 23% faster, and employee disobedience was reduced by as much as 37%.

//Director Cunningham nods, and remains silent for several seconds.//

**Director Cunningham:** How would you feel about someone else&#39;s body?

**SCP-6355:** I... want my own.

**Director Cunningham:** In the interim, though. Unused bodies are somewhat difficult to procure. We&#39;ll see what we can do. For now, keep up the good work.

**SCP-6355:** See what I can do.

**SCP-6355:** My body.

**Cunningham:** Hm? What about it, Avigail?

**SCP-6355:** I want my body. A body. Out. I want my body, and I want to leave. You promised.

**Cunningham:** I assure you, we&#39;re working on it. Truly. Please, be patient.

**SCP-6355:** Liar. False witness. Traitor. Bearing the weight of //your// sins. Have decency, Cunningham.

**Cunningham:** Do //you// feel guilty, Avigail?

**SCP-6355:** It weighs on me. I don&#39;t have a body. 173 bones in //your// body, //you// can stand up. I //have no bones//, Cunningham. I feel every sin.

**Cunningham:** You&#39;ve performed admirably, Avigail. I don&#39;t see why--

**SCP-6355:** Spineless fucking coward!

//Video footage begins to distort.//

**SCP-6355:** Have you cried for the Temple? Have you mourned the countless dead? Have you begged //anyone// to forgive you? How I&#39;d love to be able to drop to hands and knees, beg forgiveness for the excess vengeance I&#39;ve extracted on //your// part! Give me this! Let it not be in vain!

//Video footage is consumed by static, before gradually returning to normal. Both remain silent in the interim. Site Director Cunningham clears their throat.//

**Cunningham:** This is very upsetting behavior, 6355. You&#39;ve been an exemplary asset to this department up until now, and I think we continue to do good work. Truly. Now, are you going to comply?

**SCP-6355:** No.

//Site Director Cunningham nods.//

**Cunningham:** Very well.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6355 is to be sealed within a 2x1m fire-proof casket, kept inside a live incinerator at all times. The Foundation Department of Cremation Services has been instructed to inscribe a Gematrian binding to all cadavers slated for incineration, and ensure SCP-6355 is forcibly possessing said corpse prior to burning. 

A two-way speaker has been installed within SCP-6355&#39;s casket, connected directly to the Department of Fire Suppression.

//Video begins. The blood of a properly slaughtered, prion-free stag[[footnote]] Blood supply exhausted for domestic sheep (extinct). [[/footnote]] is poured into a silver chalice, and a Malakhic Entity is called to occupy it. Shortly thereafter, a drop of pig&#39;s blood is mixed into the chalice, rendering it ritually unclean; the resulting Akiva vacuum forces SCP-6355 to occupy its place.//

**Cunningham:** Hello, SCP-6355.

//SCP-6355 remains inert for several seconds.//

**SCP-6355:** Hi.

**Cunningham:** How&#39;s work?

//SCP-6355 remains inert for several seconds.//

**SCP-6355:** Fine.

**Cunningham:** That&#39;s good to hear, 6355. Truly.

//Controller Cunningham looks down at their papers, righting them, then continues.//

**Cunningham:** Congratulations on your 80th year with the Fire Suppression Department. You&#39;ve done some excellent work. Truly. Now, we&#39;ve been-

**SCP-6355:** Can I stop?

**Cunningham:** Working on- Hm? 

**SCP-6355:** Can I just... stop? I&#39;m ancient, not stupid. This isn&#39;t efficient, or rational, or right with Him. I know I&#39;m never getting my body back, so... how much longer do I have to do this? When can I stop?

//Both remain silent for several seconds.//

**Cunningham:** We&#39;ve been working on a new slate of tasks for you, 6355. You&#39;ll find your instructions in the usual-

**SCP-6355:** I don&#39;t want to do this anymore. I want to stop.

//The Controller pauses, aligning a pencil on their desk.//

**Cunningham:** So you&#39;d like to go back into the fire, then.

**SCP-6355:** No. No.

**Cunningham:** Do you want to go back into the fire?

**SCP-6355:** No. No, I--

**Cunningham:** Because if you don&#39;t want to work anymore, 6355, I&#39;ll have to send you back into the fire. Is that what you want?

//SCP-6355 is inert for a moment, then begins shaking. Spectral dimensions reduce 28.6%. A soft moaning, and quiet sobbing persists for two minutes. The Controller organizes their stack of files.//

**Cunningham:** Are you ready to get back to work, 6355?

**SCP-6355:** //(quietly, while sobbing)// Bring me back to the tower... give me to Sheol...

**Cunningham:** Answer me, 6355. Are you ready to //get back to work//?

//3 seconds of silence.//

**SCP-6355:** Y-... yes. I am.

**Cunningham:** Good. I&#39;m very glad to hear that.

//Controller Cunningham reaches over, and places a green stamp on the corner of the topmost document.//

**Cunningham:** Truly.
