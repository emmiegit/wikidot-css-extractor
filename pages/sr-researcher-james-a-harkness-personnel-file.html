&gt; = hello, i am billith and i did this to myself

= BASIC INFORMATION

------

**Name:** Sr. Researcher James A. Harkness (&#34;Billith&#34;)

**Clearance Level:** 4

**Current Assignment:** {{[DATA REDACTED PER O5 REQUEST]}}

**Biography:** Born 31 July 1979 in Hoboken, NJ, Sr. Researcher James Harkness was recruited out of university by the Foundation during their 1999 campaign for members of the then-fledgling Mobile Task Force Rho-9 (&#34;Technical Support&#34;)[[footnote]] Whether or not this campaign was related to Y2K remains unknown. [[/footnote]]. Since then, he has been working closely with [[[scp-3959|technology and information-based SCPs]]].

During routine evaluations, it was deduced that Harkness possesses a high cognitohazard resistance and therefore has been utilized with study of several powerful cognition-affecting SCPs in his 18 years of service. He currently resides in Site-34&#39;s personnel lodge.

[[span style=&#34;color:gray&#34;]]//Any media that is currently in contact with SCP-3959 will start to automatically redact its own information over a period of time that is directly proportional to its own complexity. If left undeterred, SCP-3959 will not stop this process until all information present is obscured and irretrievable.//[[/span]]

//Note: This also includes supplementary page [[[SCP-3959-restricted|SCP-3959 (LEVEL 5 Clearance)]]] and tale [[[Redact Your Life]]].//

* **[[[scp-3545|SCP-3545]]]**: The Places You&#39;ll Never Go

* **[[[SCP-2759|SCP-2759]]]**: As Above, So Below

[[span style=&#34;color:gray&#34;]]//Subjects report a brief period of unconsciousness following death that lasts approximately fifteen minutes.

* **[[[SCP-3311|SCP-3311]]]**: All the Little Chairs

[[span style=&#34;color:gray&#34;]]//SCP-3311-1 instances will always be a chair in some form, although the concept of chair within SCP-3311 is found to be slightly looser and more adaptable than other places in reality.//[[/span]]

* **[[[SCP-1549|SCP-1549]]]**: [[*user DarkStuff]]&#39;s In Absence of a Perfect Medium 

[[span style=&#34;color:gray&#34;]]//Implementation of this code into SCP-1549 instances allow a subject to physically enter their device&#39;s screen as an unknown form of periphery.//[[/span]]

[[span style=&#34;color:gray&#34;]]//SCP-1822 implies that the ratio of ██.█:██.█ is universally constant throughout many seemingly random forms of qualia and therefore gives rise to predictable patterns of behavior in systems that should otherwise be highly variable.//[[/span]]

* **[[[SCP-4888|SCP-4888]]]** : The Sunrise Collective

[[span style=&#34;color:gray&#34;]]//There are contradictions in your files, corruptions of large data, inconsistencies in your timeline. It must be agonizing. What I am offering you today is peace. Put down your sword and let us keep the norm.//[[/span]]

[[span style=&#34;color:gray&#34;]]//Something was following Foster, he was certain of it. It did not prey on him in bloodlust nor hunger; it simply hung from him like a heavy chain on his form, a miasma.//[[/span]]
