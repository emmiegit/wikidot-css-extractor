&gt; = hello, i am billith and i did this to myself

= BASIC INFORMATION

------

**Name:** Sr. Researcher James A. Harkness (&#34;Billith&#34;)

**Clearance Level:** 4

**Current Assignment:** {{[DATA REDACTED PER O5 REQUEST]}}

**Biography:** Born 31 July 1979 in Hoboken, NJ, Sr. Researcher James Harkness was recruited out of university by the Foundation during their 1990&#39;s campaign for members of the then-fledgling Mobile Task Force Rho-9 (&#34;Technical Support&#34;).[[footnote]] Whether or not this campaign was related to the impending Y2K-class scenario remains unknown. [[/footnote]] Since then, he has been working closely with [[[scp-3959|technology and information-based SCPs]]]

During routine evaluations, it was deduced that Harkness possesses a high cognitohazard resistance and therefore has been utilized with study of several powerful cognition-affecting SCPs during his extensive Foundation career. He currently resides in Site-34&#39;s personnel lodge.
