**Item #:** SCP-6916

**Object Class:** Apollyon

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6916 must have at least four (4) high ranking guards at all times (paragraph 4: Entry 1#). In case of a breach, SCP-6916 must be escorted to safety first at all times no matter the situation. In case of death of the SCP-6916, everybody who has ever heard about SCP-6916 must be terminated immediately and their body must be disintegrated on atomal level possibly via SCP-101 or ███████████.

Any personnel that will/will try/will manipulate someone to hurt/kill SCP-6916 or damage it&#39;s current containment must be terminated.
There are no exeptions including O5 council.

SCP-6916 is to be contained in extra secured humanoid cell with air filtration and cameras facing all walls and doors.

**Description:** SCP-6916 is a human individual named █████ ███████.

------Height: 183 cm

------Weight: 87 kg

------Sex: Male

------Hair: Brown

------Eye colour: Brown

SCP-6916 is a former class 4 senior researcher who was trying to recreate S.G. incident in wich he gained mowers similar to those of D-9341 (more about S.G. incident on tape &#39;&#39;S.G.-1&#39;&#39;).

S.G.-1:
4.5. ████ - I...I can set time stamps with just my mind and then... I can go back to that moment... I need more time.

6.5. ████ - It&#39;s been two (2) days since I&#39;ve done this... experiment and... it seems that the dimension that I have chosen is emmm... ah... *cough* *cough* the right one. I&#39;ve got powers from one of the beings in that dimension where time doesn&#39;t exist so... yeah... I think council knows about me... if I&#39;m gonna be declassified... it is my fault... but,but I don&#39;t regret it at all, I mean... I may even go back in time aven after my dead if my theory is right so... yeah.

█.█. ████ - I&#39;m not gonna remember anything but I hid some clues for myself so... *cough* I may find out who i was... Spiral Gestalt experiment was successful...
(end of the tape)

Unlike D-9341 who had no connection to &#39;&#39;The ENTITY&#39;&#39; in our dimension, SCP-6916 is connected to multidimensional entity from this point reffered to as &#39;&#39;SCP-6916-1&#39;&#39; much like a portal through his mind to our world. Also unlike D-9341 who was ██████ ██████, SCP-6916 is consideret as a threat with possible triggering of XK-Class End-of-the-World Scenario due to SCP-6916-1 (more information in file &#39;&#39;SCP-6916-1&#39;&#39;)

SCP-6916-1:
Is a multidimensional being/entity described by SCP-6916 as &#39;&#39;...omnipotent with all powers imaginable...&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;...destroyer of the worlds...&#39;&#39; (full conversation on tape &#39;&#39;SCP-6916 #1&#39;&#39;)

Dr. Tadeáš Burian had found it to be true after ████████ research done via [DATA EXPUNGED].

After research done by Dr. ██████ ███, it seems like SCP-6916-1 is not able to go to our dimension while SCP-6916 is alive possibly due to ████████ or █████████.

It seems that SCP-6916-1 is absorbing life, reasoning on why is unknown

SCP-6916-1 must not reach out to our dimension by any means.

[DATA EXPUNGED]

SCP-6916 #1:
Interviewer: So... how do you feel mr. ███████?

SCP-6916: I feel the same... most of the time... you know, sometimes I get visions from the... Let&#39;s call it &#39;&#39;Flipside&#39;&#39;. I see stars but... not really... their moving in patterns that I don&#39;t understand... yet.

Interviewer: [DATA EXPUNGED]

SCP-6916: No,no... I don&#39;t think that [DATA EXPUNGED]. No... it can&#39;t be... [DATA EXPUNGED].

[FATAL ERROR]

(end of the tape)

**Addendum #1:**
After some research, it seems that unlike D-9341, SCP-6916 cannot go back in time after death thus making SCP-6916 much bigger threat.</textarea></pre>
