A bad pulp fiction writer? - Scribe Lanius[[/footnote]][[footnote]]If you must know, this name was suggested to us by L.S. themselves. Please keep that tongue of yours in check, Lanius. - Archivist Hexa[[/footnote]][[/size]]

**Conspectus**

Our group has a certain reputation of sorts, you can say[[footnote]]Who exactly says this, we couldn&#39;t tell you. - Scribe Lanius[[/footnote]]. That of wanting all walks of life, whether mundane or not, to be free. Free to live out their lives without the Jailor&#39;s shackles and cages for the sake of &#34;normalcy.&#34; Free to be themselves. Free to just...exist. And usually, people would be right to assume that of us.

However, there must always be some exceptions. Grabnok the Destroyer is one of those, and quite a monumental one. Because their presence would mean the death of all life as we know it.

**Knowledge**
[[/=]]

**Traits:** Because of the inherent effect that Grabnok the Destroyer possesses, it is impossible for us to accurately describe their visage. However, it can be surmised that they look similar, if not identical, to most other variants of Thomas Yaltz[[footnote]]//That&#39;s// their true name? I was expecting something a little more intimidating. - Scribe Lanius[[/footnote]]  that the Jailors across the World Tree have imprisoned within their walls.

Grabnok possesses a latent ability to disappear from its home universe and manifest in another, random universe in at least two week intervals[[footnote]]Read: They&#39;re like those people from //Sliders//, if they couldn&#39;t control their portal at all. - Scribe Lanius[[/footnote]]. Based on our encounters with previous versions of Mister Yaltz, Grabnok cannot control this ability. Unlike the effect that they are most known for, this is one they have possessed since birth.

Grabnok&#39;s very presence causes the instantaneous death of all beings who inhabit the same universe they are in[[footnote]]##red|[ERROR: Footnote could not be retrieved.]##[[/footnote]][[footnote]]What in the Twelve Hells? - Scribe Lanius[[/footnote]][[footnote]]An error of our multiversal computer network, I&#39;m sure. Best not to worry about it; it happens more frequently than we&#39;d like. - Archivist Hexa[[/footnote]]. This occurs regardless of the species, flesh or lack thereof, or complete sentience and sapience of these beings, down to a cellular and bacterial level. This effect ignores distance and dimensional barriers, and has resulted in no shortage of Libraries having become forever and permanently silent.[[footnote]]Goddesses, it seems like overkill, don&#39;t you think? - Scribe Lanius[[/footnote]]

**Nature:** Despite their name and devastating ability, Grabnok the Destroyer is not doing all of this out of malice.[[footnote]]Then //why call them a &#39;destroyer&#39;//? - Scribe Lanius[[/footnote]][[footnote]]Lanius, this is your second and final warning. Please drop the subject. - Archivist Hexa[[/footnote]] In fact, the few glimpses we were able to receive of them, thanks to assistance from crafts donated to us by The Tinkerers, Grabnok appears to be forlorn, dark circles around their eyes and what appear to be self-inflicted scars across their arms.[[footnote]]...Geez. - Scribe Lanius[[/footnote]]

However, just because its effects are something they don&#39;t want anything to do with, doesn&#39;t make them any less dangerous as a being. It is estimated that Grabnok the Destroyer has caused the total loss of life in at least 260 universes across Yggdrasil.

**History &amp; Associated Parties:** Grabnok the Destroyer was originally imprisoned by the Jailors of their universe, as is the unfortunate fate of the majority of Thomas Yaltz versions throughout the World Tree.[[footnote]]How much is this &#34;majority&#34;? - Scribe Lanius[[/footnote]][[footnote]]A little over 66.7%. - Archivist Hale[[/footnote]][[footnote]]What the fuck.  - Scribe Lanius[[/footnote]] From recovered information about them, their life under internment was uneventful, until they had Shifted into a world affected by [[[SCP-2935|The Reaper&#39;s Cave]]].

By the time they returned to their home world, whatever vector causes people who pass through The Reaper&#39;s Cave and &#34;become death&#34; in order to spread its effect had latched onto Grabnok, causing the death of their home universe in the blink of an eye.

It is not known how long it took Grabnok to connect the dots between the dead world they had Shifted into and the reality they are now in; nor how many universes they have doomed because of these two abilities that they cannot control. But it is believed that it has all had, at best, a severely deleterious and depressive effect on their mind.

**Approach:** If Grabnok ever appears in your universe, it is already too late for you and everyone else. The best you can do - any of us can do - is pray to whatever gods you adhere to that they do not show up[[footnote]]Why don&#39;t we, I don&#39;t know, just have one of the drones shoot him? - Scribe Lanius[[/footnote]][[footnote]]Because 1). We&#39;re pacifists. 2). the devices the Tinkerers gave to us were done so on the express condition that no weaponry was attached to them. 3). We can&#39;t predict where and when Grabnok will show up, so it would be tedious to even set it up. And 4). Who&#39;s to say that their effect won&#39;t persist with their corpse? - Archvist Hexa[[/footnote]].

**Other Detail:** It is not known if Grabnok the Destroyer has attempted to travel via the Ways. However, given the continued existence of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/gardeners-of-the-orchard|The Gardeners]]][[footnote]]The what? - Scribe Lanius[[/footnote]][[footnote]]Don&#39;t worry about it. - Archivist Hexa[[/footnote]][[footnote]]//That just makes me worry even more, you know!// - Scribe Lanius[[/footnote]], either they have not done so, or the Gardeners are immune to the vector. It is a minuscule comfort either way.

**Observations &amp; Stories**

&#34;//Grabnok the Destroyer...such a silly name, for someone who&#39;s unwantingly caused omnicide to so many worlds[[footnote]]See, even this guy is saying it! - Scribe Lanius[[/footnote]][[footnote]]##red|[ERROR: Footnote could not be retrieved.]##[[/footnote]][[footnote]]...Archivist Hexa?[[/footnote]]//...

&#34;//I&#39;ve been fortunate enough to never have stumbled upon the worlds that have fallen to &#39;Grabnok&#39; and the biohazardous effect that&#39;s befallen them[[footnote]]@Maintainer Technus, I think Archivist Hexa&#39;s connection is having issues. Can you please look into this? - Scribe Lanius[[/footnote]][[footnote]]##red|[ERROR: message not sent; if connection issues persist, please contact L.S.]##[[/footnote]]. I count myself lucky every day, all the while fearing that at some time, within the infinite branches of our World Tree, my luck might soon run out[[footnote]]What in the Hells?[[/footnote]]//.

&#34;//The truth is, however, that I&#39;m not afraid of them, not specifically[[footnote]]@L.S. URGENT: The multiversal servers have lost their connection. I&#39;ve tried reaching Archivist Hexa and Maintainer Technus, but they have not responded. Please advise.[[/footnote]][[footnote]]##red|[ERROR: message not sent; if connection issues persist, please contact L.S.]##[[/footnote]][[footnote]]...Oh Goddesses no[[/footnote]]. In fact, I pity them, for a fate that was forcefully put upon them. I am afraid, however, that I, too, could end up in a world ravaged by the Reaper&#39;s Cave, and end up just like them.//&#34;
