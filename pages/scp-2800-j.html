[[/=]]
The Foundation //CORKSCREW Satellite Array// has been established in geosynchronous orbit to continuously monitor SCP-2800-J. Contact with the CORKSCREW Array is to be maintained from Site-21, and any major gravitational or seismic changes detected by the Array are to be reported to Site Command immediately. Upon suspicion of a possible //Melchizedek Event//, Sabre-Team is to be contacted directly for execution of Protocol 5-28-Sabrage.

Sabre-Team is to consist of three Overseer Personnel,[[footnote]] With the exception of O5-1. [[/footnote]] in four rotating shifts lasting no more than six months. With Shift 1 consisting of O5-2, -3, and -4, and rotating up to Shift 4, consisting of O5-11, -12, and -13. Upon conclusion of a shift, all Sabre-Team members are to reset and generate new passwords and keyphrases. These passwords are to then be printed out and delivered to the next Sabre Shift, who are to memorize and burn them. Upon conclusion of this process, the former team is to undergo Class-C amnestization.
 
Upon activation of Protocol 5-28-Sabrage, the designated Sabre-Overseers are to immediately report to Site-21 and unlock Chamber Alpha. Chamber Alpha can only be unlocked via password during a confirmed Melchizedek Event. As further precaution, each Sabre-Team member is to memorize only one-third of this password. Once unlocked, Sabre-Team is to utilize device //Pantabeta// and //2800-J-Delta// in conjunction to execute the next stage of Protocol 5-28-Sabrage. 

Upon confirmation that tectonic events have ceased worldwide, the Pantabeta and 2800-J-Delta devices are to be disassembled and re-sealed inside Chamber Alpha. SCP-2800-J will sleep for an average of 7-10 years before another Melchizedek Event.

Protocol 5-28-Sabrage is currently the only attainable way to prevent a full Melchizedek Event. Any failure in the execution of this procedure is certain to cause an XK-Class &#34;End of the World&#34; scenario.

&gt; I don&#39;t need to remind you how pivotal this role is to the stability of the world as we know it. Lucky for you, it is one we do not have to shoulder alone. From the Children of the Night, who first corked the Beast in the desert, to the human generations who kept watch after, and finally to us. This is more than a procedure, but a duty passed through the eons to each and every one of you, and I have no doubt in your ability to do what must be done. Remember those words each time you pass along that weight to your peers. You are the best of the best.

//(Site Director Kind, Commander Miles, O5-5, O5-6, and O5-7 arrive at the towering steel door in front of Chamber Alpha. The dark room is lit up by several sets of red emergency lights.)//

**O5-7:** Commander Miles, have your men outside. Nobody save us enters or leaves this room.

**Commander Miles:** //(Saluting.)// Yes, ma&#39;am!

//(Commander Miles leaves. O5-5 boots up the access computer.)//

**Director Kind:** I never really thought I&#39;d see the day...

**O5-6:** Spare us your personal comments, Director. They are irrelevant.

**Director Kind:** Yes sir. My apologies.

**O5-5:** We have prepared almost a decade for this day. There will be //no// distractions.

**Director Kind:** Understood, sir.

**Access Computer:** {{Authorized Access detected. Welcome Sabre-Shift Two.}}

**O5-5:** Activate 5-28-Sabrage access.

**Access Computer:** {{Card Read confirmed. Retinal Scan confirmed. Please enter verbal password codes //7, 6, 5//.}}

**O5-7:** Tree-Ait-Foxtrot.

**Access Computer:** {{Code 7 Confirmed...}}

**O5-6:** Juliet-Whisky-Niner.

//(O5-5 frowns and glances at him.)//

**Access Computer:** {{Incorrect Match.}}

//(Silence.)//

**O5-6:** Juliet-Whisky-Niner?

**O5-5:** Hold on...

**Access Computer:** {{Incorrect Match.}}

//(Silence.)//

**O5-7:** Six?

**O5-5:** That is my set.

**O5-6:** Excuse me?

**O5-5:** My part of the passcode? Juliet-Whisky-Niner?

**Access Computer:** {{Code 5 Confirmed...}}

**O5-5:** See? That one was mine. What&#39;s your part?

**O5-6:** That was it. I memorized //&#39;Juliet-Whisky-Niner&#39;//.

**Access Computer:** {{Incorrect password.}}

//(Silence.)//

**O5-7:** This is not the time for a joke-

**O5-6:** //(Interrupting.)// That is the code I received. That is what I memorized.

//(Silence.)//

**O5-7:** Six. //Tell me// you did not memorize the incorrect part of the password.

**O5-6:** That&#39;s the section I read and memorized and burned. //&#39;Juliet-Whisky-Niner&#39;//.

**Access Computer:** {{Incorrect password}}

**Director Kind:** Um, do you want me to-

**O5-7:** //(To Kind.)// Be quiet.

//(Director Kind reluctantly steps over to the computer, cancelling the password input.)//

**O5-5:** We all received our parts of the code at the beginning of our shift.

**O5-6:** Yes, I received and memorized part of the code.

**O5-7:** You did? Because that door is not open!

**O5-5:** Okay, let us-

**O5-6:** //(Interrupting.)// I received and memorized a code-

**O5-7:** The //wrong// code!

**O5-6:** Are you accusing me!?

**O5-5:** //Let&#39;s calm down!// Let&#39;s calm down before we let our emotions get the better of us.

**O5-7:** Right... of course.

**O5-5:** We can figure this out.

**O5-6:** Right, yes.

**O5-5:** Six, you&#39;re absolutely sure the part of the code you received was identical to mine?

**O5-6:** Yes.

**O5-5:** You didn&#39;t memorize any other code?

**O5-6:** Yes.

**O5-5:** Yes you did? Or did-

**O5-6:** Only one I got! Only one! //&#39;Juliet-Whisky-Fuckin-Niner&#39;//.

**O5-7:** Alright, calm down.

**Director Kind:** If you need help, I can call-

**O5-6:** Shut up!

**O5-7:** Quiet, Zulu!

**O5-6:** What kind of Overseer calls for help?

**O5-7:** What kind of Overseer can&#39;t memorize three digits!?

**O5-6:** So now you&#39;re insulting me?

**O5-7:** I&#39;m not insulting you-

**O5-6:** Yes you are-

**O5-7:** I&#39;m-

//(O5-5 puts his fingers in his mouth and whistles loudly.)//

**O5-7:** Ah!

**O5-6:** What!?

//(Silence.)//

**O5-5:** Let&#39;s see if we can reset the password.

**O5-6:** What do you mean? Like a facebook account?

**O5-7:** Excuse me?

**O5-6:** Right, you&#39;re a million years old, slipped my mind-

//(The ground suddenly shakes as a 3.2 magnitude earthquake hits the region, then stops.)//

//(Silence.)//

**O5-5:** Let&#39;s get on it, shall we?

**O5-7:** Yes.

//(O5-5 goes to the computer.)//

**O5-5:** Computer. Reset password.

**Access Computer:** {{Confirm Password Reset?}}

**O5-5:** Yes.

**Access Computer:** {{Warning. Unscheduled Password Reset outside of Shift Change. Unauthorized use of this feature may...}}

**Access Computer:** {{...result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. Password reset can only be done once per shift, and cannot be done again until the end of the following shift. Current user bears all responsibility for violation of protocol during these events, including any property damage, personnel casualties, civilian casualties...}}

//(Director Kind leans against the wall, drumming his fingers. O5-7 sighs.)//

**Access Computer:** {{...subject casualties, and usage of Foundation resources in cleanup operations and escaped anomalous subjects. Do you agree to these terms?}}

**O5-5:** Yes.

**Access Computer:** {{Verbal agreement of all Sabre-Team members required.}}

**O5-5:** Yes!

**O5-7:** Yes.

**O5-6:** Yes.

**Access Computer:** {{Confirmed... Password Reset engaged...}}

//(O5-5 sighs in relief.)//

**Access Computer:** {{Please enter your current password to begin.}}

**O5-5:** //(Groans.)//

**O5-6:** //Come on!//

**Director Kind:** Are there any procedures for a situation like this?

**O5-6:** //(Sighs.)// No, Kind. Believe it or not, one of us fucking up is a little //unprecedented//.

//(O5-7 crosses her arms.)//

**O5-7:** Maybe for you.

**O5-6:** You&#39;re blaming me?

//(O5-7 squints and shrugs.)//

**O5-6:** I memorized exactly what Three handed to me right before he shot a memory bullet into-

**Director Kind:** That&#39;s a good idea!

//(The Overseers look at him. Silence.)//

**Director Kind:** We... call Three?

//(Silence.)//

**Director Kind:** See if he remembers anything?

**O5-7:** Excuse me, who is in charge here?

**Director Kind:** Um... you?... Ma&#39;am.

**O5-7:** Yes. There is a reason we are in the position we&#39;re in. Because we&#39;re trusted to make the big decisions and make them //right//.

//(O5-5 nods, looking to Director Kind, then back to her. He leans close to her ear.)//

**O5-5:** //(Whispering.) I think we should call Three.//

//(Her eyes drift to O5-6. He stands awkwardly, giving a slight nod. She sighs.)//

**O5-7:** I suppose that&#39;s a vote.

//(She takes out her Mobile Overseer Communications Device. Tapping on the screen.)//

//(Silence.)//

**O5-7:** How do I connect to the network here?

**O5-5:** //(Sighs.)//

**O5-6:** Let me have a look.

**O5-7:** Just tell me how.

**O5-6:** We don&#39;t have time for this.

**O5-7:** Alright, fine. You&#39;re the genius here, after all.

//(She smiles and gives an aggressive nod as she hands him her device.)//

**O5-6:** //(Gritting his teeth.)// Thank you.

//(O5-6 looks through her device, going to the &#39;networks&#39; section of its settings.)//

**O5-6:** Kind.

**Director Kind:** //(Moving off the wall.)// Yes, sir?

**O5-6:** Internet password?

**O5-7:** Don&#39;t you mix up this one, now.

//(O5-6 glares at her.)//

**Director Kind:** It&#39;s, um...

//(O5-6 stares at him.)//

**Director Kind:** //(Sighs.)// &#39;Sussus-amongus-hashtag-420&#39;. Uppercase &#34;S&#34;, all one word... it was the uh... the tech guy&#39;s idea.

//(O5-6, puts the password in. O5-5 looks at Director Kind, slowly shaking his head.)//

**O5-7:** //&#39;Sussus Amongus&#39;//? What does that mean?

**O5-5:** I&#39;m //not// having that conversation again. The [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5761 space station incident] was enough of a nightmare.

//(O5-6 nods at him in agreement. He continues looking through the device for O5-3&#39;s contact.)//

//(Silence. Director Kind stands near with his hands in his pockets, bumping his back against the wall.)//

**Director Kind:** So... guess you guys have a lot of contact-

**O5-7:** Director, under no circumstances attempt small talk with us again.

**Director Kind:** //(Mouthing.) Okay then...//

//(O5-6 finds O5-3&#39;s contact on the device and calls him.)//

**O5-5:** Put him on speaker.

**O5-6:** Like I need you to tell me that.

**O5-5:** I&#39;m just contributing to our job.

**O5-6:** Yeah? Well I&#39;m just-

//(O5-3 answers the call.)//

**Phone (O5-3):** //&#34;Does the Black Mo-&#34;//

**O5-7:** &#34;Only at twilight.&#34;

**Phone (O5-3):** //You&#39;re supposed to wait for-//

**O5-6:** We don&#39;t have time, Three! It&#39;s us!

**Phone (O5-3):** //Sabre?//

**O5-5:** Yes, Three.

**Phone (O5-3):** //You&#39;re supposed to be... have you opened Alpha?//

//(Silence.)//

**O5-7:** We&#39;ve run into a hurdle. 

**Phone (O5-3):** //A hurdle? I&#39;m in a bunker right now! Half of Moscow just got pulverized-//

**O5-6:** We don&#39;t need the details. 

**Phone (O5-3):** //Well what are you doing!?//

**O5-6:** So, we mixed up-

**O5-7:** //You// mixed up.

**O5-6:** Fine, I did. Three, do you remember the part of the password you handed to me?

//(Silence.)//

**Phone (O5-3):** //Is that a serious question?//

//(Silence.)//

**Phone (O5-3):** //I took a Class-C after my shift. You know that!//

**Phone (Faint Voice):** //Who&#39;s there?//

**Phone (O5-3):** //Sabre-Team.//

**Phone (Faint Voice):** //Why are they calling?//

**O5-7:** Three, who&#39;s in there with you?

**Phone (O5-3):** //Four, Eight, Ten, and Eleven. This was the closest shelter when the Melchizedek started.//

//(O5-5 groans. O5-7 wipes her face.)//

**Phone (O5-8):** //You got your password wrong?//

**O5-6:** //(Sighs.)// Three handed me a paper, I memorized it and burned it. Same stupid thing we do every shift change! Looks like I got the wrong one, whoopsie-me! Can everyone shut up about it!?

**Phone (O5-8):** //Six, you need to calm down. Your conduct is growing unprofessional-//

**O5-6:** What I //need// is to get this goddamn door open!

**Commander Miles:** Three?

**O5-6:** Okay! Everybody shut up!

**O5-6:** Three, you have an emergency mnestic on you, right?

**Phone (O5-3):** //Yes I do... wait, that&#39;s a violation of protocol-//

**Phone (O5-10):** //An 8.6 just hit the Mid-Atlantic! The east coast is on Tsunami watch!//

**O5-7:** We need you to remember what happened, Three!

**Phone (O5-4):** //We should call One.//

**O5-6:** Do //not// call One!

**Phone (O5-3):** //I&#39;m taking the mnestic! But I want on record that I was opposed to this.//

//(Shuffling sounds over the phone as O5-3 retrieves his mnestic.)//

**Commander Miles:** You can&#39;t just bust it open?

//(Everyone in the room turns to look at him. Silence.)//

**O5-7:** And how, precisely, do you expect to do that?

**Commander Miles:** //(Shrugs.)// I could make a hole in it and go from there.

**Phone (O5-8):** //What is he talking about?//

**Commander Miles:** Shouldn&#39;t be too hard to do.

//(Commander Miles lifts up his assault rifle.)//

**O5-5:** Wait, what?

**Director Kind:** //Jesus!//

**O5-7:** //Miles! Stop!//

**Phone (O5-4):** //Sabre! What&#39;s happening!//

//(The ricochets stop. One bullet hits Director Kind in the thigh, he stumbles to the ground.)//

**Director Kind:** //Fuck!//

**Phone (O5-4):** //I&#39;m calling One.//

**O5-6:** //None of you call One!//

**O5-7:** All of you, be quiet! And don&#39;t move! Miles, give me that!

//(She grabs the rifle from Commander Miles.)//

**O5-7:** //(Nodding to Director Kind.)// Go get him a medkit.

**Commander Miles:** Yes- yes ma&#39;am.

//(Commander Miles leaves. Director Kind has taken off his jacket, and grunts as he wraps it around his injured leg.)//

**O5-7:** Alright then. I suppose we put this to a vote. Do we call One and ask him for help?

**Phone (O5-3):** //Because it wouldn&#39;t print without cyan! When I finally got it to start again it printed out another paper. I put the three papers with the codes into the envelopes and sent them to you.//

**O5-5:** There&#39;s an &#39;X&#39; in the corner.

//(O5-7 tries to click the &#39;X&#39; button, though its small size makes it difficult. She finally closes it.)//

**O5-5:** Now click the &#39;login&#39; button at the top.

**O5-7:** I see it.

//(O5-7 goes to click the login button, but instead clicks a banner advertisement just as it appears.)//

**O5-7:** Woah! What happened? What&#39;s it doing now?

**Computer:** {{Congratulations! You are our 1,000,000th visitor! Click now to claim your cash prize!}}

**O5-7:** What is this? How do I go back!?

**Phone:** //(More muffled laughter can be heard.)//

**O5-6:** //This// is the internet!? How do people use this fucking thing every day-

//(An 8.1 magnitude earthquake hits the region. Loud crashing noises are heard outside as the Overseers stumble about. A deep and booming voice can be heard chanting far below.)//

**Voice:** //(Speaking in a form of Proto-Daevite.) Cycle... [positive/yes]... again...//

**Computer:** {{Time is running out! Enter your credit card number to redeem your cash prize!}}

**O5-5:** Go back!

**O5-7:** How!?

**O5-5:** Oh my //god!// Get out of the fucking way!

//(O5-5 stumbles forward and pushes O5-7 away from the keyboard. He shoves his phone into O5-6&#39;s hand and grabs hold of the computer as the shaking slows and stope.)//

**O5-5:** I don&#39;t want to hear another word out of either of you! Not //you!// Not //you!// Not...

//(He looks down to Director Kind. Who is lying on the ground, unresponsive.)//

**O5-5:** //(Taking a deep breath.)// Login. Open the email. And click the link. A simple three-step process. Watch and learn.

//(O5-5 presses the &#39;back&#39; button, taking him back to the news site. He attempts to click the login button but is stopped when the email signup box appears. He closes it, and goes to the login button again, on the way closing another side popup asking for donations. He moves the mouse over the login button. A banner advertisement for an AI Girlfriend appears. He waits through a five-second timer, then closes it, making sure to carefully hit the center of the &#39;X&#39; button. Successfully clicking the login button, he is prompted to enter his credentials. He enters his Foundation credentials and presses the &#39;enter&#39; key. After another minute of clicking images with motorcycles and solving small puzzles he is let into his Foundation email.)//

**O5-6:** //&#39;A simple three-step process.&#39;//

**O5-5:** //(Sighs.)// Cheers, internet, may I never have to use you again.

**O5-7:** Cheers to that.

//(O5-5 opens his email page. He scrolls through several alarmed messages from other O5 members dated to the last half hour.)//

**O5-6:** Where is it?

**O5-7:** It should be from tech support, right?

**O5-5:** //Amjad?//

//(Sounds of muttering and shuffling are heard over the phone.)//

**Phone (Amjad):** //Yes sir, I am here.//

**O5-5:** Now that you and your friends have had your laugh at us, do me the pleasure of taking us off speaker and tell me where my password reset email is.

**Phone (Amjad):** //(Chuckling.) Have you checked your junk folder?//

//(O5-5 grabs the phone.)//

**O5-5:** //Quit fucking with me!// You&#39;ve had your fun, listening to us flop around like imbeciles while millions around the world pay with their lives! The funny time is over, and when we get this thing contained the first thing I&#39;m going to do is send Alpha-1 to rip you from your little cubicles and force Class-C&#39;s down your throat until every second of today&#39;s events is thoroughly expunged from living memory! But that&#39;s //only// if you give me my email in the next sixty seconds! Otherwise you&#39;ll be looking at all that and an orange jumpsuit right before I feed you and your family to our eternal lizard as a treat! //Where. Is. My. Email!?//

**Phone (Amjad):** //Can you check your junk folder please, sir?//

//(Silence.)//

//(O5-5 clicks on his email&#39;s junk folder. He scrolls over a long list of unopened Ethics Committee messages and reaches the end. The most recent message is from Tech Support.)//

//(Silence. O5-5 lets out a long sigh.)//

**Phone (Amjad):** //Have I answered your questions in a timely and satisfactory manner?//

//(O5-5 looks to O5-6, then to O5-7.)//

**O5-5:** Yes, Amjad. You have.

**Phone (Amjad):** //I am very glad to hear that. Thank you, O5-5, for calling Foundation Tech Support and if you are ever in need of assistance in preventing another apocalypse in the future please do not be afraid to call us again. Right everybody?//

**Phone:** //(Sounds of laughter and affirmation erupt from a multitude of different voices in the background.)//

//(O5-5 disconnects the call, tossing the phone over his shoulder. He takes a deep breath. The ground begins to shake again.)//

**O5-5:** Drinks on me tonight.

**O5-6:** Stir some Class-A into mine.

//(O5-5 opens the email, and clicks the download button. A window appears prompting him to run the password reset program. He enters his Overseer identification information and runs the program. The ground shakes more violently.)//

**O5-5:** What should our new password be?

**O5-7:** A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I

**O5-5:** Sure, why not.

//(O5-5 enters the new password into the box. Cracks appear in the ceiling as small pieces of concrete fall to the floor. The Site comes under immense structural stress. A SCP-2800-J hatching event is imminent.)//

**O5-7:** Is everything ready?

**O5-5:** Yes. Let&#39;s reset this password and save the world.

//(O5-5 moves his mouse over the &#39;Reset Password&#39; button. The screen suddenly changes, casting a bright blue light into the crumbling room.)//

**O5-6:** //Oh fuck me.//

//(Recording ends as the facility&#39;s power system goes offline. Complete structural failure occurs minutes later.)//

&gt; The following image was recovered by Project Lazarus personnel in the ruins of Site-21&#39;s data center while investigating the cause of the recent XK-Class Event. It is believed to be a routine screenshot of Chamber Alpha&#39;s Access Computer seconds before the awakening of SCP-2800-J and subsequent XK-Class End-of-the-World Scenario.
