**SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** As of 2029, SCP-7171 has reached its perihelion. However, due to the current state of technology and the massive distance there is between SCP-7171 and Earth, containment is currently deemed implausible. Otherwise, the anomaly is to be kept under constant surveillance by Jupiter-stationed Foundation probes to determine whether the most plausible contingency plan should be activated or not.

**SPECIFIC CONTINGENCY PROTOCOLS:** The &#34;containment&#34; of SCP-7171 is to be centered around the dissemination of misinformation to the public, no matter the current status of modern society. The SCP Foundation is to be represented as a non-governmental organization dedicated to the protection of humanity and the survival of human civilization. A plausible excuse or cover story is to be developed and scattered across the remnants of society to hide the true nature of SCP-7171-α.

Should any personnel enter a state of panic because of the impending XK-Class (&#34;End of the World&#34;) Scenario, they are to be detained and sedated. Patience is to be kept until a solution to SCP-7171-α is found.

Further containment procedures are currently being drafted and decided by the O5 Council and the Foundation&#39;s higher administration. Dr. Maurice Arkand has been promoted as the Department of Para-Astronomy&#39;s head, and all suggestions and complaints regarding SCP-7171 are to be redirected to him for the time being.

----

**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-7171 is the designation given to a Class-XI tychekinetic Trans-Neptunian Object (TNO), currently located 25 AU away from the Sun. Prior to SCP-7171-α, SCP-7171 took the form of a contact binary[[footnote]]Contact binaries are singular celestial bodies composed of the conjunction between 2 bodies.[[/footnote]]comprised of 2 diminutive asteroids, both estimating an approximate length of 5 km in diameter each.

SCP-7171 was, until SCP-7171-α occurred, the originator of the Solar System&#39;s baseline, local probability. However, following SCP-7171-α, SCP-7171&#39;s primary properties were heavily affected, thus altering local probability on a gargantuan scale. In other words, things that were deemed very unlikely or almost impossible to happen were now given a higher chance of occurring depending on how damaged SCP-7171 was.

SCP-7171-α refers to an event caused by the sudden impact of SCP-7171 with an indeterminate object, presumed to be an asteroid of similar diameter. The exact details of SCP-7171-α&#39;s origin are unknown, but it is known that:

* SCP-7171-α&#39;s occurrence is extremely detrimental to SCP-7171 and its properties, as it is now vulnerable to other objects within the Kuiper Belt.
* SCP-7171-α occurred spontaneously and by chance.
* SCP-7171-α&#39;s occurrence resulted in SCP-7171 being heavily damaged, as one of its 2 sections is now cracked and a small crater has been formed in it. This was captured by one of Project FORTUNA-ASTREA&#39;s probes prior to deactivation.

As SCP-7171 resulted in baseline probability being heavily altered, the chances of natural catastrophes occurring are now higher. See Addendum 1 for more information.

**AUDIO LOG:** 11/06/2029

On the late morning of 07/06/2029, following the discovery of SCP-7171 on Neptune&#39;s orbit by a modified //Hestia// probe, all contact with it was lost and a global power outage occurred for 40 seconds. The following is a phone call conducted by Dr. Maurice Arkand while analyzing images of SCP-7171.

**Dr. Arkand:** What are you doing in there?

**Dr. Dawson:** Night shift. The Site Director&#39;s been escorted to a safe bunker. Nobody knows why, but it&#39;s probably because of the explosion.

**Dr. Arkand:** Shit. I&#39;ll tell you back in the observatory. This isn&#39;t good.

**Dr. Dawson:** Maurice, what is going on in there?

**Dr. Arkand:** We&#39;ve found the epicenter of the SCP-7171 phenomenon. We&#39;ve lost all contact with the probe. It stopped sending signals and photos.

**ADDENDUM 7171.1:** Timeline Log.

Following the events of SCP-7171-α, orbital and behavioural alterations have been registered across the Sol System. Below is a concise list of SCP-7171&#39;s perceived effects as of 7 days after SCP-7171-α.

* Objects in the Kuiper Belt and its proximities have suffered significant modifications in their orbits, causing many asteroids to gain acceleration and abandon the Kuiper Belt. Said asteroids are expected to traverse both in and outside the Sol System, judging by their current situation. SCP-7000&#39;s integrity is at high risk and other bodies in the Sol System could be affected by similar effects in the nearby future.

* The number of solar flares observed on Sol&#39;s surface have increased by 200%. This poses a risk of a geomagnetic storm in the near future if this behaviour is to continue. This geomagnetic storm could potentially damage electrical equipment on Earth, putting several Foundation Sites at risk of containment breaches.

* The height of tidal waves has increased by an average of 2 meters. While not confirmed, this may be due to SCP-7171 direct effects on Luna. A short study conducted by AIC Binary Star suggests that the orbit of the Earth&#39;s moon has reduced its radius and will most likely continue to do so in the future. A collision with Earth could happen in a time span of 15 years.

Because of this, the Department of Para-Astronomy has officially recognized the threat that SCP-7171 now poses to the Foundation and humanity as a whole. The results of SCP-7171&#39;s effects could lead to both a potential IK-Class (&#34;Collapse Of Global Civilization&#34;) Scenario, and a devastating PK-Class (&#34;Probability Restructuring&#34;) Scenario. Site-47&#39;s main focus is now set on the containment of SCP-7171 and damage control.

The following is a timeline of several events that have occurred globally because of SCP-7171.

**UPDATE 1/08/2029:** Two months after SCP-7171-α, the previously detailed effects have continued to occur and increased significantly in intensity. Human society as a whole has observed and experienced the effects of SCP-7171. While the Veil has been maintained, humanity as a whole has already acknowledged the situation and several countries are in a permanent state of alarm. All Foundation Sites have ceased their primary research functions regarding low-priority anomalies.

----

**UPDATE 7/08/2029:** An unprecedented earthquake of magnitude 7.3 occurred in South Carolina, demolishing Site-19. Several containment breaches occurred, however, a new set of safety protocols prevented many personnel casualties.

----

**UPDATE 12/08/2029:** Abnormal weather conditions have been observed in Europe and Western Asia. This has resulted in a major decrease in food production. The use of self-replicating food anomalies has been considered to reduce the effects of famine caused by current events. Approval pending.

----

**UPDATE 17/08/2029:** On this day, a meteorite impacted Site-47&#39;s South Building[[footnote]]This building was the Department of Anomalous Manufacturing&#39;s base of operations.[[/footnote]]. Despite measuring approximately 300 meters prior to entering Earth&#39;s atmosphere, the meteorite lost only 16% of its original mass as opposed to the average 95% in all other cases. The meteorite that landed on Site-47 was noted to be 9 meters long. The other half of the meteorite, which landed in Kansas, United States, was reported to have a length of 16 meters upon impact.

The following transcript was attached to the log.

**Dr. Arkand:** Not good, for sure. Everyone is losing their cool. This incident, summed up with the multiple containment breaches occurring at other sites is really putting everyone crazy. They can&#39;t go back home, they can&#39;t see their families... On top of that, a lot of people are being moved to a new position to help with densely populated cities, and SCP-7171.

**Dr. Dawson:** Has the O5 Council said anything?

**Dr. Arkand:** No, the last time we heard anything of them was over a week ago. I&#39;ve been trying to catch their attention with the whole building incident but they are so adamant about not reading my messages.

**Dr. Dawson:** Maybe something happened to them, who knows?

(//Agent Lindberg looks at Dr. Dawson from the vehicle&#39;s rear-view mirror.//)

**Agt. Lindberg:** The Council? (//Chuckles.//) They have the best protection on the entire planet, they&#39;ll be the last ones to go down, if not you or me.

**Dr. Dawson:** Fair enough. I mean, at least Site-47 and the Para-Astronomy Department have a ton more funds now, right?

(//Agent Lindberg shakes her head before focusing on the road again.//)

**Agt. Lindberg:** Yes, it really does. Have you seen the department foreman&#39;s new car, sweetheart?

(//Lindberg laughs.//)

**Agent Lindberg:** Here&#39;s the deal. The O5s are putting themselves on the front lines and leaving us in the dark as if they were some kind of heroes. They don&#39;t really care about where the funding goes as long as it &#34;comes here&#34;. I&#39;m honestly surprised they&#39;ve never done this before.

**Dr. Arkand:** Haven&#39;t they, though?

**Agt. Lindberg:** Heh, you got me there.

**Dr. Arkand:** Anyway, Maya. Were you able to salvage anything from the destroyed building?

**Dr. Dawson:** I did recover my schematics and tools but all of the heavy equipment has been destroyed, I doubt we can use any of it. The //Hestia// blueprints are trashed. Ripped apart, made into pieces. I&#39;ve heard the comms system has been recently transferred though.

**Dr. Arkand** Fair enough. So... Any ideas? How are we meant to fix this?

(//Dr. Dawson pats Dr. Arkand&#39;s shoulder and smiles slightly.//)

**Dr. Dawson:** We&#39;ll figure something out. Of course, if the O5s stop trying to score good solutions.

(//Silence.//)

**Dr. Arkand:** You&#39;re right.

(//Dr. Arkand sighs.//)

**Dr. Dawson:** Hey, uh... Do you remember when we started the project?

**Dr. Arkand:** I do. Why?

(//Dr. Dawson smiles.//)

**Dr. Dawson:** You remember the party after the project was approved? The whole department was there, even Albert. Well, that&#39;s probably one of the most fun moments I&#39;ve had in years, if not the most.

**Dr. Arkand:** Well, it sure was a good party.

**Dr. Dawson:** My point is that you&#39;re more than just a worker, Maurice. You and Lacroix are my closest friends. Probably the best. We&#39;ve been there for each other in our highs and we will remain together for our lows, right?

**Dr. Arkand:** I- ...Nevermind. You&#39;re right. I guess we will.

**Agt. Lindberg:** Nice chit-chat you got going on there, but what about me? (//Smiles.//)

(//Dr. Dawson giggles.//)

SCP-7171 poses a Tiamat-Class threat to the Foundation&#39;s mission and the survival of humanity. However, under the current circumstances, the Veil will remain. The Foundation will not refrain from providing humanitarian help, using any conventional means such as cover stories, amnestization, and other methodologies. The O5 Council will oversee any projects regarding SCP-7171 and will discuss the matter of funding its containment.

The aforementioned discussion has been recorded in the form of a log fragment:

(//The following is a fragment of the meeting transcript. The O5 Council has been discussing for over 5 hours non-stop, excluding other additional meetings regarding the Foundation&#39;s administration.//)

**O5-4:** ...act. The situation is getting out of hand and there might be no turning back if we wait for too long.

**O5-6:** I&#39;ve already stated my thoughts. I think we should just neutralize it.

**O5-9:** Pretty much. It&#39;s bound to neutralize itself anyway. Maybe we should start an evacuation project?

**O5-3:** Didn&#39;t we have one of these going on already?

**O5-1:** (//Sighing.//) Let&#39;s just...

**O5-5:** You all know all of this is happening because it is destroying itself, right?

**O5-12:** And what do we do then? Shoot other asteroids with a laser gun?

(//Silence.//)

**O5-3:** Maybe shooting lasers won&#39;t be successful. But we could send another probe.

**O5-2:** Oh, yes. Equip it with a drone. If we&#39;re lucky enough it might be able to fill 7171&#39;s cracks or clean it from any rubble. Maybe &#34;fix&#34; it?

**O5-8:** A probe would prove worthless against SCP-7171&#39;s effects. The closer it gets to it, the more the likelihood of it being destroyed increases exponentially. The chance of Nyx piercing through the surface of Hydra was extremely unlikely, but look at what happened. Unlikely things are now likely to happen because of this... This turgid thing.

**O5-7:** I agree with Eight. There is no guarantee that that will work, at all.

**O5-11:** I mean. Maybe, just maybe, its effects could be overpowered by sending enough drones and probes so that the possibilities of all of them failing are minimum to practically none. If it&#39;s just about trying enough times, then... Why- Why don&#39;t we try every single time at once?

**O5-4:** We&#39;re in the middle of a humanitarian crisis right now and the production cost of each of those probes is incredibly expensive. Considering our situation, this is way over our capabilities.

**O5-11:** Then we will have to use everything we&#39;ve got and redirect all of our funds to them.

**O5-9:** To what purpose? Just, for what? To waste our money on something that might not even work? This will cost lives, lots of lives.

**O5-6:** That is correct. It&#39;s obviously gonna cost us a ton of lives, of course. But, would you rather risk a ton of lives, or all of humanity?

(//The room falls into silence.//)

**O5-4:** Anything to add? No?

(//More silence.//)

**O5-4:** I think have come to a consensus. I appreciate your assistance, gentlemen.

**INTERVIEWER:** O5-4

**INTERVIEWEE:** Dr. Maurice Arkand

----

= **[BEGIN LOG]**

**O5-4:** Good evening, once again.

**Dr. Arkand:** Evening.

**O5-4:** How are you doing today? Better?

(//Silence.//)

**Dr. Arkand:** ... Better. Yes.

**O5-4:** I see. Back at where we left yesterday. I&#39;ve been reading the second revision of SCP-7171&#39;s file. Not bad, may I say. Dr. Arkand, do you have any idea as to what happened to the rest of your department&#39;s members?

**Dr. Arkand:** What is this kind of question?

**O5-4:** We&#39;ve sent something back to Earth to scan for people. If I recall from the file, the manufacturing building was destroyed right when a meteor fell on it, but not many people were affected, as far as I know. In fact, you said some of them were treated in the Medical Wing, right?

**Dr. Arkand:** Uh... Yeah. That&#39;s right. Also, did you just say //something?//

**O5-4:** Indeed.

**Dr. Arkand:** Are you talking about Binary Star?

**O5-4:** Yes, but that&#39;s not the case right now. What happened to your co-workers, Dr. Arkand?

**Dr. Arkand:** I don&#39;t know.

(//Silence.//)

**Dr. Arkand:** I wasn&#39;t even the department head.

**O5-4:** But you were a very popular and prominent member.

**Dr. Arkand:** Well yes, but I&#39;m not omnipresent. Most of them just... Vanished into thin air. I just stopped hearing of them. Some of them were confined within the main building but not even there things were going right. I can tell that because... Well, one of our engineers, Albert Lacroix, they were in there. But they would often escape the curfew to come to the observatory, with me. Maya also did the same.

**O5-4:** You should&#39;ve been confined as well.

**Dr. Arkand:** I //was// confined until you organized and passed that vote. Everybody was there, but then I spent the rest of my years in the Site&#39;s observatory when things began going pretty wrong. Mostly when you told me to.

**O5-4:** I see. I see. What about Dr. Lacroix?

**Dr. Arkand:** They were a very nice pal. They witnessed more things during Alpha than most of us did. They would&#39;ve told you many more things than I&#39;m telling you, but just because they knew more. They were always watching the probes. You know what happened to them? They grabbed a revolver out of their pocket and put it to their head. They escaped the Foundation and ran into the afterlife, much like Maya.

**O5-4:** Did they hold an important role within the project?

**Dr. Arkand:** They designed the probes.

**O5-4:** Then they must&#39;ve been a valued member, from what I see. I apologize for your loss, Maurice.

**Dr. Arkand:** Oh, it&#39;s okay. It was bound to happen.

**O5-4:** I&#39;ve also read the file. Much like in the other explorations, it seems as if something&#39;s missing. You attached these personal logs that occurred during Alpha but not what we need. You said it yesterday. It&#39;s a research project made to understand things, not to-

**Dr. Arkand:** Yes, I know. But you&#39;re here to ask me about the things I didn&#39;t add to the file, right? Not the ones I //did// add.

(//Silence.//)

**O5-4:** Alright, alright. I see.

**ADDENDUM 7171.2:** Exploration Log.

Following the orders of the O5 Council, Site-47&#39;s personnel and several other Foundation facilities have begun the development of a modified version of the Foundation Standard Landing Probe, equipped with several kilograms of rock and a drone capable of interacting with SCP-7171.

Additionally, Foundation AIC Binary Star has been linked with all of the probes for real-time assessment. Binary Star will remain operational even if the probes are damaged, as long as at least one of them remains stable. The probes were sent to Lunar Site-32 for subsequent refueling and storage.[[footnote]]While Luna had been damaged by the effects of SCP-7171, Lunar Site-32 remains completely operational.[[/footnote]]

The following is a video log detailing the launch of the drones:

**OBSERVATION:** The probe group nears Jupiter, and it is now at a distance of 2 AU from Saturn. Saturn has become a threat for multiple observed reasons:

* The gravitational pull has increased to approximately 28.2 m/s, surpassing that of Jupiter. The cause of this is unknown, but it is believed that a massive amount of asteroids and debris has been incorporated into its core.
* The rings have increased in diameter to about 340,000 km because of the incoming asteroids.
* Jupiter&#39;s rings are now piercing through the planet&#39;s surface to enter into contact with its core. The cause of this is unknown.

To avoid further complications and loss of material, the route towards SCP-7171 has been altered by Binary Star, expected to cause a delay of 8 months.

**Dr. Arkand:** But that&#39;s not what I meant. (//Coughs.//) My family is probably under a bunker, deep below the sea, or under a grave right now. Lacroix has...

(//Silence.//)

**Dr. Arkand:** Well, here we are. Alone. It&#39;s most likely that there&#39;s nobody left here to hear us. I&#39;ll be dead sooner or later. You could say I&#39;m one of the luckiest men in the world right now.

(//Binary Star remains silent for 5 seconds.//)

**BINARY STAR:** DO YOU CONSIDER ME AS YOUR FRIEND, ARKAND?

**Dr. Arkand** ... What?

**BINARY STAR:** ARE YOU ASKING ME TO REPEAT, COMMAND?

(//Short silence.//)

**BINARY STAR:** ALRIGHT. DO YOU CONSIDER ME AS YOUR FRIEND, ARKAND?

**OBSERVATION:** First contact with the now dissolved Kuiper Belt. Pluto can be seen in the distance, along with Eris. Eris is now retaking its orbit, as it has now completed its perihelion. However, the probes do not seem to be able to record it with clarity. Nothing unusual seems to affect Eris, regardless of its proximity to SCP-7171.

Pluto seems to be unaffected as well.

To avoid waste of fuel, the communications system has been deactivated temporarily.

Following this, the //Hestia// probe was suspected to have arrived at SCP-7171. Due to Dr. Arkand&#39;s disappearance, the SCP-7171 project has been transferred to Lunar Site-32&#39;s staff in order to continue and finish the task.

Site-47 has been decommissioned due to lack of personnel and inutility.
