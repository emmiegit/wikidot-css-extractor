Howdy, stranger. Um... they/them, from the North of England, born in 1998... think that&#39;s all the personal info. Thanks for visiting, hope you enjoy some of these articles!

__stuff__

As a quick note, anything marked with an * is something I&#39;d consider good enough to upvote were it someone else&#39;s article. You&#39;re welcome to read the rest, but I do think they&#39;re a step down.

[[[SCP-2994]]] - whiteboards made from dogs that teach you german (rewrite of a Jekeled article)

[[collapsible show=&#34;rambling&#34; hide=&#34;no more rambling&#34;]]

Not much to say. It&#39;s shit, don&#39;t read it, just hand-wringing about the new rewrite.

[[/collapsible]]

[[[SCP-2907]]] - interdimensional dead prehistoric fascist worm

[[collapsible show=&#34;more rambling&#34; hide=&#34;no more rambling&#34;]]

Bit better. Inspired by a hit-and-run coldpost about a box that killed you unless you were Spartan? Used sentient when it meant sapient, I (somewhat snarkily, unfortunately) used a worm as an example of sentience not sapience, then started imagining a Spartan worm, it turned into this.

I love weird, incomprehensible articles. You know the type, where it //feels// like there&#39;s some internal logic, but fuck if you know what it is. So I was pretty happy with the largely bewildered reception. My highest rated article, but that&#39;s down to age not quality; it&#39;s a fairly generic S3 article. Described as &#34;rote weirdness&#34; one time, which is fair, but it&#39;s adequate enough.

[[[SCP-5891]]]* - house filled with itself and also a guy is sad

[[collapsible show=&#34;chattering&#34; hide=&#34;no more chattering&#34;]]

After a //long// hiatus (six years between articles!), I came back, devoured as much of the new stuff as possible and cranked those rusty writing gears into motion. Being posted around the same time was the [[[How to Clean a Polyester Dress]]] series, and after I read it I genuinely sat back for a moment and said out loud &#34;well, how the fuck am I supposed to compete with this?&#34; It was tense, horrifying and //layered//. The main character is real enough to be almost sympathetic until the next horrible thing she does, and it has things to say! About TERFism, fascism, how the former can slip to the latter... And it suddenly hit me: I could actually, like, write about //things//. Themes, politics, stuff other than &#34;hey, wouldn&#39;t it be fucked up if X?&#34; And I wrote this.

It&#39;s, uh, not quite as good as that series.

Long, obscure, almost storyless, mostly atmosphere, probably a tad boring and the dialogue needs a going-over. But, my favourite article I&#39;ve written so far. It doesn&#39;t do what it&#39;s trying to do as well as I&#39;d like, but I really do like what it&#39;s trying to do. I&#39;d begun to value mood and atmosphere more than traditional narrative, and this is an experiment in that; it started with the first exploration log, which was written with no knowledge of the rest of the article other than the theme and a vague idea of the anomaly, and the backstory evolved from that and is barely alluded to. In fact, I&#39;ve no idea how much of anything is clear here. I don&#39;t mind that.

Oh, and I was marathoning Fringe when I named the characters, can you tell?

[[[SCP-5394]]]* - phones that gaslight you

[[collapsible show=&#34;prattling&#34; hide=&#34;no more prattling&#34;]]

My dad used to work at a call centre for a security company, and one time he got a call from an old lady convinced her son was isolating her, because she&#39;d had no calls and seen no-one but him since the start of lockdown. Turns out, she had her phone on silent. This really freaked me out.

Probably my best. Also, my lowest rated because uuuuuuuuuuugh. Still bemoan being too cowardly to post without the addendum, even if I quite like it; I strongly believe there should be space for simple &#34;things what do things&#34; on the site, but I worried it&#39;d get downvoted into oblivion if I didn&#39;t tack on a &#34;narrative.&#34;

[[[SCP-5459]]] - island of tory dickheads

[[collapsible show=&#34;gabbling&#34; hide=&#34;no more gabbling&#34;]]

Satire being unsubtle doesn&#39;t have to mean it&#39;s bad. This is, though. The point when I decided &#34;stop worrying about deletion, fucking post things,&#34; for better or for worse.

Started as a -J parodying all those &#34;how did this millennial buy this house? answer: their parents are fucking loaded!&#34; articles, but then I started to actually make myself angry, plus I realised the victims needed a say, and said say needed to be sincere. As cringy as it is, I think it&#39;s pretty funny, and I like the dialogue, but it&#39;s a bit &#34;Fisher Price&#39;s My First Satire.&#34;

[[/collapsible]]

[[[On Some Faraway Beach]]]* - [[[SCP-389 |woman]]] writes to penpal about trees and mythology, and is sad

[[collapsible show=&#34;jabbering&#34; hide=&#34;no more jabbering&#34;]]

Slice-of-life tale about an S1 article so obscure --it&#39;s rated below 100-- //well, I think it was when I started it// is one of the more niche things to write about, but I&#39;m very fond of this. It&#39;s the sort of thing you&#39;d find on Random Tale, an old orphaned story, and that&#39;s the sort of thing that inspired this.

Not really into worldbuilding, but I had fun here; Zhassizhassi&#39;s name was sort of an onomatopoeia on fire crackling, and as simple as the myth is I do like it. I still don&#39;t know how much her isolation comes through.

[[[SCP-6931]]] - sad ghost gets ready for work

[[collapsible show=&#34;babbling&#34; hide=&#34;no more babbling&#34;]]

Most of what I have to say about this is already on its discussion page. Coldpost and it shows, not in a technical sense but in a &#34;there was an obvious better way to do this but no-one had the chance to point it out&#34; sense. It&#39;s //shallow//, and I can&#39;t stand that. I will say I wanted to play on the whole &#34;ghost eternally relives a moment from its life&#34; thing, where the twist is he&#39;s actually doing it consciously because compulsion.

[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-how-do-people-pick-j-numbers-anyway-j |SCP-143-J]]] - two guys who won&#39;t shut the fuck up

[[collapsible show=&#34;blathering&#34; hide=&#34;no more blathering&#34;]]

Because 1. I write and abandon/flit about a fuckton of drafts simultaneously and 2. I have a core cast of characters I use, most of my characters have had three or four unpublished articles for me to get a good idea of them (Farnsworth is in three earlier articles, too). In this case, Farnsworth and Samuels were already rivals, the &#34;obligatory dickhead&#34; and &#34;obligatory comic relief,&#34; respectively, then I thought it&#39;d be funny to ship them, and lo. No idea why it did so well (look, it did well for one of my articles), there&#39;s no actual jokes; it&#39;s just snark and silliness. 5459 is funnier, I think.

[[/collapsible]]

[[[Pareidolia]]]* - woman sees a ghost/a bit of driftwood in old photo

[[collapsible show=&#34;waffling&#34; hide=&#34;no more waffling&#34;]]

Another &#34;why did this survive&#34; one; I only posted it to clear out my sandbox, which had ran out of space. This was actually the first full thing I did on coming back, given I was absent for Parawatch&#39;s development period but they&#39;re fucking great and I wanted to give it a go. Didn&#39;t think it was any good, though, so it stayed in the sandbox for nearly a full year, but apparently I should have just posted it. Rambling, and the themes/ambiguity is tacked on, but people seem to have liked it, so who am I to tell them they&#39;re wrong.

You know, actually, when I read this as its own thing, it&#39;s actually a solid enough Parawatch tale. Huh.

[[[SCP-6964]]] - cultists&#39; big day out, goes poorly

[[collapsible show=&#34;wittering&#34; hide=&#34;no more wittering&#34;]]

Probably the weakest of my vaguely competent articles. It&#39;s a pastiche of ghost ship stories like the //Mary Celeste// or the //Teigenmouth Electron// (if you get the chance, there&#39;s a fascinating but sad story behind that one), with a backstory of shady individuals, some inexplicable weirdness on board, and no real answer to the mystery. It then had a completely different article idea smashed into it, for which there are some major hints for.

There&#39;s no way to properly figure out what&#39;s going on here, which is... fine, I guess. That&#39;s part of the intrigue with ghost ships. Elekana&#39;s report is the only part that I think properly works, though; the rest is rushed and underdeveloped, and I really should have put more thought into the details. Might have another crack at it.

[[[SCP-6908]]] - sad woman does nothing. also there is a cult that does nothing

[[collapsible show=&#34;nattering&#34; hide=&#34;no more nattering&#34;]]

I don&#39;t pretend this is anything special, but I&#39;m proud of it for one main reason: my first two articles took several months and at least fifteen reviewers/helpers each to complete. This was conceptualised and written directly into the slot in about four and a half hours, and it&#39;s better than both (even if I&#39;m still not satisfied with the actual anomaly). I&#39;m quite chipper at having gone from paralysing fear of posting anything without a tonne of support to being happy to just write and post something entirely on a whim.

I&#39;m fascinated by the idea of people sitting around and waiting so long for their life to happen to them that it sort of passes them by before they realise. Grace has found themself stuck where they&#39;re just getting by, surviving, and they know what they want, but they&#39;re too frightened to actually try for it. Joining the cult was a way to make them feel like they were making progress without ever having to make concrete steps for it. As for what it is they want... I headcanon them as closeted trans, although up until the big rant I&#39;d considered it to be depression and suicidal ideation - not active, they don&#39;t actually //want// to die, they just sort of think about it and low-key expect it to happen. I suppose the two backstories aren&#39;t mutually exclusive, but it&#39;s left ambiguous anyway, so I guess it&#39;s moot.

Also, I find it kind of funny that the big moment of giving up was them //leaving// a cult, as we all know, a sad thing.
