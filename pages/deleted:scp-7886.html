**Item #:** SCP-7886

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**
All SCP-7886 locations are to be monitored thoroughly and constantly by at least five personnel at each location. All entrances to SCP-7886 facilities have been secluded and shut down, and no civilians or other personnel are to enter without proper clearance by an O5 Council Member.

SCP-7886-D is to be monitored constantly for any reports by medical facilities, police departments, or other civilian outlets for signs of SCP-7886-D symptoms and growth. Any individuals found to contain a growth are to be terminated and their bodies incinerated. 

Further probing efforts to locate SCP-7886 locations are to be operated following the discovery of a proper source.

**Description:**
SCP-7886 designates three subterranean testing facilities and a collection of relatively unknown anomalous formerly owned by A.C.I.A.S (SCP-7886-A, SCP-7886-B, and SCP-7886-C) and an unknown anomalous disease capable of infecting any solid object (SCP-7886-D). All instances are currently located contiguously on the United States mainland. Presumably, a greater number of SCP-7886 instances exist but have yet to be uncovered. 

SCP-7886-A nominates the Washington Monument, an obelisk-shaped building within the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Located east of the reflective pool and Lincoln Memorial. The monument&#39;s material consists of marble, granite, and blue stone gneiss. 

The subterranean facility is located 5,400m (5910 yards) underneath the monument&#39;s base. Currently, access is only available via a large freight elevator mostly constructed in the 1970s. The structure is buried under a large quantity of rubble reminiscent of bedrock and charcoal. The structure&#39;s depth renders it undetectable by the majority of current radar technology, preventing full analysis of its base and structure.  

SCP-7886-B designates the Lincoln Memorial, a structure constructed to honor the sixteenth (16) President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. Its position is situated on the western end of the National Mall, Washington, D.C. The building closely resembles a structure reminiscent of a neoclassical temple. The memorial consists of granite, limestone, and marble.

Currently, all known entrances into the SCP-7886-B testing facility are occluded. Presumably, the facility extends for a distance of at least 6,000m (6,560 yards) before making a sharp vertical drop of 1,000m (1,094 yards). Similarly to SCP-7886-A, all radar technology is ineffective and inconclusive rendering full analysis of its structure impossible.

SCP-7886-C designates the Mount Rushmore National Monument. It is located centrally on a colossal sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore. It is located in the Black Hills, near Keystone, South Dakota. The memorial park covers thousand two hundred and seventy-eight acres (1,278) and the definite mountain has an estimated five thousand seven hundred and twenty-five feet (5,725 ft / 1,745 m) above sea level. 

SCP-7886-C testing facility is established within Mount Rushmore. All known entrances appear permanently deactivated or disabled. Radar technology is currently capable of comprehensively viewing the integral structure of the facility. It presently conveys five floors numbering four rooms in each instance. The top floors exhibit a sizable reception room and office studio based around the containment and management of files. All other floors are parallel resembling a scientific testing facility containing multiple anomalous organisms presumably infected by SCP-7886-D

SCP-7886-D is an anomalous disease capable of infecting any abiotic and biotic organism. SCP-7886-D instances currently possess the ability to harbor themselves within any solid materials. This causes a slow but relatively unknown buildup of its structure and infection through the individual&#39;s bodily system. 

Foundation researchers stationed in SCP-7886 believe initial instances of SCP-7886-D manifested below the three anomalous points of interest (SCP-7886-A, SCP-7886-B, and SCP-7886-C) though the exact cause of this is unknown.

SCP-7886-D symptoms manifest an estimated one week after initial exposure, commonly varying depending on each subject&#39;s origin and genes. Due to this, an exact classification is currently impossible, though symptoms commonly found through multiple issues have been listed in the order they occur:

* “Bulbs” typically appear throughout exposed environments of a human&#39;s body (arms, legs, neck, etc) the size of which range from 2cm to 10cm across, meaning the growth will remain relatively unnoticed for an extended period. 
* Subjects report the relatively hollow weight and mass of the bulb for three days, causing its easy removal.
* Before the initial conclusion of the three days, the bulb will harden rapidly and reproduce causing proliferation and rapid expansion of bulbs throughout the subject&#39;s body.
*  Individuals commonly report a broadening and escalation process with each bulb seemingly multiplying once every two hours.
* An organism dubbed the “root” is released from the bulb penetrating multiple skin layers connecting with the bloodstream and DNA mutating the subject.
* The decomposition of skin and blood cells will occur rapidly causing the emission of a foul odor similar to fertilizer.
* Inflammation will rapidly and abruptly halt as multiple vital organs cease to assist the subject&#39;s body.
* The subject&#39;s metabolism may rapidly decrease to extremely low levels, causing the subject to survive more than 25 years without any form of consumption.
* Conditional behavior, motor functions, and instinctive behavioral mechanisms are severely impaired causing the individual to perform violent erratic behavior constantly. It prefers biting, grabbing, and stabbing the victim&#39;s heart before consuming it.
* The growth of multiple branches through the liver, elbows, and eyes will begin. Notably, after chemical and physical analysis of these branches Foundation Personnel determined the origins relating to human skin and bone cells.

              Further analysis of consistent symptoms is currently underway.

Initial reports of SCP-7886 originate from April 29, 1984, following the emission of a red mist from the Washington Monument. Examination of the substance revealed chemical similarities to human saliva, blood, and flesh. Upon further inspection, a large elevator grate was found capable of descending further than thought physically possible with modern technology. 

Multiple documents were found on the base of the elevator cabin, multiple sections appear to have been forcefully ripped out. The front-most intact piece of paper appears blurred by an unknown substance. The additional documents have been considered irrelevant. Efforts to transcribe the full document are currently underway.







 All declassified portions are listed below:



&gt; Upper Management has initiated Operation Rust, which means the full decommission of all sites. Make sure to collect all of your former belongings and double-check them to clarify the absence of “it” before leaving the site.

]]
Following a reconstruction and restoration effort in 1985, an estimated one hundred and three (103) corpses were excavated in the surrounding areas, the furthest one being an estimated 0.7 miles away from the monument&#39;s base. The body&#39;s attire originates from the 1860s, primarily one found on a Confederate soldier from the American Civil war. Each corpse currently houses a strand or prion related to SCP-7886 -D however following an autopsy report the primary source of death originated from a musket round.

Further excavation of the area revealed a substantial mass of SCP-7886 -D instances coalescing with forms of soil and rocks. Following the discovery, the O5-Order initiated Operation: Multitude the termination of all substances closely related to SCP-7886 -D in the proximity of the monument of at least one hundred miles. Termination efforts involve multiple high-end incineration methods in a fusillade process. 

Regrettably, strands of SCP-7886-D reached multiple water strains resulting in the thorough infection of parts of the Chesapeake Bay and Potomac River.

 Approximately 558 cases of SCP-7886-D are reported every year.

On October 19, 1985, multiple D-Class Personnel were dispatched to SCP-7886-A. Upon reaching the main entrance D-089 noticed a cardboard box resting in the middle of the elevator cabin. The front displayed a large label reading “The Truth and only the Truth”. Within the box contained a tape formerly belonging to Dr. Henry Dotchat. Each was presumably recorded following the decommissioning of SCP-7886-A documenting relevant events and his experience while working on the pacification of SCP-7886-D.

The following tapes have been transcribed below:

&gt; //[Begin Log]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[long bellowing sigh]//
&gt; 
&gt; In all my life, it never occurred to me that I would have to hide through lies and secrets a notion so frowned upon in the nation that I inhabit I assumed it could never be even conceived. I never thought I would face such evils, at least not at the age I currently am, just recently starting my fifties. I have to start the part where I create my memoir. And this part is tragic, confusing, and incomprehensible. 
&gt; 
&gt; But an event occurred, of such a scale, involving people with controversial interests, errors and victories, failures, and successes. There are so many interpretations of how and why something happened, which is why I feel a burden of truth resting on my shoulder. I feel almost obliged to explain what I know, how I see and understand it, and how I witnessed the events that occurred.
&gt; 
&gt; April 7th, 1984 was a Saturday, and a beautiful one at that. I sat quietly at my coffee table pondering the sudden influx of work I currently possessed. I had a choice of either going to the university department and finalizing some grades, inviting my close friend, Holton over so we could go shopping with my Wife at the new store “Katie&#39;s Clothes”, or of attending scientific party activists meeting that starts at 10 AM at the Ministry that currently supervises our institute. Of course because of my nature, and old habits, I called a cab and went to the activist&#39;s meeting.
&gt; 
&gt; Before the meeting, Dr. Nikoli Manchester, the CEO of the Columbia Scientific Research and Teaching Institutes, under whose supervision our entire university was, walked up to me with a calm but disappointed tone, that an unpleasant but minor accident had occurred in the Washington Underground Lab.
&gt;  
&gt; Keep in mind that the Washington Underground Lab was not classified, far from it. It was well known throughout the Columbian and Maryland Scientific community for its advancements in the genetic field. Many of our top scientists resided within the facility toiling away hours and making discoveries. Every slightly determined, capable, and able-bodied scientist wanted to join and research within this facility, so once I heard an accident occurred I was consumed with disbelief. The microscopic chance that anything occurred there was just preposterous at best. The fact one of the most well-funded scientific institutes in the country, potentially the world, has just experienced an accident of decent significance is strange, to say the least.
&gt; 
&gt; The report of minister Donald Rumsfeld began and was admittedly rather dull, standard, and mundane at best. We were all quite used to this very old yet good demagogue, with a loud confident voice, narrating how successful our ministry was performing for a minimum of an hour. All the metrics were perfect in his report: the best enterprises, the best technology, and all goals had been achieved. I could compare it similarly to a victory speech.
&gt;  
&gt; At points, he would often criticize a specialist proclaiming their obligation to improve work conditions, cease the poor rate of workplace accidents, or poor financial performance. All of which he boasted were crimes against freedom and everything the founding fathers stood for as if the founding fathers could see the future and our ascension to a top global power since they first gazed upon our land. 
&gt; 
&gt; He proceeded to praise the potential the country possesses in the face of modern genetic discoveries. He boasted and rambled something similar to this for thirty minutes until he was abruptly stopped by his Deputy, Paul Wolfowitz. He sat down for a second quietly listening to the scattered sound of Wolfowitz’s voice before hastily standing at attention. He posed in a way only a true warrior would do with confidence in a pose, none have yet to see. He declared a minor accident had occurred at the Washington Underground Lab, but as usual it was of little concern.
&gt; 
&gt; The room became quiet and tense so tense in fact that you required a knife just to cut it. No one moved or talked for probably only five minutes but yearned and hung for hours. Everyone was calculating the exact meaning of this message studying Donald Rumsfeld&#39;s posture, observing anything, anything at all capable of hunting the true nature of this event. Finally, some amateur professor stood up and yelled with an acute and spilled voice “What are you hiding from us?!”.
&gt; 
&gt; I thought he should have chosen different words and manners before talking. But that was not the tide the room was turning in, you could easily notice the influx of researchers and scientists nodding, preparing to stand up and represent their approval to this novice. Soon they were all hammering and repeating the same words he spoke “What are you hiding?!” chanting with a force reminiscent of a church bell.
&gt; 
&gt; Ronald Rumsfeld was sweating profusely now, clearly ready to cave to the crowd before him, seemingly stopped by a force we could not understand clearly. He looked wearily but proudly to the crowd stuttering as he attempted to announce the truth. His eyes met mine and he blankly stood watching my reactions for only a moment before repeating the process of attempted speaking. 
&gt; 
&gt; He then swiftly held up his hand announcing silence to the room before saying these words I cannot forget, &#34;The Danger is Real at the Washington Underground Lab, we need experienced researchers and scientists to assist the Military&#39;s clean-up effort of the area.”
&gt; 
&gt; A wave of disbelief rocked the crowd knocking everyone formerly standing back down to their seats. Only whispers gasped in between the crowds as they pondered the meaning of this event. We all believed the statements given to us the ones that proclaimed the intelligence and work ethic of the Washington Scientist. We have forgotten that they are also human, prone to errors and miscalculations. Our species have done it since the dawn of time and thought helps us improve it can lead to destruction unimaginable until you gaze upon it with your own eyes. 
&gt; 
&gt; Then I stood up, I don&#39;t know what came over me, honestly. All eyes around the room looked toward me with confusion and respect. Soon many others stood declaring their involvement in the cleanup. Soon after only one minute half of the room stood bravely and passionately announcing their name and their help in the face of danger. I think I shed a little tear then, so many young men are ready to help and potentially give their lives for the salvation of others.
&gt; 
&gt; “Good” Rumsfield had said in an approving yet sorrowful voice, you will all be notified when services are required. Then he popped himself up and left the stage, just like that. 
&gt;

&gt; //&lt;Begin Log&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; Today was April 27, 1984, a Sunday. It was a wistful one too, the birds were chirping peacefully as they fed their kin. Butterflies moved freely past the bushes, houses, and plateaus slowly finding a flower with the prospect of extracting nectar to survive. The sun came from its burrow revealing its incredible beauty with colors undefinable and unseen coming to seeming to reveal themselves and sprout. During that time I felt the world stopped just so I could think and view with a peace none have experienced. 
&gt; 
&gt; A knock soon presented itself at my door by a man so skinny but short looking, similar to a dwarf in a Disney movie. He gave me a letter bound by a seal reminiscent of the Department of Defense. Within it read my resignation as a university teacher and my recruitment into the Head of the United States Anomalous Cleanup Task Force. Typical of a letter like this, it proclaimed how my involvement would save many lives, but it never specified the exact thing I would be saving them from.
&gt; 
&gt; The man proceeded to point quietly at a black car stereotypical for the secret service in most Hollywood movies. Understandably I entered the car as I was told, moving carefully to not disturb and defy the man&#39;s orders as he was uncomfortable waking up at such an early time. Sitting in the car presented two larger men a couple of inches taller than me both wearing police hats and black sunglasses. Separating us lay a large soundproof glass grate, most likely installed to hide any secretive chatter from the front of the car that could potentially reveal classified information. 
&gt; 
&gt; We began driving silently for around twenty minutes only to hear the car rumble, pushing and smashing the granite mixed concrete which surprisingly still sustains itself after such large amounts of pressure being put onto it. I sat leaning my head further into the window listening to its echoes intensify as we entered the main highway. The cold mood within the car soon stuttered as clouds departed from the dusk sky revealing a blue light, giving a calm feeling to a tense environment.
&gt; 
&gt; I must have passed out for a little while since after I opened my eyes there was this huge structure (I assume the Washington Monument) but there was something off about it. Standing there were hoards of people, all properly equipped with firearms and incendiary devices. Others wore trench or lab coats with a large gas masks strapped around their forehead studying samples of an unknown substance. 
&gt; 
&gt; And we happened to park right in the middle of it all. I was ordered to disembark from the vehicle, and before I stood a crowd of scientists, researchers, biologists, you know the whole lot of them. I admittedly did recognize some of them from the university I teach while others I recognized from magazines. Such a large abundance of scientific community members, famous and unknown, stood before the base of the event.
&gt; 
&gt; This was something bigger than I could comprehend, so I asked one of the guards what exactly was going on here. He seemed a little miffed about my question but begrudgingly replied with “it escaped” pointing towards the general direction of the Washington Monument.
&gt; 
&gt; I could see a strange substance appear to surround it similar to one of human flesh. Eyes appeared in nooks and cracks capable of being filled. There was even a sort of organ system in play with a chunk of a lung observed attaching itself to the bottom of the monument&#39;s base. It looked just like an ancient ruin in some sort of demented Sci-Fi show. Whatever this thing consumed the entire monument, leaving no stone unturned, and it just kept spreading. It seemed to move into the stone plates surrounding the monument but the guards incinerated the strains before it had a chance to manifest.
&gt; 
&gt; Soon a large elevator grate presented itself appearing as the only operable and slightly human thing left standing within the monument. Multiple individuals equipped with flamethrowers exited the elevator and incinerated portions of the growth surrounding the elevator. 
&gt; 
&gt; The agents gave me subtle nudges to proceed into the elevator but I was hesitant, this was something never before seen on the face of the Earth. How did they expect me out of anybody to help solve it? Looking at that elevator I deeply regretted standing up but, I knew I was too far gone to back out now. So I entered the elevator and descended with it.
&gt; 
&gt; As we descended I could see the same growths on the surface appeared to grow in number and mass through the outskirts barely dragging along the elevator practically touching it. The further I viewed it the more I believed the perceived heartbeats emitting from the vein, almost resembling a human. Stress could not accurately portray my emotions during that time, there was a sense of desperation and fight in the air I doubt many people have felt. You could tell this was something new, something no one understood, and no one could solve. 
&gt; 
&gt; As we neared our destination the strains became a mass, manifesting an object I can only describe as a wall of flesh. It was seemingly living but dying, soon after making eye contact with me it began producing a horrible screeching. That screeching it produced was so deathly I felt my ears bleeding and peeling straight off my body. I was physically collapsing bringing myself to the ground before a guard handed me headphones which I had very hastily equipped. Suddenly I was at peace, no noise could be heard except my heartbeat and the voice of others mumbling. 
&gt; 
&gt; By now we had reached our destination and as the gates opened it revealed a sorrowful sight. The walls displayed unrestrained strands of flesh slowly multiplying by producing some sort of “bump”. Multiple military personnel attempted to incinerate these bumps but appeared to have difficulty, with the bumps seemingly adapted to incendiary devices making their termination further prolonged. 
&gt;
&gt; I could spot a makeshift hospital constructed near the left far side probably containing forty people resting on bunk beds all benign treated by a collection of doctors, nurses, and biologists for some godforsaken reason. Noticeably part of their skin was… decomposing, turning into something like rotting bark. One of the individuals looked rabid attempting to attack one of the doctors before being shot in the cranium by a nearby guard&#39;s firearm. He bled a red mist and dissolved.

&gt; 
&gt; That thoroughly shook me, I&#39;m not going to lie. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Chuckles quietly.]//
&gt; 
&gt; Turns out his name was Jack Little, I knew him during college. We were good friends, I would say he would help me with my homework and I would help him get over his strange fears. It was a deal of mutual sufficiency and we both cherished it. Unfortunately, we lost contact with each other after college, and well I never heard from him again, until now.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyways I&#39;m getting off track here, where was I? Oh yes, the uh structure. 
&gt; 
&gt; We located the armory due southwest of the medical facility where I conceded supplied with a Military-Grade Hazmat Suit and a 1911 Pistol. I must admit I was rather skeptical of equipping a loaded firearm since like any book has taught me gaining a weapon does not give me safety but presents the potential hazards and threats that lie ahead of me. Boy, I was right.
&gt; 
&gt; I was assigned to enter an area nicknamed &#34;Hornets Nest&#34; by the scientists currently studying it. The name serves it right, the number of bulbs and spikes in the area certainly exceeded the normal quantity, noticed in the other sectors. The most violent events took place within the sector and, the most effective studying strategy was a head-first assault straight into its maw.
&gt; 
&gt; You could tell this was a heavily scrutinized activity due to the often complaints from nearby assigned staff usually mentioning the high-risk factor and casualty rate. No one wanted to set foot into the maw, but in the end, we perceived that a choice we did not have.
&gt; 
&gt; I was assigned to Search Team-05 likely after an hour-long period of management and staff movement. I was to be their squad leader due to my experience with abnormal substances and genetics. I could scarcely recognize multiple amateur scientists from the university most likely assigned due to their proximity to the lab.
&gt; 
&gt; I sat down next to them and chatted for what must have been fifteen minutes. We mostly discussed the possible genetic structure and nature of the substance, but we scarcely mentioned family members and memories though we all avoided details to encourage the pacification of our deeper feelings. 
&gt;
&gt; The danger was only too clear, as we watched the large military gate open we witnessed a scene only seen in only in the most horrid of nightmares. Large cylindrical tendrils and spikes poured from its basin only stopping in an area likely carved as a pathway. One piece of meat similar to cow udders appeared on one far side as they detached like an animal emerging from an egg while multiple limbs reminiscent of a human emerged. It revealed an unknown entity with a face similar to one of a cow. Its maw perceived multiple teeth both carnivore and omnivore, it seemed to spot me because after emerging it emitted a death-defying screech before charging me. 
&gt; 
&gt; It lunged at me attempting to impact my forehead but seemingly missed instead hitting my squad mate, Kade striking his right kneecap and proceeding to consume it. Kade began to flail his leg wildly attempting to detach the monster while screaming at the top of his lungs &#34;GET IT OFF&#34; repeatedly. It took a couple of tries but he eventually detached it, flinging it into a nearby crate seemingly knocking it unconscious and falling to its base.
&gt; 
&gt; A guard stationed at the door moved towards it before putting three rounds directly into what I assume is its forehead before pointing sternly at Kade steadily moving his finger towards the general direction of the medical center. Kade attempted to resist the guard&#39;s request, but eventually, he was pacified by the idea of a bullet directly into his head. The guard proceeded to nudge us back into the &#34;Hornets Nest&#34; adamantly insisting we renew our mission as that event never occurred.
&gt; 
&gt; He kept pointing his gun at me specifically demanding that we re-enter the sector but I dislodged him after explaining the necessary quantity and replenishment of a new squad member. He seemed to like what I said because he affirmatively moved his head before saying &#34;rest&#34; in a deep tone and leaving to resume his post.
&gt; 
&gt; We spent the rest of our break waiting for our new team member, everyone stood quiet. Kade we all knew was as good as dead. No one even dared make even a peep after what happened, we just sat there contemplating what animated horrors lay beyond the gate that protects us. The suits I guessed don&#39;t protect us from the majority of things within the &#34;Hornets Nest&#34; likely only worn to prevent airborne substances from infecting us. 
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever was behind that door displayed an evil awakening I had to prepare for. I decided to head towards the armory equipping myself with automatic weapons, grenades, and a plentiful quantity of ammo for the entire squad. We must arm ourselves to fight evil we cannot comprehend I would say! That&#39;s what the founding fathers would do, probably.
&gt; 
&gt; Eventually after what must have been an hour our new squad member arrived, his name was Jerrico, a young but seasoned scientist. He greeted us in a cheerful tone, but we were still rocked by that monster that we barely acknowledged him, less his existence. We were all going to die anyways, what&#39;s the point of connecting when you are just going to lose it anyways?
&gt; 
&gt; We stood up simultaneously loaded our firearms and proceeded into the &#34;Hornet&#39;s Nest&#34;, stressed, afraid, and suicidal.

&gt; 
&gt; This place is truly greater than a labyrinth, more complex, and more mind-boggling. All identifiers have long since been consumed by the fleshy substance dwelling across the wall. It worsens after each corner, more spikes, more flesh, it soon became less of a scientific facility and now another universe. I mean my god... what happened here?! 
&gt; 
&gt; Strangely enough none of those unnatural creatures appeared only the skittering and clicking sounds they produce. This of course didn&#39;t help the nerves, I walked unable to predict the source of the sound. Though I did notice the further I moved the sounds soon closely becoming deafening similar to a family of crickets in the night.  
&gt; 
&gt; We proceeded to trudge toward the main reactor, which of course happens to consist of nuclear power. That explains the abnormal growth of this anomaly but not the creatures it produces. Could this substance possibly relate to disease?  It&#39;s unlikely but anything is possible now isn&#39;t it?
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Boss? Boss? Boss, can you hear me?&#34;
&gt; I didn&#39;t realize Jerrico was attempting to communicate with me. Yes Jerrico, I responded making my best effort not to come off aggravated. 
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Uh look up&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; A colossal structure so picturesque and fragile stood, resembling a magnificent tree. Dear god, it was huge my eyes could scarcely believe it. No such things existed on this planet quite like it. I was basked in its greatness I witnessed what appeared to be a humanoid-ish figure statued upon one of its mighty branches.
&gt; 
&gt; It seemed to peer straight back at me gazing into my eyes. I don&#39;t necessarily understand why I perceived this notion it was kind of unexplainable. The figure stood up seemingly blurring rapidly as though it was currently moving further away. Then in just a singular moment it superficially ceased blurring and jumped off the branch of the tree. I currently contain no information on whether or not that thing ceased to exist but I speculate the truth.
&gt; 
&gt; **Note**: A sound is audible in the background only picked up by the recording reminiscent of a falling tree.
&gt; 
&gt; We decided to proceed directly towards the colossal structure, though one of my squad mates, Henry strongly opposed the move and made sure he displayed displeasure at every possible occurrence. I know he only committed to this act to pester me but I feel it was more of an act of comfort, it was too quiet. Our sanities were already leaking near the boiling point so I chose to allow him to pester me at least it was a comfort even if it was negative.
&gt; 
&gt; After re-watching monitor reports I concluded we had walked at least an hour before initially arriving at the tree base. Though, the appearance and size seem to never change no matter the distance and proximity we arrive in. On close inspection of the material, it was soft as human skin but rough like a bone. A small crack presented itself close to the base gushing an unknown substance. It was revealed a lack of wood containing only blood genetically similar to that of a human, most likely representing the sap of a common tree. 
&gt; 
&gt; I placed my ear to the side of the tree&#39;s trunk expecting a sustained silence but was replaced by a pounding similar to a heartbeat. The tree showed vital signs, it was a living organism. Such an interesting discovery, a living organism formed by a disease, this could revolutionize the industry, this is the start of a new era. For the better or the worse though I do suspect the ladder.
&gt; 
&gt; The fluid seems to configure into a living mass, reminiscent of a humanoid of grotesque proportions. It let out a faint wail similar to crying before collapsing in on itself most likely caused by its uneven structure.
&gt; 
&gt; Many of these instances soon sprout from the ground directly around us all seeming to gaze upon us blankly from what I assume were their pupils. They remained stone statues for a good period, before trailing off every which way some attempting to advance into the tree regularly blundering becoming stuck in stray objects around the perimeter before giving up. The ones that did make it seemed to phase directly into the tree, almost offering its body as a source of nutrients. 
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly what makes these things tick is certainly unknown though I suspect a semi-hive mind is in the works of course no evidence has presented itself. I noticed one of the masses configuring itself toward me, stopping only a couple of meters from my face. I swear I heard the faintest noise as if it were attempting to communicate but a strange force transpired to prevent his action. 
&gt; 
&gt; It said, and now remember this is only a guess, &#34;Thy tree produces thy end of the world. Its fruit bears death and life. He has chosen the tree instead of the snake. Save us from the false shepherd, free our souls from satan incarnate.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; That caught me well off guard, I mean would you suspect a sort of jelly blob to speak such riddles preaching the incarnation of satan himself? I don&#39;t profess the ideas of Jesus nor do I believe in any sort of God, after all, I am a scientist am I not? 
&gt; 
&gt; I stood blankly gazing stonily into the mass eyes and it looked back displaying a stern and truthful state. It wasn&#39;t lying, it couldn&#39;t he twitched and was riddled clearly in pain, only just standing after a period of great determination. This was not a creation of nature but of man. 
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;You were a scientist weren&#39;t you?&#34; I asked unsure of the answer it produced. It gave me the faintest of affirmative nods, holding out its hand and displaying an ID card, reading &#34;Head-Researcher Michael Davis&#34;. It seized my 1911 firearm before gesturing towards its forehead and placing it in my palm. 
&gt; 
&gt; His wish was for me to end his suffering, but I could not oblige. But he was in pain and I... 
&gt; 
&gt; //[soft weeping]//
&gt; 
&gt; --I just-- I need a moment please I just, I&#39;m truly sorry, I am-- I&#39;m just not used to talking about it.
&gt; 
&gt; But his eyes I just could not say no to them so I, I-- I raised my hand planting the gun at his forehead, closed my eyes and-- and, shot...
&gt; 
&gt; [Weeping grows Louder]
&gt; 
&gt; What have we become to create something like this? To cause one of our humanity, our species to suffer just for the research and discovery to possibly advance ourselves?! This is not how science is supposed to occur, science requires sacrifices but only personal ones, deaths are not science it&#39;s just murder.
&gt; 
&gt; We are not cattle to slaughter just for the advancement and continued prosperity of the higher-ups. This is not the world I grew up in, the world has been taken away from me by greed, corruption, by evil. I cannot allow this to continue onwards.
&gt; 
&gt; So I have passed my tapes onwards to Jerrico, he is the best of us, the one with the mightiest future. I do hope he makes us all proud and transforms the world for the better. As for me, I&#39;m not leaving the Hornets Nest, I have chosen to sacrifice myself for the greater good, of humanity. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have set three grenades next to the nuclear generator. The explosion should cause decent enough damage causing the generator to implode and incinerate all things in a decent radius. I&#39;m not gonna detonate it instantly that would be foolish, I&#39;m gonna wait an hour so I can continue to antiquate myself with the blood people, plus Jerrico and the team need to warn the others in the facility of looming damage. 
&gt; 
&gt; The implosion should incinerate the tree but due to its massive nature, it will form a strong barrier against the explosion causing the blast to not expand outside into the city. No other humans will be harmed by this thing. 
&gt; 
&gt; Remember me as I lived, but not by what I have done. Though this tape may never be uncovered by public light, I choose to allow its secrets to spread for the greater prosperity of humanity. God bless America, and God bless Humanity. Maybe my efforts weren&#39;t fruitless after all.

The following implosion caused massive radiation fallout throughout the facility, although most scientists and personnel stationed within it managed to escape any permanent and temporary injuries. Foundation personnel have noted the two new entities discovered by Dr. Dotchat and currently awaiting approval to uncover and test them for classification within the archive.

[[&lt;]]

On ██, ██, 20██ near the ████████ region of the Appalachian Mountains severe seismic activity occurred at the site of the suspected location of SCP-7886 fifth instance. The seismic activity was reportedly mixed with an anomalous earthquake with a scale of 9.2, lasting for one minute (1) and causing 43 civilian casualties. Following the earthquake&#39;s conclusion, an unknown object emerged reminiscent of the famous General Sherman with a notable lack of leaves and branches. Foundation assets were scrambled toward the area.

Excavation of the tree found it contains roots that can extend for an approximate depth of 40m. However, further excavation efforts have revealed the introduction of materials composed chemically similar to SCP-7886-D manifesting far deeper, with the lowest at a depth of 120m. It is considered likely that multiple of these materials potentially interact with layers of the earth the bulk of living subjects cannot be sustained within.

Large quantities of SCP-7886-D strains manifest throughout nearby trees, rocks, mountains, and water. What spreads these substances is currently unknown though it has been hypothesized the use of large underground tunnels.

Following a period of three days, the tree de-manifested leaving a large mass of substances currently infected. No known contact can be made with any objects without infection hazards. Site-███ has been established to contain the mass. Each day following noon a controlled burning is to take place.

The excavation of the surrounding areas is considered a high priority.
