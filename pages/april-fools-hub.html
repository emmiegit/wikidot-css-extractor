+ What is April Fools&#39; Day?

April Fools&#39; is a miserable time in which nobody can trust their senses and people find a particular joy in lying through their teeth.

People create pages as April Fools&#39; Day jokes. 

Many of these pages end up being deleted. Many do not.

This page organizes and celebrates the large amount of valuable work that survives this day.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
++++ Adding to this page:
As this page was created a decade after the first recorded April Fools Day jokes on the wiki, some pages may be missing. This page was originally created by LORDXVNV for navigational purposes and historical preservation, who used a methodology of manually reading through pages created within 36 hours of a given April 1st, using context clues such as author post, content, or first-revision comment to determine if they were created for April Fools.

If you are the author of a missing page, you may add them, unless they were written for a contest that has its own hub, which as of April 2022 are the Crack Fiction and Creck Fiction 2 contests. This is to reduce clutter. Please wait until April 3 before linking your pranks to make sure they&#39;ve survived.

Do not add other peoples&#39; pages unless they state it was written for April Fools. Conversely, if you were the author of a page on this list and it was not intended for April Fools, please feel free to remove it.
