hi, my name is luca. you can call me luca or ocuin, i don&#39;t really mind. im irish but im currently living in england.

im an artist working primarily with photography and the visual arts. i use archive media and arts and analogue processes within my own photography to explore the histories of peoples and places, the ways those people and places have changed, and the associated interpersonal relationships, amongst other topics. im currently finishing up my undergraduate degree in photography and preparing for a cohort grad show in london in july 2024 at the bargehouse.

my main project focus at the moment is a project exploring my hometown enniskillen, and the difficulties of identity in a post-conflict society - not just one divided by sectarian violence, but one portrayed as being saturated with violence. enniskillen was the site of a bomb in 1987 which killed 11 people, and this project explores the tensions between the identity of a town victim to the bomb and the rest of life in the town as well as painting a portrait of the realities of life in a small town in rural ireland.

i joined the wiki back in 2020 and was staff for most of the time since then but i&#39;ve been retired now and i&#39;m half-about some of the time. i like to write weird short stories that give the reader a puzzle to untangle or a mystery to guess at, as well as stories that use the format to make interesting commentary on the world we live in. (i have not actually successfully written any of the latter yet)

so far i&#39;ve only got the three articles:
[[[SCP-4752]]]
[[[SCP-6285]]]
[[[SCP-6179]]]

but we&#39;re working on expanding that, slowly. the wiki isn&#39;t my focus really but i enjoy the space it provides for unique takes on fiction and art, and the community here means a lot to me, so im trying to be around from time to time.

you can find some examples of my photography and the projects im working on on my website lucaquinn.com or my instagram @o_cuin.

otherwise there&#39;s not much to say. i dont go online much anymore so i am difficult to contact at the best of times, i like nice coffees and wines, i like trains and public transport. i like a good pint of guinness but i try not to drink too much anymore. i play the guitar, my granda taught me and ive been playing for the last 15 years. as you can tell i&#39;m not too concerned about my public persona and my scp persona being separate. if you find something bad you can do with any of this information i congratulate you.

that&#39;s about it.
