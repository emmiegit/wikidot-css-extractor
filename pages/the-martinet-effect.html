&#34;I don&#39;t get it.&#34;

Dr. William Wettle looked over his shoulder, irritation creasing his pudgy bearded face. &#34;You don&#39;t get //what.//&#34;

&#34;I don&#39;t get the purpose of this test.&#34; Dr. Bastien LeBlanc pointed at the battered Nikon in Wettle&#39;s hands. &#34;That camera&#39;s been around for ages, do we not understand it already? It&#39;s so well-known, it&#39;s [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-515-arc archived]. I thought one of our researchers even built the damn thing.&#34;

&#34;Yeah,&#34; said Wettle. He raised it to the observation glass, pressed the shutter button, and sighed when nothing happened. &#34;Kondraki. And he was the only one who really understood how it worked.&#34;

&#34;So why don&#39;t we just ask him?&#34;

Wettle flipped the camera over and fumbled with its casing, failing spectacularly to remove anything. &#34;Hnnh. Everything else makes sense, but we can&#39;t figure out how it takes pictures without using light. The file says it focuses &#39;on a subject&#39;s [DATA EXPUNGED]&#39;. What&#39;s a [DATA EXPUNGED]? An aura? A soul? Body odour? What?&#34;

Bastien blinked. &#34;I said, why don&#39;t we just ask him?&#34;

Wettle looked up and blinked back. &#34;Ask Kondraki?&#34;

&#34;Yeah, why not?&#34;

Wettle blinked again, more slowly. &#34;Why not ask Kondraki?&#34;

&#34;Yeah!&#34;

&#34;Because Kondraki&#39;s //dead?//&#34;

Bastien&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;When did that happen?&#34;

Wettle set the camera down. &#34;Like... a decade ago? Are you serious? Somebody shot him in the head.&#34; He gestured. &#34;That&#39;s why we have his camera?&#34;

Bastien frowned. &#34;I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re getting //that// from. Kondraki&#39;s the Director of Site-17. I saw him the other day.&#34;

Wettle&#39;s beady little eyes narrowed dangerously; the danger was that he wouldn&#39;t be able to see at all, which typically resulted in his falling over. &#34;Kondraki is dead,&#34; he repeated, slowly. &#34;He tried to ride the lizard, and got shot for it.&#34;

Bastien laughed. &#34;Now you&#39;re just making stuff up! He was there when they recaptured 682 last October, didn&#39;t you hear? Benjamin Kondraki, problematic hero of the SCP Foundation.&#34;

Wettle screwed up his face even more than it was already screwed up. &#34;Where&#39;s this &#39;Benjamin&#39; shit coming from? Nobody&#39;s ever heard his first name.&#34;

Bastien looked at him sympathetically. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, sir, but this must be the Martinet Effect.&#34;

The mess of conflicted emotions fell away, and Wettle was left with just one: confusion. &#34;What the hell is the Martinet Effect?&#34;

Bastien looked confused now, too. &#34;Multiverse theory thing? Where some people remember Charles Martinet stepping down last year as the voice of Mario, which never actually happened, so they think they&#39;re from an alternate timeline?&#34;

It took Wettle three tries to get the next sentence out: &#34;Isn&#39;t that... isn&#39;t that the //Mandela// Effect?&#34; The first try had produced no sound at all.

&#34;The what?&#34; Bastien was clearly concerned. &#34;What would that even refer to? You sure you don&#39;t mean mandala?&#34;

Wettle glanced down at the camera, then back up at Bastien. He was breathing very shallowly. &#34;Pack that up, will you?&#34; he asked, his voice raising querulously high on the final syllables as he pushed past his subordinate and rushed out the door.

&#34;Where&#39;s Wettle?&#34;

Bastien finished chewing his chicken sandwich as Dr. Lillian Lillihammer slid her tray next to his and sat down. He took a moment to enjoy the taste before responding: &#34;Health and Pathology.&#34;

Lillihammer rolled her eyes and picked up the hamburger on her plate. &#34;What for this time?&#34;

&#34;Hume check. Thinks he&#39;s in an alternate dimension.&#34;

Lillihammer guffawed into her meat patty, rather messily, then dabbed at her mouth with a napkin. &#34;I mean, it //is// September, that //does// happen. But I&#39;m pretty sure the rest of us would have noticed. Why&#39;s he think that?&#34;

Bastien smiled. &#34;Because someone told me he hadn&#39;t gone in for his physical this year.&#34; He noticed Dr. Blank walking past, and grinned up at him. &#34;Thanks for the video game reference, worked a treat.&#34;

Blank mock-saluted as he headed for the buffet, and Bastien met Lillihammer&#39;s confused gaze again. &#34;Friends don&#39;t let friends skip prostate exams, you know?&#34;
