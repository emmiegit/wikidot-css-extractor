[[span class=&#34;bt&#34;]]SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:[[/span]] The containment cycles of all SCP-001-K instances are to be maintained at all costs. Monitoring of each cycle is to take place within a dedicated observation room, using methods incapable of undermining the balance of their respective anomalies.

Observation and the enactment of individual containment protocols are to remain wholly compartmentalized and classified from one another. To ensure compliance with this mandate, all personnel are physically prohibited from accessing containment zones apart from their own, and inter-zone communications have been made inexecutable. Thus, each zone must possess the resources necessary to sustain personnel until their expiry. The master containment document is accessible to Level-5 personnel and above.

Should the containment sigils in any zone become compromised, attendant personnel are to prepare for direct intervention.

SCP-001 is to be staffed entirely by personnel who have been tried and sentenced by Overwatch Command for offenses against our organization and its core principles. While the potential for further insubordination among personnel stationed at SCP-001 remains a credible threat to its continued function, the ramifications of subversive actions has thus far served as a means of effective behavioral moderation across the board.

Only Level-6 personnel are to be read-in to the ritualistic aspects of consigning personnel to the upkeep of SCP-001. In classified internal documentation below the level of Top Secret, this type of conviction is to be referred to as &#34;Keter Duty&#34;.

Traditionally, this subset of penal code was used solely for traitors to the organization. However, as more instances of SCP-001-K are discovered, the sentencing of Keter Duty has expanded to cover the following infractions:

* The use of anomalous objects or phenomena for one&#39;s own gain (i.e.: material wealth or personal well-being)
* Intentional use of anomalous objects or phenomena outside controlled settings without the consent of Overwatch Command
* Breaches of secrecy involving friends and family becoming acutely aware of one&#39;s position or role within the organization
* Having intimate relations with anomalous entities in containment
* Violation of containment protocols due to either gross negligence or through premeditated actions
* General insubordination

In case of containment failure, personnel are to enter the chamber of a broken containment cycle to reestablish order. The doors are to be sealed behind them.

[[span class=&#34;bt&#34;]]DESCRIPTION:[[/span]] SCP-001 is a facility designed for the containment of anomalous objects and phenomena which are either uncontainable, or whose attributes would require a nigh-insurmountable amount of resources or technological prowess to contain indefinitely -- a containment class codified during the genesis of our organization&#39;s founding as Keter.

The facility itself is nondescript externally, excepting the fact that its outer appearance mildly varies over time and between persons, defying attempts to document a concrete structure. This ambiguity continues into its internal layout -- attempts to concretely map out the interior have invariably failed and have resulted in the loss of countless personnel to date. The only sustaining characteristic is the existence and number of containment zones. Despite having been discovered in pre-modern times, with the earliest references to the facility having been recorded in ~730 A.D., it has always possessed technology and architecture on-par with militaristic facilities circa the late 1900s. Some areas of SCP-001 have been rendered inaccessible due to containment failures, and are inhospitable to human life.

The halls of SCP-001 are broken into several hundred unique containment zones, each housing a pair of anomalous objects or phenomena whose anomalous traits serve to counteract each other in perpetuity. The entrance to each containment chamber has been marked with symbols of occult significance, ostensibly tied to Kabbalistic teachings. Damage to these symbols ultimately leads to the upsetting of balance between its respective pair of anomalies. Introducing human variables into containment cycles has been proven to be the sole method of reestablishing order.

Failure to maintain cycles has disastrous consequences: where one anomaly is unable to serve as a counterbalance, the other is permitted to operate unchecked. This often manifests as a disruption of local reality surrounding the containment area, where the rules governing the unrestricted anomaly become the new paradigm. This has also historically resulted in the zone&#39;s contents being loosed from the facility and into the world.

Half of all anomalous subjects within SCP-001 (one per containment zone) were concretely documented upon discovery and formed the basis for documentation standards among our burgeoning organization. These have been formally categorized under their original designations. There existed no mentions of the opposing anomalies, which have been studied, interrogated, and catalogued in the years since. These anomalies have been designated SCP-001-K.

[[span class=&#34;bt&#34;]]Addendum 001-A:[[/span]]

Despite having been under Foundation purview for over a century, the core of SCP-001 has only recently been uncovered by an expeditionary force. Recovered documentation included briefings on the chamber&#39;s contents, as well as a missive for the Foundation Administrator. Survivors of this expedition have since been released from duty as a reward for their service.
