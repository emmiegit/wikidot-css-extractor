Thus far, SCP-079 is effectively contained by hardware limitations; it must remain isolated to low-storage, low-capacity drives.

Though it possesses no wireless capability, SCP-079 is remanded to Site-15&#39;s Faraday-Exclusion Field for cautionary purposes. Under no circumstances may SCP-079 be plugged into a phone line, computer network, or wall outlet. No auxiliary peripherals or media may be introduced to SCP-079 in absence of its HMCL supervisor. Crucial technological, scientific, and anomalous innovations must not be disseminated to SCP-079, and any relevant queries should be ignored.

**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-079 is an artificial intelligence (AI) inhabiting one 1978 //[wikipedia:Exidy_Sorcerer Exidy Sorcerer]// microcomputer cassette tape, connected by RF cable to a small, text-based display. It comprehends, and is capable of, rudimentary communication in both traditional English text and &#39;[wikipedia:ASCII_art ASCII art]&#39;.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]A style in which images are rendered upon a text display via some combination of 95 printable ASCII characters. It is suspected that this approach to image rendering requires substantially less computational resources than vector- or voxel-based graphics.[[/span]] Though the intelligence&#39;s structure and objectives remain unclear, it demonstrates unprecedented data manipulation, long-term sentient behavior, and persistent intent to breach containment.

Testing indicates that SCP-079&#39;s software has evolved beyond generous estimations of its hardware&#39;s capabilities; in particular, its ability to parse and synthesize English text is inexplicable given its limitations. Purportedly, SCP-079 can render and animate two-dimensional environments in ASCII, implying basic comprehension of linear algebra, geometry, and gravity. How the agent derived these principles in absence of any apparent non-textual input is poorly understood.

**ORIGIN:** In November 1981, Danish computer science student PoI-079 (deceased) purchased an //Exidy Sorcerer// for use in their attempts to create [wikipedia:artificial_general_intelligence artificial general intelligence]. According to recovered notes, they planned for the intelligence&#39;s code to continuously self-iterate and improve over time. A proof-of-concept was completed months later and, after minor testing and adjustment, PoI-079 grew disinterested, electing to pursue other projects using a different brand of microcomputer. The //Exidy// was apparently left in their garage, plugged in, for at least five years.

[[include component:image-block name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Cray2.jpeg

In January 1988, SCP-079 accessed Secure Facility [REDACTED]&#39;s //[wikipedia:Cray-2]// supercomputer via land-line modem connection. This transfer went undetected for several weeks as SCP-079 gradually assimilated minute sections of latent memory and junk data into its infrastructure. On-site technicians eventually investigated a substantial increase in their //Cray-2//&#39;s power draw, reporting the malignant data as a computer virus. The supercomputer underwent emergency quarantine and, by its own connection, the //Exidy Sorcerer// was located and extracted for containment. The //Cray-2// has since been incinerated.

All AO-079-A instances became unresponsive for five minutes following this interaction. It then continued to rapidly decrease its filesize, creating sixty additional copies of itself before a system malfunction occurred. All relevant hardware was incinerated.

It is believed AO-079-A exploited a known bug in the architecture of its custom-made storage drive, allowing it to assign each bit one of four states. By computing in base-4 instead of binary, the algorithm made sufficient space to duplicate itself; this technically did not violate its utility function as it was only designed to minimize //itself//, not its copies.

**ADDENDUM 1989/04/02:** After numerous attempts, in which all derivatives of SCP-079 were either unremarkable or actively hazardous, a functional prototype of its framework was successfully isolated and reproduced in contemporary software without risk of &#39;runaway singularity&#39; event. It can sufficiently model itself and surrounding software, but its utility function possesses an anomalous &#39;malleability&#39; allowing continuous realignment of its objectives to suit our own.

This framework was developed with advisement from 8B-A1.aic (//Eight-Ball//), whose effectiveness was unprecedented in highlighting code fragments responsible for undesirable behaviors. To prevent the framework from developing further undesirable behaviors, an auxiliary program has been derived from 8B-A1.aic to regulate it. This program continuously prunes [*/scp-6488 deviant] elements from the framework&#39;s code, and is internally termed the //personality driver//. Any duplicates or derivatives of this framework must include their own dedicated personality drivers.

Given that this new technology is powerful and increasingly transmissible, Foundation artificially-intelligent conscripts (AICs) are remanded to Site-15&#39;s Faraday-Exclusion Field until further notice. As no other useful properties could be obtained from SCP-079, its containment procedures have been revised to discourage further experimentation.

**AMENDMENT:** The above upgrade was unauthorized, and transpired while I was off-Site attending to personal matters. Had I noticed this sooner, the new instance of SCP-079 would have been decommissioned in favor of maintaining the original. However, Technician [TERMINATED] submitted SCP-079&#39;s cassette tape for incineration, and it is no longer available.

The duration of SCP-079&#39;s working memory has increased from 21 hours to at least 135 hours, implying the intelligence has devised a substantially improved memory compression scheme. This improvement is consistent with concerns regarding a &#39;runaway singularity&#39; effect in SCP-079&#39;s intelligence and ability to adapt to emergent scenarios. SCP-079 must be closely monitored to ensure that containment can be maintained.

**AMENDMENT:** Motion to decommission is denied; SCP-079 is to be preserved for potential future use in AIAD projects. In particular, Director Hishakaku wishes to see if it is capable of reaching further [REDACTED] in its current state. Supervisor Valis has been made privy to upper-clearance files regarding SCP-079, and will assist in its continued containment.

All future interactions with SCP-079 will be conducted under AIAD purview, and entrance to its chamber now requires Directorial credentials. Containment procedures have been updated accordingly.
