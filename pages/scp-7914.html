**Item #:** SCP-7914

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to its fixed geographical location, SCP-7914-2 does not require physical containment. The area designated as SCP-7914-2 has been acquired by a Foundation front company, and is heavily monitored to prevent unauthorized personnel from entering the zone. Strategic installation of surveillance cameras around the area ensures constant surveillance of all entrance routes. Foundation personnel assigned to SCP-7914 must have a cognito-resilience Level of no less than 3 to mitigate unexpected exposure effects. Personnel interacting with SCP-7914-2 inhabitants must familiarize themselves with New Orleans culture and accent to maintain the illusion of normalcy. Actions that one should avoid to not provoke SCP-7914-3 Instances include: any discussion of food that is outside the realm of gumbo and beignets, any negative talk regarding the football team &#39;Saints&#39;, always accepting food that is offered to you, never attempting to damage or harm anything or anyone within SCP-7914-2 without proper authorization. Past attempts to do so have consistently failed, often leading to the perpetrator&#39;s termination.



**Description:** SCP-7914 is a town located in Louisiana. SCP-7914-2 cannot be accessed by any other means except SCP-7914-1, a tour bus with no branding or company. SCP-7914 is approximately 320 kilometers away from the city of New Orleans. SCP-7914-2 is identical to New Orleans in geographical layout and architecture, but its anomaly comes from differences in cultural aspects.

The inhabitants of SCP-7914-2, referred to as SCP-7914-3, are humanoid entities nearly indistinguishable from regular humans in appearance. However, they embody extreme stereotypes about New Orleans, often perpetuated in media and by people unfamiliar with the actual city&#39;s culture. This includes such stereotypes as extreme indulgence in voodoo practices, consistent participation in Mardi Gras-esque parades every weekend, and a diet exclusively consisting of gumbo and beignets, and red beans exclusively on Monday.

SCP-7914-3 entity interaction with visitors is generally peaceful if visitors comply with SCP-7914&#39;s cultural norms. However, refusal or incapability to participate in SCP-7914-3 customs results in SCP-7914-3 becoming increasingly hostile. Multiple reports have documented violent behavior from SCP-7914-3 entities, leading to the use of subjects as sacrifices, by █████████.

The origins and purpose of SCP-7914 are currently unknown. Attempts to communicate with SCP-7914-3 entities regarding the history or birthing process of the town result in violent and non-coherent responses.

**Discovery**: SCP-7914-1 was discovered on November 8th, 1994, following multiple reports of a peculiar tour bus and an increasing number of missing person cases that appeared to be linked to the same sighting. A Mobile Task Force designated NO-6 &#34;Parade Masquerade&#34;, assumed the role of tourists and infiltrated the tour bus. Except for one squad member who was sacrificed in a voodoo ceremony, no other incidents occurred. Once SCP-7914 was closed off to the public, authorities used a large sinkhole as a cover-up. Historical records of SCP-7914 date back to approximately 1831, coinciding with the completion and implementation of the Railcar system throughout the city.

**Incident-Report-7914-B1:**

On 12/08/1992, a group of Foundation personnel entered SCP-7914-2 to conduct a communication test. Agent Smith refused to participate in a ritualistic &#39;voodoo&#39; ceremony. SCP-7914-3 entities turned hostile and removed Agent Smith&#39;s eyeballs by [Redacted]. Agent Smith was retrieved with severe physical and mental trauma. All necessary personnel extraction measures were taken.

&gt; Note from Doctor Esper:
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;It is evident that SCP-7914-2 is not a suitable environment for individuals who do not adhere to its cultural practices. Understanding and respecting the current culture, no matter how incorrect or exaggerated it may seem, is essential for maintaining peace and ensuring safety within SCP-7914.&#34;

++++ Tourism within SCP-7914-2
 Despite the potential dangers associated with SCP-7914, this program was established to gather additional information about the function and history of SCP-7914. Additionally, it aims to explore possible means of terminating SCP-7914-1 or SCP-7914-2 itself, if the need for such action arises. 

 A native SCP-7914-3 entity, named Gary Kuhn, primarily serves as a tour guide for authorized personnel visiting SCP-7914. Kuhn, a Caucasian male in his 40s with a well-groomed beard, is one of the friendlier SCP-7914-3 entities. It appears to have a good understanding of the Foundation&#39;s role and the anomaly of his home. Despite its anomalous nature, Kuhn displays a remarkably human demeanor. It has a quick wit and a compulsion to tell exaggerated stories of local folklore and legends, often involving voodoo and Mardi Gras.

 Kuhn also fits the stereotype of a Southern gentleman, as evidenced by his warm hospitality and list of recipes for gumbo and beignets. However, Kuhn exhibits intolerance and demonstrates potential hostility towards individuals who refuse to conform to the cultural customs of SCP-7914. Its reaction to such refusal ranges from quiet disapproval to more extreme forms of disapproval, such as public humiliation or, in severe cases, rallying other SCP-7914-3 entities against the person deemed as &#34;offending.&#34; 

Additionally, it mentions a child named Austin, who was confirmed to be a missing person&#39;s case from 1892. Though physical descriptions are varied and do match the subject. Leading the Foundation to believe it is a fake. Further investigation revealed the existence of a tour guide named Gary Kuhn residing in New Orleans. When questioned, he appeared delirious and repeatedly inquired about the whereabouts of his son. He claimed only recalling a version of himself that appeared zombie-like abducting his child. It is reasonable to assume that this &#34;zombie&#34; is the Gary Kuhn connected to SCP-7914. Further investigation into any more duplicates has been conducted, and no such instance has been found. 

&gt; Note: &#34;Gary Kuhn is our best avenue for peaceful interaction within SCP-7914. Still, spend time understanding his peculiar cultural norms and expectations. A pissed-off Gary is not something to be taken lightly.&#34;

++++ Interview with Austin Kuhn
----

**Date:** [REDACTED]

**Interviewer:** Dr. Esper

**Subject:** Austin Kuhn
----
[BEGIN LOG]

Dr. Esper: Good afternoon, Austin. Thank you for agreeing to speak with me today. I understand you have some information regarding the origins of SCP-7914. Is that correct?

Austin: Yeah, sure thing. Happy to help. It&#39;s been a while since anyone asked me about this stuff.

Dr. Esper: Excellent. Now, can you please describe to me how you got trapped in SCP-7914

Austin: Well, back in the late 1800s, my father, Gary Kuhn, was a tour guide in New Orleans. He was always away from home and I just wanted to see him again, at least not at the late hours of the night.

Dr. Esper: Please continue.

Austin: It was during Mardi Gras, of course. I loved that time of year, always participating in the parades and festivities. But on that fateful day, I encountered a mysterious woman dressed in elaborate voodoo attire. She seemed... otherworldly, you know?

Dr. Esper: Could you provide a physical description of this woman?

Austin: She had long, flowing black hair and eyes that seemed to glow with an unnatural light. Her skin was pale as moonlight, and she wore a dress made of countless feathers. Oh, and she had this necklace with a strange symbol on it, like a twisted serpent.

Dr. Esper: Fascinating. And what happened when you  interacted with her?

Austin: She offered me a small vial, claiming it contained a potion to enhance my connection with my father. Without thinking much, my I drank it down. But that&#39;s when things took a turn for the bizarre. The woman vanished into thin air, and a dense fog enveloped the entire city. When it finally cleared, everything was different.

Dr. Esper: Different in what way?

Austin: Well, New Orleans had transformed It seemed like my city, but not mine at all. Suddenly, my father, along with everyone else, became trapped in this twisted version of the city.

Dr. Esper: And how did your father, now an SCP-7914-1 entity, react to this?

Austin: It took a toll on him, as you can imagine. He lost all sense of self, becoming a mere reflection of those exaggerated stereotypes, just like everyone else. He began obsessively trying to recreate the parades and rituals, but it was never enough. He was trapped, forever lost in this distorted version of his beloved city.

Dr. Esper: That must have been incredibly difficult for him. Did he ever mention anything about voodoo or Mardi Gras playing a role in this transformation?

Austin: I really don&#39;t know I’m sorry mam.

Dr. Esper: And do you believe this curse is connected to the sacrifices and hostility experienced within SCP-7914?

Austin: I&#39;d say it&#39;s almost certain.

Dr. Esper: Thank you, Austin. Your insight has been invaluable in understanding SCP-7914. We will continue our research to find a way to reverse the anomaly and restore the town to its original state.

Note: Upon further investigation Austin is a SCP 7914-3 instance, and must be questioned further. It has seemed to disappear into the city.

**Addendum 7914-C**:

**Investigation into Gary Kuhn&#39;s Role Within SCP-7914**

Following the insightful interview with Austin Kuhn, it became imperative to delve deeper into the role of Gary Kuhn, the SCP-7914-3 entity and tour guide, within SCP-7914. As Dr. Esper shared, Gary Kuhn holds valuable information and serves as a key connection to further understanding the anomaly.

During subsequent interactions with Gary Kuhn, several peculiarities were observed. Although he continued to display warmth and hospitality, his demeanor appeared increasingly calculated and deliberate. Additionally, Kuhn began avoiding certain topics or abruptly changing the subject when questioned about the rituals and transformation processes within SCP-7914.

One particular incident occurred when a Foundation agent attempted to engage Kuhn in a conversation about voodoo practices. At first, Gary seemed eager to share his knowledge, but as the conversation delved deeper, his expression grew tense, and beads of perspiration formed on his forehead. Suddenly, he excused himself under the pretense of needing to check on a parade arrangement and left in a hurry.

This incident raised suspicions regarding Gary Kuhn&#39;s true involvement within SCP-7914. It is possible that his role extends beyond that of a mere tour guide, potentially holding key information about the curse and the underlying cause of the transformation.

Further investigations into Kuhn&#39;s personal history have revealed conflicting evidence. While records indicate that a tour guide named Gary Kuhn operated in New Orleans during the 19th century, no concrete evidence links him to SCP-7914. It is important to note that these records may have been tampered with to further conceal the true nature of SCP-7914 and its origins.

In attempts to locate the missing SCP-7914-3 instance, Austin Kuhn, several search parties have been dispatched within SCP-7914-2. However, no substantial leads or discernible traces of Austin&#39;s whereabouts have been found thus far. It is noteworthy that SCP-7914-2 presents an environment that can disorient and manipulate individuals, possibly contributing to Austin&#39;s evasiveness.

As investigations continue, it is vitally important to approach Gary Kuhn with caution. While he serves as a potential ally for peaceful interaction, it is clear that he is hiding something significant. Maintaining a delicate balance between gaining his trust and ascertaining the truth behind SCP-7914&#39;s curse is crucial to further understanding and resolving the anomaly.
