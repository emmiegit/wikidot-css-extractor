**BZZZZT.**

&#34;Come on, you tossers! Get to the wall!&#34;

A curious slapping-clapping noise: twenty pairs of running shoes smacking into a gym floor, over and over.

**BZZZZT.**

Twenty hands touching a wall, briefly.

Sprinting back to The Line.

**BZZZZT.** &#34;Get it together, Zhengie! We ain&#39;t even started yet!&#34;

Muffled curses. Particularly from Specialist Zheng.

**BZZZZT.**

Later, at breakfast, it occurred again to Jane Weiss how unprepared she&#39;d been for Mobile Task Force physical training.

Obviously, MTFs trained a lot. Everyone knew that, right? They had to. Weiss just hadn&#39;t realized, at first, that //so much of it would involve working out.//

She said as much to Alex Petrosyan, who had joined Theta-90 from Site Security and was sent on almost every single Task Force deployment. They grinned, and asked what sort of PT Weiss had done in her old role.

&#34;Uh... none, really. Nothing official.&#34; Weiss shrugged.

&#34;But weren&#39;t you in Containment before you came here?&#34;

&#34;Yeah. So?&#34;

Petrosyan&#39;s grin widened. &#34;Then how&#39;d you train to run away from all them skips you let out?&#34;

&#34;Oh, you know, uh...&#34; Weiss assumed an expression of exaggerated thought. &#34;Like this.&#34;

Two middle fingers appeared before Petrosyan&#39;s face.

They laughed uproariously. &#34;That&#39;s some good trainin&#39;, right there! That shit work on Keters, or just Safes?&#34;

&#34;That depends,&#34; said Weiss, picking up her cold toast, &#34;on the skip.&#34;


----


Contrary to what she&#39;d been told when she joined, it seemed to Weiss that Mobile Task Force Theta-90 was sent on a lot of deployments. A lot of deployments, more pointedly, that //she// didn&#39;t get to go on. She&#39;d been a member of Theta-90 for almost two years, and hadn&#39;t been deployed once.

&#34;This is starting to piss me off, Smithie,&#34; she&#39;d said during the next morning&#39;s run, straining slightly to catch her breath. &#34;Are - sorry - are they ever gonna send me out, or...?&#34;

Jason Smithson smiled slightly and shook his head, easily keeping pace with Weiss as he talked. &#34;No sense worryin&#39; about it, mate. All them lot&#34; - Smithson waved a hand vaguely upwards as he ran - &#34;decide who goes out and who stays in. We just do what we&#39;re told. Besides.&#34; His smile vanished. &#34;You&#39;re probably best off back here at the minute. Given what the last few run-outs have been like, an&#39; that.&#34;

Silence fell between the runners. Weiss knew what she wanted to say, but didn&#39;t. She knew it was childish. She knew it&#39;d make her sound like a stupid rookie. So, as they crested the next in a seemingly endless series of hills, she very pointedly didn&#39;t say it.

&#34;But I&#39;m not a reeeal Angle Grinder if I&#39;ve not been sent oooouut! Boo-hoo-hoooo!&#34;

Weiss jerked her head sharply around, almost losing her balance on the rocky slope. Smithson was right behind her, pulling a face.

&#34;I know that&#39;s what you&#39;re thinkin&#39;, girl, so stop pretendin&#39;. Fact is, you need to get all that shite out of your head. And I mean //proper// out of it. You&#39;re not more of a Grinder just &#39;cause you&#39;ve been sent out loads of times. Fuckin&#39; hell, look at me! I&#39;m still stuck on Trooper and I&#39;ve been out a few too many times for my liking, I&#39;ll tell you!&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s not about promotion, though, Smithie. You know it&#39;s not.&#34;

Smithson&#39;s expression softened slightly. &#34;I know, mate. But it&#39;s like we said back in the old lot. You can only take on what they put in front of ya. You ain&#39;t any less of a Grinder just &#39;cause we ain&#39;t had to use your skill set yet. Bang!&#34; Leaping over an old river bed, Smithson easily landed where Weiss had stumbled a moment before. &#34;There&#39;s just not been that much this last year that was gonna be difficult to contain. It&#39;s either been dead easy to deal with, or... the other.&#34;

Smithson lapsed into silence, his mind somewhere else, running on autopilot. Weiss knew better than to ask more questions.

&#34;You wanted to see me, sir?&#34;

Paul Dimaccio looked up from his paperwork. &#34;Come in, Weiss. Close the door.&#34; He gestured at an empty seat. &#34;Do you know why you&#39;re here?&#34;

Weiss sat. &#34;Uh... no, sir. I don&#39;t. Is there a problem?&#34;

&#34;No, Weiss, there&#39;s not. At least, not with you.&#34; Dimaccio looked down, briefly, then back to Weiss. &#34;You&#39;re buddies with Alex Petrosyan, right?&#34;

&#34;Uh... yes, sir. I mean, we... we talk some.&#34; Weiss swallowed. &#34;You know,&#34; she finished lamely.

&#34;Yeah.&#34; Dimaccio frowned. &#34;I know a lot of things, Specialist. Like how we ain&#39;t supposed to... //fraternize,// with members of our own Task Force.&#34;

&#34;...Yes, sir.&#34; Weiss flushed slightly, but didn&#39;t look away.

Dimaccio held Weiss&#39; gaze for a few more seconds. Abruptly, he sighed, looked down and rubbed his brows.

&#34;That ain&#39;t why you&#39;re here. I wish it was.&#34; A pause. &#34;Weiss, I&#39;ve gotta tell you that Trooper Petrosyan was found dead in their room at 0800 this morning. Evidence suggests nobody else was involved.&#34;

Weiss opened her mouth. Nothing came out.

Dimaccio looked back up at her, something indefinable in his eyes. &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;

Weiss swallowed. &#34;They... how did...&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m not gonna tell you that, Weiss. It&#39;s not gonna make you feel any better and it&#39;s not gonna help anything. And before you ask, we didn&#39;t see it comin&#39;.&#34; Theta-90&#39;s commander shook his head. &#34;Medical staff, chain of command, not even their own team-mates... not one single person saw this comin&#39;. We shoulda, though.&#34; Dimaccio&#39;s jaw set. &#34;//I// shoulda. Petrosyan went out more times than almost anyone, and some of the shit they&#39;d seen in the last year...&#34;

Dimaccio fell silent for a few seconds. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Weiss.&#34;

Weiss felt strangely faint, now, like Dimaccio&#39;s words were coming to her from far, far away. Somehow, she heard herself asking if Alex had left a note.

Wordlessly, Dimaccio passed her a piece of paper. She unfolded it. It contained three words.

//Tired of running.//
