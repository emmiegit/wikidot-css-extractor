&gt; Life without a name
&gt; Perhaps you should be its friend
&gt; Life returns to death

&gt; Afloat in a lake
&gt; Monsters come in from the fog
&gt; So it floats in peace

&gt; Black White Yellow Red
&gt; The Hanged King above it all
&gt; Black White Yellow Red

&gt; Hate sealed in acid
&gt; Kill it as soon as we can
&gt; We are disgusting

&gt; All things are unclean
&gt; Pure water washes away
&gt; The world that we know

&gt; Visions of five sides,
&gt; Coven of mushroom eaters.
&gt; Can you trust your past?

&gt; Weapon of Vishnu
&gt; Chimpanzee in a trench coat
&gt; Gift from Lord Shiva

&gt; The room smells like shit
&gt; A neck snaps where no-one sees
&gt; Rain at Site-19

&gt; When a toilet says
&gt; Believe me, I&#39;ve seen some shit
&gt; You should lock it up

&gt; Keep it a legend.
&gt; The burned one soars overhead.
&gt; What&#39;s your sacrifice?

&gt; Portrait of a man
&gt; We all die cold and alone
&gt; Forever in paint

&gt; A cold and grey death
&gt; Don&#39;t look too long or we&#39;ll see
&gt; A portrait of you

&gt; A city in song
&gt; The one that never belonged
&gt; We can help her heal

&gt; I&#39;ll speak not of it
&gt; Some forest; names are not safe
&gt; This is just karma

&gt; In the storm, she digs
&gt; Mother&#39;s love lasts forever
&gt; Now, then, we can rest

&gt; Lavender and death.
&gt; Does this doctor know what&#39;s best?
&gt; Were you ever well?

&gt; Friends from childhood
&gt; It&#39;s a small world after all
&gt; Careful what you read

&gt; A world of green dreams
&gt; You can expect a fair deal
&gt; Come back anytime

&gt; Two halves of the same
&gt; Look at all the friends I&#39;ve made
&gt; Purpose forsaken

&gt; The primeval king
&gt; strikes a bargain for mankind
&gt; &#39;till the black moon howls.

&gt; The first of many
&gt; Florida saves all the Earth
&gt; While he walks through walls

&gt; He played Elrond, right?
&gt; Why is he playing Kane&#39;s sled?
&gt; I want a refund!

&gt; To create greatness,
&gt; An artist must suffer well.
&gt; Gladly I endure.

&gt; This here is horse shit
&gt; And I can&#39;t stop eating it
&gt; Happy notdeath day

&gt; Once in a blue moon,
&gt; The world is in agreement.
&gt; The blue moon screeches

&gt; All life becomes death.
&gt; Green flourishes a farewell,
&gt; And then it doesn&#39;t.

&gt; I don&#39;t remember
&gt; what I was writing about
&gt; so I guess I&#39;ll stop

&gt; I&#39;ll do this later</textarea></pre>
