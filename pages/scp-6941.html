**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-6941 is monitored by MTF Iota-65 (“Classic Chasers”) at all times. Any incident involving SCP-6941 must be documented in the database of Site-612[[footnote]]Foundation site in Malaysia.[[/footnote]]. If SCP-6941 demanifests or displays any abnormal behaviour, MTF Iota-65 must find and report its new location as soon as possible. 

After the first interview with SCP-6941-A (See Addendum 04), per the joint decision of Site-612 director, Yusuf Hukum and Site-612 Ethics Committee Representative, Sun Ling, containment efforts of SCP-6941 focus on suppressing public knowledge of SCP-6941. The current goal of the amnestic treatment is to erase memories related to the encounter with SCP-6941 instead of the memories restored by the effects of SCP-6941-B.

All available samples of SCP-6941-B are stored in Anomalous Object Storage Locker 17 in Site-612. Level 2 or higher researchers are allowed to access no more than 5 instances of SCP-6941-B at once for testing purposes. No Foundation personnel are allowed to consume an SCP-6941-B instance except for approved testing. Any civilian who consumed an SCP-6941-B instance specifically produced for them must be detained for questioning and released after targeted amnestic treatment.

Once per week, one member of MTF Iota-65 or Level 2 or higher researcher is allowed to interview SCP-6941-A under the approval of Site-612 director to obtain more information on the anomaly, especially on the possibility of SCP-6941 remanifesting at a new location soon. As SCP-6941-A possesses valuable information about SCP-6941 and maintains a certain level of control over the anomalous location, the Foundation aims to maintain a good relationship with SCP-6941-A. Personnel interacting with SCP-6941-A are instructed to utilize polite and concise language. 

**Description:**

SCP-6941 is an anomalous building resembling a small double-storey grocery store with general architecture style of Malaysian shops between year 1950 and 1970. A wooden sign is hung on top of SCP-6941’s main entrance, with the word “Memories” engraved onto its surface in three different languages: Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. The external dimension of SCP-6941 is 8m x 10m x 14m, but it contains a spatial anomaly which allows the building to store more objects than physically possible. 

SCP-6941 has one front entrance and one back exit. A cashier counter is located on the right side of SCP-6941’s front entrance, where SCP-6941-A is usually seated. Two metal racks are located on the left side of SCP-6941’s front entrance, displaying a variety of food products. Most of the product shelves inside the building are visually obstructed. A rusted iron chain was hung across both the front entrance and back exit of SCP-6941. Any subject which attempts to access the interior sections of SCP-6941 behind the iron chains will be teleported to the furthest entrance of the building, except SCP-6941-A. Any subject which attempts to damage or remove any component of SCP-6941 will be teleported to a random location 10m away from the building. Any stolen product from SCP-6941 will be teleported back to its original location.

All identifiable products in SCP-6941 are from Malaysian brands popular between year 1950 and 1970, which some are no longer available in the present day. However, all products from SCP-6941 are always in a pristine condition, often having a viable expiry date. All products within SCP-6941 are sold at a price matching the local currency and inflation rate between year 1950 and 1970. 

SCP-6941-A is a male humanoid entity of Asian descent, with the visual age of 80 years old. The attire of SCP-6941-A varies between observers, portraying the traditional costume of the observer’s ethnicity. This effect also applies to printed or digital media featuring SCP-6941-A. SCP-6941-A possesses linguopathic[[footnote]]The anomalous ability to read, write and speak any language fluently with no prior knowledge.[[/footnote]] capabilities, and is hypothesized to possess Class-2 reality altering capabilities. SCP-6941-A remains within SCP-6941 at all times, claiming to be unable to leave. SCP-6941-A displays friendly  behaviour when interacting with any living subject who enters SCP-6941, often referring to them as “customers” or “fellow wanderers”. However, SCP-6941-A refuses to accept any requests for products stored within the internal sections of SCP-6941. SCP-6941-A expresses slight displeasure when a subject makes multiple attempts to trespass SCP-6941’s sections behind the iron chains, but the entity does not display any form of hostility.

SCP-6941-B is the collective designation for food products with anomalous mnestic effects, each provided to a specific subject by SCP-6941-A. An SCP-6941-B instance can only be obtained through the Memorium Process, which occurs when a human subject establishes direct contact with SCP-6941 without a prior successful Memorium Process. 

The Memorium Process begins when a viable subject enters SCP-6941. SCP-6941-A will greet the subject using the subject’s native language and ask if the subject is looking for something they miss. SCP-6941 will then induce a strong memetic effect, causing the subject to experience an overwhelming emotional sensation of nostalgia. The subject will be compelled to inform SCP-6941-A of one lost or faded memory which they wish to recover the most. SCP-6941-A will ask the subject to wait, then enter the internal section of SCP-6941. After a period of time between 30 seconds to 5 minutes, SCP-6941-A will re-emerge with one SCP-6941-B instance. The true source of SCP-6941-B instances is currently unknown. SCP-6941-A will then offer to sell the SCP-6941-B instance to the subject. The Memorium Process concludes after the subject completes the purchase.

Experiments have proved that subjects with Level 4 or higher memetic resistance are able to withstand the influence of SCP-6941 and refuse to answer the question of SCP-6941-A during a Memorium Process. SCP-6941-A expresses slight disappointment upon receiving this reaction, but the entity does not perform further actions.

Each SCP-6941-B instance is identical to the intended subject’s most preferred snack from their childhood or teenage period, even if the original brand or product line never survived to the present day. Unlike the non-anomalous products in SCP-6941, SCP-6941-B instances can be from brands in other countries. If a subject consumes an instance of SCP-6941-B specifically provided to them by SCP-6941-A, the subject will be able to recall the previously forgotten event, person, object, or location they mentioned during the Memorium Process with extremely high clarity. However, subjects consuming SCP-6941-B instances not specifically provided to them by SCP-6941-A do not experience similar effects.

Experiments have proved that SCP-6941-B instances are able to fully restore memory fragments affected by natural deterioration, disease and even amnestics. Detailed analysis of the composition of SCP-6941-B instances showed no indications on how consuming them can achieve such effect. 

After a time between 7 days and 8 months, SCP-6941 will remanifest in a new location within a 100km radius of its previous location. SCP-6941 constantly induces a memetic effect which convinces anyone within its 15m radius that its presence is natural and part of the local history. SCP-6941 is known to manifest more frequently near small towns with historical preserves. SCP-6941 is currently located in Georgetown, Malaysia.

**Addendum 01: Discovery**

[[collapsible]]

In 03/2006, the web crawler software developed by Site-612, SITI, detected multiple posts and threads on various social media platforms discussing an anomalous shop in Malaysia, which allows people to regain lost memories of important moments. The anomalous shop also sparked vigorous arguments online between witnesses as they all claimed that the shop had always existed in their own hometown, suggesting possible memetic influence. 

On 03/04/2006, [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#lambda-14 MTF Lambda-14 (“One Star Reviewers&#34;)] was dispatched to investigate the anomalous shop, successfully locating it in Batu Pahat, Malaysia. A human test subject, D-3328, was provided to conduct a precautionary exploration.

Equipped with audio and video relay devices, D-3328 was instructed to enter the anomalous shop. However, D-3328 stopped 5 meters away from the shop’s main entrance, appearing to be in confusion. When MTF Lambda-14 questioned D-3328, he explained that he experienced a strange sensation of familiarity towards the shop’s existence, as if he visited it sometime in the past. 

As instructed, D-3328 continued to enter the shop and was greeted politely by an elderly Asian man behind the cashier counter using Polish. D-3328 expressed his surprise that the man spoke his native language. The man proceeded to ask D-3328 if he was looking for something he missed. Despite being given the order to wait, D-3328 replied immediately that he wished he could remember his mother’s face again, since she passed away when he was 4 years old and left no photographs behind as a result of their poverty and lack of citizenship. The elderly man politely asked D-3328 to wait and retreated to the product storage section, re-emerging with a piece of nougat candy in its hand after 3 minutes. The man offered to sell D-3328 the candy at a price of 0.05 Polish złoty. D-3328 pleaded for funds to buy the candy, explaining that he felt it was “extremely important”. The request was approved by Site-612 director. After the purchase was completed, MTF Lambda-14 secured D-3328 and confiscated the candy before he could consume it.

After securing D-3328, MTF Lambda-14 mobilized to investigate the anomalous shop. 4 out of the 15 agents reported a strong mental tendency to normalize the shop’s existence, despite the entire team being equipped with anti-memetic gear. MTF Lambda-14 soon discovered that the Asian man is an anomalous entity, as its attire varied between observers. As 2 agents drew their weapons and warned the entity to cooperate, the entity simply raised both hands and smiled. As the remaining agents went beyond the iron chains across the front entrance, they were immediately teleported to the back exit. Another entry attempt from the back exit produced the same result. 

MTF Lambda-14 questioned the entity about this phenomenon, and the entity simply replied: “Those are sacred grounds, my fellow wanderers. I was allowed to enter only to perform my duty. Even I don’t know how much memory it could hold.” When the agents attempted to apprehend the entity, the entity expressed its disappointment and said: “They will not like what you are doing, wanderers.” The anomalous shop demanifested right after, leaving no traces behind.

After MTF Lambda-14 submitted their mission report, the anomalous shop was officially designated as SCP-6941. The anomalous humanoid entity and the candy purchased from the shop were designated as SCP-6941-A and SCP-6941-B respectively, as experiments to investigate their true nature began. As investigation revealed no connections between SCP-6941 and retail-oriented GoIs, MTF Iota-65 (“Classic Chasers”) was formed to handle SCP-6941 and lighten the workload of MTF Lambda-14.

**Addendum 02: SCP-6941 Experiment Log 2**

[[collapsible]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Item #:** SCP-6941
**Experiment #:** 2
**Location:** Humanoid Testing Chamber 18, Site-612
**Person in Charge:** Dr. Frederick Wilson (Level 3 Researcher)
**Subject:** D-3328
**Foreword:**
D-3328 is confirmed as the first subject to successfully undergo the Memorium Process under Foundation supervision. This experiment is to investigate the possible effects on a human subject after consuming an SCP-6941-B instance.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

D-3328 was instructed to consume the SCP-6941-B instance provided to him by SCP-6941-A. The body language of D-3328 indicates excitement and willingness upon hearing the request. 10 seconds after ingesting the inner content of SCP-6941-B, D-3328 entered a confused emotional state between grief and joy, crying uncontrollably. When inquired by Dr. Wilson, D-3328 explained that he was able to clearly remember his mother’s face again, despite the memory having undergone 28 years of natural deterioration. 

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** 
Testing results showed that both the inner content and external wrapping of the SCP-6941-B instance contained no known mnestic compounds or abnormal substances. It was concluded that SCP-6941-B instances possess anomalous mnestic properties. Further testing to investigate SCP-6941-B’s effects on different subjects are necessary.

**Addendum 03: SCP-6941 Experiment Log 7**

[[collapsible]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Item #:** SCP-6941
**Experiment #:** 7
**Location:** SCP-6941, Currently manifested in Seremban, Malaysia
**Person in Charge:** Dr. Nurianti Aman (Level 3 Researcher)
**Subject:** D-6123
**Foreword:**
This experiment is to investigate the effects of SCP-6941-B instance on human memories affected by amnestics.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

D-6123 was given targeted amnestic treatment to remove memories related to the last words of her late friend, Anthony, who died in a traffic accident which she was the sole witness. D-6123 displayed violent behaviour towards Dr. Aman, but agreed to cooperate after a disciplinary warning from MTF Iota-65 (“Classic Chasers”).

Equipped with audio and video relay devices, D-6123 was instructed to enter SCP-6941 and conduct the Memorium Process. D-6123 complied, remarking that the building “gave her weird childhood vibes”. During the Memorium Process, SCP-6941-A conversed with D-6123 in English. The Memorium Process successfully ended after D-6123 purchased the resulting SCP-6941-B instance at the price of 0.2 USD. D-6123 was then instructed to consume the SCP-6941-B instance, who remarked that it tasted exactly like the corn chips she liked as a child. 

30 seconds after ingesting the inner contents of the SCP-6941-B instance, D-6123 exclaimed that she was able to remember the last words of Anthony again. SCP-6941-A expressed its satisfaction by smiling and bowing to D-6123. D-6123 gestured her right middle finger at her head-mounted camera, claiming that she will “forgive Dr. Aman just this once” and “kill her next time”. MTF Iota-65 immediately intervened to secure D-6123 in a transport vehicle, returning her to Site-612.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:**
It was concluded that the anomalous mnestic properties of SCP-6941-B is able to restore human memories affected by amnestics. Further testing to investigate the relationship between SCP-6941-A and SCP-6941-B, as well as possible applications of SCP-6941-B in Foundation operations are necessary.

Note from Dr. Nurianti Aman:
We really need to look into whether -B can restore memories removed by anomalous means.

**Addendum 04: SCP-6941-A Interview Log**

[[collapsible]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Interviewed:** SCP-6941-A
**Interviewer:** Dr. Connie Liu (Level 3 Researcher with Level 3 Memetic Resistance)
**Foreword:**
Dr. Connie Liu submitted a request to interview SCP-6941-A. The request was approved by Site-612 director, Yusuf Hukum. Dr. Connie Liu was provided with anti-memetic gear to counter the anomalous influence of SCP-6941. The interview was successfully conducted on 28/06/2006.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

[The following conversation between Dr. Connie Liu and SCP-6941-A is translated from Mandarin]

**SCP-6941-A:** Welcome, welcome! You are my first customer of the day. Looking for something you miss?

**Dr. Connie Liu:** Greetings. (Silent for 5 seconds) Sorry, I’m afraid I’m not.

**SCP-6941-A:** (Sigh) Well, it’s alright. You can always come back if you feel like remembering. Take a look around! You can always get yourself a good local treat.

**Dr. Connie Liu:** Excuse me, but I’m not just here to buy some snacks. I’m here because people talked about this place, how it has some really old snacks and “magic”. I have some very important questions to ask you, S – How do I call you, mister?

**SCP-6941-A:** SCP-6941-A? You can call me that if you want. I’m actually glad to have some kind of new designation, except it’s too formal for my tastes. I lost the right to my name a long time ago. And, yes. Of course you would try to ask questions. You’re from the…Foundation. Its insignia is hanging above the heads of many recent customers.

**Dr. Connie Liu:** (Silent for 5 seconds) How did you know about the Foundation?

**SCP-6941-A:** Apologies, lady. I only make small talks with my customers. I’m used to people having ulterior motives when they come to me, and I try my best to make them comfortable, but there are some principles which I need to adhere to. Please don’t take this personally.

**Dr. Connie Liu:** What do I have to do to be considered a customer, then?

**SCP-6941-A:** (Smiles widely) Buy yourself a snack.

**Dr. Connie Liu:** (Silent for 10 seconds, then gestures towards one of the glass jars in front of SCP-6941-A) …One sour plum malt candy, please.

**SCP-6941-A:** Right away! (Opens the glass jar and retrieves one piece of candy) That’ll be 0.05 MYR.

**Dr. Connie Liu:** (Makes payment) Here. Do you actually make meaningful profit from selling these products?

**SCP-6941-A:** (Stores received payment in a drawer) In some other form, yes. I use them to pay my debt.

**Dr. Connie Liu:** What kind of debt?

**SCP-6941-A:** I am more than happy to tell you my story, lady, but please be aware that there’s only so much that I’m allowed to tell. They believe it is better to leave some room for human effort and…imagination.

**Dr. Connie Liu:** Who are “they” that you’re referring to? Are they some form of ontokinetic entity?

**SCP-6941-A:** They are the mountain sisters[[footnote]]Possibly related to the Malaysian legend of Gunung Santubong and Gunung Sejinjang.[[/footnote]], lady. Princesses from the heavens, older than you and me, older than that Foundation of yours. They watch over the people of Borneo, especially those who have ties with the land’s very lifeline. I’m afraid you’ll have to figure out the rest on your own.

**Dr. Connie Liu:** Acknowledged. How are these entities you mentioned related to the anomalous abilities of both you and this shop? Do they give you these powers, or are they your own?

**SCP-6941-A:** As eager for knowledge as before, eh? Well, as long as someone might learn a lesson or two from it. This shop is wonderful, yes, but the sisters gave it to me as a mere punishment.

**Dr. Connie Liu:** A punishment?

**SCP-6941-A:** (Clears throat) You see, I was a bomoh[[footnote]]Malay shaman and traditional medicine practitioner.[[/footnote]]. I was born with eyes to see spirits and hands to hold impossible things. People came to me for guidance and salvation, making various offerings in exchange. Some came with malevolent motives: to harm, deceive, or steal from others, but I realized that they were the ones making the most generous offerings. Gold, gems, silk, land, noble titles...

**SCP-6941-A:** I was too proud of my gifts, not to mention my skills in magic. Instead of waiting for others to come, I decided to make them come begging from me instead. (Sigh) I stole their most precious things: riches, power, family heirloom, children, memories…you would be surprised how much people were willing to sacrifice to get memories of their late mother back. (Silent for 5 seconds) Forgive me, lady, I didn’t mean to remind you of that.

**Dr. Connie Liu:** It’s alright. Please proceed, SCP-6941-A.

**SCP-6941-A:** As you wish, dear customer. Well, it all went down when I stole from the sacred villages[[footnote]]Kampung Pasir Kuning and Kampung Pasir Putih, closely related to the Gunung Santubong and Gunung Sejinjang legend.[[/footnote]]. Oh, the sisters were furious, and their wrath crushed me like the mountains they were sealed in. My tiny gifts from the land’s lifeline were nothing compared to its rightful guardians. 

**SCP-6941-A:** I stole the belongings of people who owed me nothing, thus I was stripped of my name. I broke their hearts so badly, thus I was sealed in this shop forever. Well, maybe not forever, but until I restore as many memories as those I had taken. The progress has always been slow, but it is even slower recently. I suppose it has something to do with your Foundation?

**Dr. Connie Liu:** (Revises written notes) Thank you for the information, SCP-6941-A, but the Foundation stands to maintain normalcy and against exposure of anomalies to the public. I’m afraid we might not be able to allow you to resume normal operation.

**SCP-6941-A:** Your Foundation has a noble cause, lady, but there is nothing much that I can do for you. Like I said before, I have to adhere to certain principles, which one of them is keep this shop running. The fear of the unknown drives us to dead ends, but challenging the unknown might also do the same. The sisters are not for you or me to challenge.

**Dr. Connie Liu:** Your concern is appreciated, SCP-6941-A, but I’m afraid we cannot settle down without a proper containment procedure. SCP-6941 is just too –

**SCP-6941-A:** Calm down, lady. I do have a proposal for you, as it also matches the will of the sisters.

**Dr. Connie Liu:** (Silent for 5 seconds) I’m listening.

**SCP-6941-A:** You see, those who are truly in need will be guided by their fate to me, but ever since the invention of, what do you call it – internet, the shop starts to get too crowded. Those who come merely for the sake of coming or proving annoys the sisters. It would be helpful if your Foundation remove those…inconvenient mentions on the internet.

**Dr. Connie Liu:** I’m glad that you agree with our online presence suppression policies, mister, but we cannot risk the spread of information through conversations and prints either.

**SCP-6941-A:** Then don’t let them, Ms. Liu. Stop them from talking about this place. Make them forget about this shop and me. The only thing I ask is to not stop those guided by the land’s lifeline from coming to me. I do not give them anything new, lady – I merely restore what was lost.

**Dr. Connie Liu:** (Silent for 10 seconds) Thank you for your cooperation, SCP-6941-A. I will relay your proposal to my superiors as soon as possible.

**SCP-6941-A:** You’re most welcome, my dear customer. Oh, one small reminder: the shop will move by the end of the day, so please stay clear when that happens. (Sigh) I wish the sisters could tell me where it will be.

**Dr. Connie Liu:** Your reminder is appreciated, SCP-6941-A. (Silent for 3 seconds) Can I have another sour plum malt candy?

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:**
After the interview, Dr. Connie Liu described the attire of SCP-6941-A from her perception as “standard male peasant outfit from the Han dynasty in China”. 6 hours after the interview, SCP-6941 demanifested from its current location. 30 minutes later, SCP-6941 was discovered in Sungai Udang, Malaysia.
