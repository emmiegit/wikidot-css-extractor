&gt; It is almost 1 am. My love is sleeping beside me, resting on my chest. Headlights from trucks rumbling by shine gaps in the curtains, illuminating our shape under blankets. Our fan whines above us. Our cat, asleep on and nuzzling with a big teddy bear. Our family.
&gt; 
&gt; I don’t think I’ve ever been happier.

crumpled paper
&gt; I feel emotions in a bigger way than other people and it’s invalidating for me every time I get told I have to calm down or that I’m making a big deal out of nothing and I feel like you don’t believe my feelings were real when I don’t have an adequate explanation for my reaction. I get treated like I did something wrong or should have been better when I couldn’t have been any other way. When I get treated like a foolish little girl for being my authentic self it hurts my estimation of myself as a person. 
&gt; 
&gt; When I make a mistake and in response the other person immediately shuts down and/or becomes angry and bitter then I feel invalidated. The silent treatment hurts even more so. I want to know why I did wrong. It’s not on purpose. I want to do the right thing and sometimes big feelings lead to big mistakes. All I ask is that communication and empathy not be withdrawn in a seemingly punitive fashion when I do. Blaming and shaming me for things, even things that are my fault, is counter-productive. I know I’m at fault and feel overwhelming anxiety at the prospect of future punishment. Making that point acute is basically saying that I need to go sit in the corner so the actual adults can handle it.
&gt; 
&gt; Repeatedly reminding me of my inadequacy and all the things I’ve failed to do in the past makes it more difficult for me to do things in the future. When you repeatedly point out how I’m failing at the things I’m trying to do and how hard that makes your life, that undermines my confidence. I am really suffering from mental illness which is just as debilitating and just as exhausting as yours. Diminishing my struggle is diminishing yours too. We can understand each other if we accept that each is struggling as much as the other.
