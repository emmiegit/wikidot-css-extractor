-----

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7749 is to be stored on a pedestal inside of a large Keter-class containment chamber at Site-86. This pedestal is not to be placed less than 10m from any side of the chamber. Personnel are not to enter SCP-7749&#39;s containment chamber at any time except for testing. The containment chambers directly above and below SCP-7749&#39;s are to remain unoccupied due to the height restrictions of SCP-7749&#39;s chamber.

As of 20/05/2023, finding a way to neutralize SCP-7749&#39;s anomalous effects or transport it off-site is considered a top level priority.

**Description:** SCP-7749 is a dark-brown 12oz ceramic mug. SCP-7749 contains a light-brown liquid, identified by personnel to be standard coffee. The volume of liquid contained within SCP-7749 has not been seen to change during its time in Foundation custody.

SCP-7749 possesses a multitude of anomalous properties, including but not limited to:
* Visual distortion in a roughly 10m radius around SCP-7749. Observers have reported the surrounding area as appearing &#34;fuzzy&#34; or reminiscent of a low-resolution image.
* Spatial distortion within the same radius. This causes SCP-7749 to appear closer to or further from an observer than it actually is.
* Spontaneous transmutation into various other shapes at random intervals for short periods of time, typically appearing jagged, irregular, and distorted.
* Spontaneous teleportation at random intervals. Distance teleported has not been observed to exceed 10m in any direction.
* General instability of space within the 10m radius. This has resulted in the alteration of objects within the area, often appearing distorted in a similar manner to SCP-7749 during its transformations. Sudden disappearance, acceleration, and teleportation of objects within the area has also been observed.

SCP-7749 was discovered on May 18, 2023 inside a break room in Site-86 Facility 4 by multiple personnel. Upon initial reports of the anomaly, the break room was blocked off and attempts were made to transport the object to a containment chamber. Following multiple unsuccessful attempts to get near SCP-7749, a portable Scranton reality anchor (SRA) was deployed to allow agents to transfer the object into a portable containment locker for transportation, after which it was successfully contained. Both the SRA and the portable containment locker sustained significant alteration by SCP-7749 during the event and were rendered inoperable following containment.

Following the above ping report, an investigation was launched into the incongruity. After faulty equipment was ruled out, SCP-7749, having been discovered at Site-86 the same day the issue began, was determined to be the most probable cause. As such, Dr. Evie Salem-Orden[[footnote]][https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3644 Site-86&#39;s regional head of the Temporal Anomalies Department.][[/footnote]] and Archivist Ryan River[[footnote]]Site-86&#39;s head of archives and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/humint RAISA liaison.][[/footnote]] launched a joint operation to lessen SCP-7749&#39;s temporal impact on Site-86.

++++++ The following is an abridged summary of containment attempts of SCP-7749 as part of the joint operation by Dr. Salem-Orden and Archivist River, May 21, 2023.

-----

**Method:** Installation of several Scranton reality anchors (SRAs) in SCP-7749&#39;s containment chamber.

**Result:** All installed SRAs were spontaneously altered in shape, distorting several critical components into jagged and inconsistent shapes. All units were rendered inoperable.

-----

**Method:** Relocation of SCP-7749 off-site.

**Result:** All agents sent to place SCP-7749 into a portable containment locker were propelled away from the object at high speed. All agents were uninjured but were unsuccessful in getting close to SCP-7749.

-----

**Method:** Installation of a Xyank/Anastasakos Constant Temporal Sink (XACTS) in SCP-7749&#39;s containment chamber.

**Result:** A metal bar (identified as the one used in Experiment Log 20/05/2023) materialized in front of SCP-7749 and was launched at the XACTS at high speed, destroying the unit.

++++++ The following is an abridged summary of containment attempts of SCP-7749 as part of the joint operation by Dr. Salem-Orden and Archivist River, May 23, 2023.

-----

**Method:** Neutralization of SCP-7749 via the detonation of explosive charges.

**Result:** Site-86&#39;s entire Keter containment wing was temporally frozen immediately upon detonation. Over an hour later, the Keter wing was unfrozen, but had moved backward in time three days, leading to confusion among personnel. SCP-7749 was unaffected and the charges were missing upon resumption of temporal flow.

-----

**Method:** Opening of a Way to transport SCP-7749 off-site.

**Result:** A Way was successfully created under SCP-7749, but it did not possess a corresponding emergence point. The area of space within the Way appeared as a solid wall of purple and black-checkered squares that SCP-7749 was unable to pass through.

-----

**Method:** Use of thaumaturgy to teleport SCP-7749 off-site.

**Result:** Attempt failed for an unknown reason. The thaumaturge assigned claimed that the &#34;request timed out&#34;, and refused to further elaborate.

**Dr. Salem-Orden:** Director, this is becoming a problem. An even worse problem than it already is.

**Dir. Joko:** How bad is it?

//[Arch. River produces a printed copy of the PANOPTICON ping report for May 23 and hands it to Dir. Joko.]//

**Dr. Salem-Orden:** Site-86 is now over ten minutes behind the rest of the world.

**Dir. Joko:** All of Site-86?

**Dr. Salem-Orden:** Yes. //All// of Site-86.

**Dir. Joko:** Even the—

**Dr. Salem-Orden:** Even the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6749 external facilities]. For some reason, this problem is exclusive to Site-86. All of the surrounding area is operating normally.

**Dir. Joko:** I&#39;ve seen the security footage. You know this isn&#39;t just a temporal anomaly.

//[Arch. River steps forward.]//

**Arch. River:** Yeah— yes. The, uh, the region of space inhabited by Site-86 has become incredibly hazardous. SCP-7749&#39;s instability is not just limited to its &#34;radius&#34; anymore. I&#39;ve stopped updating the main file at this point because this thing&#39;s parameters keep changing on us.

**Dr. Salem-Orden:** We&#39;re unable to diminish its effects and we&#39;re unable to move it. We&#39;ve tried everything.

**Dir. Joko:** You&#39;ve tried six things.

**Dr. Salem-Orden:** That&#39;s just what&#39;s in the file, Director. Ryan couldn&#39;t include all of them.

**Arch. River:** Sir, if you don&#39;t mind me butting in, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve also noticed the, uh, the other problem that&#39;s been happening.

//[Silence on recording for several seconds.]//

**Dir. Joko:** The...?

//[Arch. River clears his throat.]//

**Arch. River:** Right. Yeah. Site-86&#39;s average temperature over the last week has inexplicably skyrocketed. The entire site is overheating, but no one&#39;s found any ventilation or air conditioning issues.

**Dir. Joko:** I suppose it is hot in here, yeah.

**Arch. River:** It&#39;s going to get worse. If the site&#39;s instability and temperature keep rising at this rate, Site-86 will be uninhabitable by the 25th.

**Dir. Joko:** I&#39;m still not... entirely sure what you want me to do about it. This is your task force.

**Dr. Salem-Orden:** We&#39;re not proposing more experiments, Director. We&#39;re proposing we evacuate the site.

**Afterword:** Following this meeting, Director Joko signed an executive order to evacuate the site of all personnel and anomalies, which would take place over the next two days. All anomalies would be transferred to nearby sites, such as Sites -56 and -45, or to temporary containment outposts. This evacuation would remain in effect until a solution to the SCP-7749 problem was discovered.

**14:52:** //[Asst. Dir. Butler pauses. The agents pause in response. Asst. Dir. Butler does not move for two minutes.]//

**14:54:** //[Asst. Dir. Butler screams. Her entire body becomes near-total black in color. The agents back away in caution.]//

**14:55:** //[Asst. Dir. Butler falls to the ground, continuing to scream. Her body rapidly flickers between near-total black, a pattern of purple and black-checkered squares, and completely vanishing. An agent from the group runs to get help. She is seen slamming her fists into the ground and frantically grabbing at her hair and face as her body begins significantly shaking.]//

**15:13:** //[Asst. Dir. Butler stops screaming. Her body slowly regains its typical form. She remains on the ground, crying and hyperventilating. After two minutes, an agent helps her to her feet and the group hesitantly resumes moving alongside her.]//

**15:31:** //[Arch. River vanishes, reappearing a second later 2m to the left, his body partially clipped into the wall next to him. He begins panicking, trying to escape the wall.]//

**15:34:** //[Arch. River pushes against the wall a final time, successfully passing back through it and freeing himself. Upon being freed, he hovers in the air for a second before falling, passing through the floor and falling through to the floor below. Security cameras on lower floors at this point capture Arch. River falling all the way down the site, passing through all solid objects in his way. He is heard screaming the entire time.]//

**15:34:** //[Cameras in Basement Level 3 capture Arch. River falling through the floor. As BL-3 is the lowest floor of Site-86, Arch. River is assumed lost, as he has not been recovered since.]//
