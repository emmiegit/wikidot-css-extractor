    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** 4567-J: the uneatable potato chip

**Class:** thaumiel

**Appearance:** it just a chip….a normal lays original potato chip

**Special containment procedures:** put in a bowl or plate

**Anomalous effects:** when within 10 feet of scp scp-4567-J triggers the test subject to want to consume it, but when the subject tries to eat it scp-4567 will cause the subject to freeze until the subject is removed from the room

**Termination attempts:** doctor pasquali attempted to nuke scp 4567, it failed resulting in doctor pasquali’s psychotic break

**Containment breach:** THE CHIP FELL ON THE FLOOR!!!

Incident 1: dr pasquali, the lead doctor for scp 4567-J’s case

Log number 1: doctor pasquali here, i have stumbled upon a singular potato chip on the sidewalk, now normally i wouldn’t eat something i find the dirty sidewalk but as soon as i stumbled upon it i just had to eat it, when i attempted to eat 4567-J i froze in place until a random person pushed me out of the way, i knew i had to contain it, so i picked it up with an 11 foot long stick

log 2: doctor pasquali here, im joined by dr slice, he is quite hungry as a stole his lunch at gave to doctor bullock, he was hungry, doctor slice is now in the room and is frozen in place with a look of horror on his face, i had to remove him from the chips presence at once

Log 3: dr pasquali here i decided to expose scp 096 to scp 4567-J as soon as he entered to room he froze in place, he wouldn’t stop screaming, he had to be dragged out of the room

Log 4: dr pasquali hereI exposed scp 106 to scp 4567-J,  at first scp 106 was able to resist scp 4567-J’s effects but eventually succumbed to its power, scp 106 is now dead, he exploded due to the mere power of the chip….

Log 5:  what are your secrets chip…i must know how a small chip is so powerful, TELL ME NOW….sorry i got a little carried away, anyways i must go now the others need me

Log 6: doctor pasqualli here, i must destroy the chip, it is too dangerous, the others call me crazy but they&#39;ll be crawling back to me when they suffer at the hands of the great chip

Log 7: dr pasquali here this will be my final log for a while, after many many attempted terminations i have attached scp 4567-J to nuclear explosives yes i am going to nuke scp 4567-J, if this doesn&#39;t work i don&#39;t know what will

*note from dr slice* “dr” Pasquali&#39;s death was an unfortunate one. There is still no evidence of his doctor&#39;s degree. His death still was tragic.
