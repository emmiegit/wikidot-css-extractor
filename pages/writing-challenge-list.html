This is a list of writing challenges/prompts generated by site members in the [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/c-2077310 Research and Resources forum]. The list was formerly contained in a [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1043838/challenge-threads forum thread], but has been moved here for visibility and tidiness. 

**For a challenge thread to be added here, it must have __either one or both of__ the following:** 
- At least five “I’m interested” or “I’m doing this” comments/posts, from different users. A challenge should be inspirational to authors and encourage discussion!
- At least one successful page on the site that resulted from the challenge. A challenge should produce good work and fun!

Please read the entirety of the challenge thread if you would like to participate in a challenge as an author! The descriptions listed are just small snippets of greater wholes. Happy writing!
