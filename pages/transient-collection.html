[[collapsible show=&#34;+ What is This?&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide&#34;]]
These brief, broken segments of ideas have been my experience with identity. Labels are often too permanent, too constricting, and used for convenience with others to explain something more simply than touching upon the truth of the depths of the self.

It&#39;s confusing, isn&#39;t it? Finding your place in the world? Who you are and to have confidence in that? Then to try and explain that to others? Often, I&#39;ve simply opted not to, letting people perceive me how they wish and going &#34;close enough!&#34; while staying in the shadows myself. But that doesn&#39;t lead to growth, and I&#39;ve always wondered if there have been people out there who struggle with this lack of identity to the same degree I do, which has lead to where we are today - the Transient Collection.

Stringing together these segmented thoughts has been my attempting at exploring my identity, and I share it with you all to maybe, just maybe, help someone else find themselves, or feel that they&#39;re not alone in how complex our souls can be.

Journey with me through memories of life, told through illustrated poetry, and perhaps we&#39;ll learn something new about ourselves together.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ More About the Art Style&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide&#34;]]

I&#39;ve been asked a few times about this style of storytelling and if it has a name or genre, and honestly, I&#39;m not sure!

Generally I think if I were to get more specific, a lot of these pieces are inspired by the Japanese style of visual storytelling. For context, Western comics tend to always be action to action shots (person starts a punch -&gt; punch collides) - it&#39;s the most efficient way to tell a story and be clear about what&#39;s going on. Japanese style comics feature a whole lot more aspect to aspect transitions (a shot of an exterior of a house -&gt; close up of the door frame -&gt; shot looking in the window). They give a sense of wandering through a scene and staying to look around a moment.

While most of Transient&#39;s pieces are single image and don&#39;t feature scene transitions visually, the idea of wandering in a moment in time to capture a very specific feeling is definitely inspired by that idea.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Collaborations and Further Readings&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide&#34;]]
Transient is a personal journey with me exploring myself and my struggles, so Transient itself is a solo series/collection. That being said, I strongly encourage people to use art and writing to explore themselves and figure things out, and would be happy to give pointers on how to do that. 

If looking for other pieces to read on similar themes, I would strongly recommend checking out the works highlighted in [[[caminero | Caminero]]], which is a series hub dedicated to stories exploring what it means to be Latino. It has a lot of powerful pieces, written by some of WL&#39;s most talented authors.
