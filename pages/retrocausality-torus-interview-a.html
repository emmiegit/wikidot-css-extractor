**Foreword:**
@@     @@Following the 2nd trial, Subject was debriefed according to standard operating procedure.
@@     @@Unbeknownst to the subject, passive polygraph testing in effect. Note: Subject emotionally labile and somewhat paranoid. 

----

**Subject:** We&#39;ve been over this and over this...let me get some sleep.

**Interviewer:** //You&#39;ll get it...once your debrief is over.//

**Subject:** What have you done with Dr W██████?

**Interviewer:** //As I keep telling you, there&#39;s no such person. You&#39;ve seen the personnel manifest...do you think I&#39;m trying to mislead you?//

**Subject:** (no reply)

**Interviewer:** //You don&#39;t remember researcher B██████? You&#39;ve worked with him a number of times before. According to him, you&#39;ve developed a degree of friendship...//

**Subject:** I&#39;ve never heard of him. I don&#39;t know who that is.

**Interviewer:** //But you acknowledge that he knows personal details about you. How could he know those things? Like who you dated at University? The name of your sister&#39;s children?//

**Subject:** (tiredly) I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know how.

@@     @@ //10 minute break. Subject allowed a soft drink and a cigarette.//

**Interviewer**: //You&#39;ve indicated that we&#39;re supposed to know ....about...(consults notes).... SCP-████ and SCP-████. According to you, SCP-████ is a [DATA EXPUNGED], capable of [DATA EXPUNGED]. And SCP-████ is supposed to be some sort of precognitive computer?//

**Subject:** Yes. I designed their containment procedures. I&#39;ve been studying SCP-████ for two months when this assignment came up. I&#39;d written up my notes on...

**Interview:** //As you&#39;ve been told, there are no such SCPs. We&#39;ve never heard of them.//

**Subject:** (unintelligible)

**Interviewer:** //What?//

**Subject:** I said &#39;you will&#39;…you&#39;ll hear about them presently. You have field agents in █████████? That&#39;s where we find them.

**Interviewer:** //So you say.//

**Subject:** So I say... do you mind?

**Interviewer:** //Go ahead.//

@@     @@ //Subject allowed another cigarette.//

**Interviewer:** //You said before about the change you used to buy the soda...you didn&#39;t recognize who&#39;s on the dime.//

**Subject:** (tiredly) That&#39;s right.

**Interviewer:** //According to you, who&#39;s supposed to be on the dime?//

**Subject:** FDR.

**Interviewer:** //Yeah, well, that&#39;s who&#39;s on the dime.//

**Subject:** No it&#39;s...it&#39;s not...he&#39;s not in profile. Can&#39;t you remember? It&#39;s famous for being a strange...portrait, picture, whatever. With his characteristic ... leer? You know what I mean.

**Interview:** //I can say I...//

**Subject:** (yelling) Why are you doing this? Is this a psychological .... are you trying to disorient me, see how much it takes to make me...

**Interviewer:** //You know that&#39;s not true.//

**Subject:** (unintelligible)

**Interviewer:** //It may be that the artifact has affected your memory.//

**Subject:** Sure.

**Interviewer:** //You think that&#39;s unlikely?//

**Subject:**...I don&#39;t know what I think. Can we....can we resume this tomorrow? I need to...I need some sleep.

**Interviewer**: //Security will escort you to your quarters. Your security clearance is temporarily suspended. Let me emphasize &#39;temporarily&#39;. You are not to discuss these events with anyone.//

**Subject:** I just want to go to bed.

**Interviewer:** //Drop by the pharmacy. They&#39;ll give you something.//

**Subject:** I don&#39;t want a tranquilizer.

**Interviewer:** //Suit yourself.//
