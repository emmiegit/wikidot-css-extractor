Jerry lost his brother Evan when he was only a child. The world wants him to believe that Evan died in a natural disaster, that his death was a meaningless tragedy for which no one could be blamed. Jerry knows better. He knows his brother was taken from him, and he will stop at nothing to uncover the truth. This quest will put him in conflict with some of the greatest powers in the anomalous world and force him to question whether he can trust the people closest to him.
