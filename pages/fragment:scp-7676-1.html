**Item Number:** SCP-7676

**Object Class:** Memetic

**Containment Class:** Maksur

**Special Containment Procedures:** Photographs of North Hillcrest students have been disseminated throughout the site. Any changes in the depicted subjects are to be recorded.

Zulu-9 is built around the North Hillcrest High School, and is hereafter referred to as the Exclusion Zone. Unauthorized entry into the Exclusion Zone is forbidden and must be prevented at all costs. The following measures have been taken to prevent entry:

* All entrances into the Exclusion Zone, save for the front entrance, have been sealed with concrete. The front entrance is fitted with an airlock that may only be opened through majority approval of High Command.
* Twelve Scranton Reality Anchors (SRAs) have been placed around the Exclusion Zone, excluding the area of the auditorium.
* The Exclusion Zone is secured with three tiers of ground-level, subsurface, and aerial automatic security.
* Load-bearing points around the auditorium have been fitted with nitroglycerin-based molecular explosives. If the above measures fail, they are to be detonated. Evacuation of on-site personnel is a secondary priority.

Upon entering the Exclusion Zone, SCP-7676-G are to be apprehended. They must then be sedated and prepared for surgical debridement. Medical staff are to carefully excise the dermis and subcutaneous tissue of their face. These are to be labelled with the student&#39;s name and placed on full display in Sector-2 for monitoring, and the site will be put on high-alert should any of these faces begin to show signs of rot.

[[div class=&#34;inline-colmod&#34;]]
Once the operation is complete, the instance must then be administered a paralytic agent and prepared for delivery to Site-19. At every step, care must be taken to

[[/div]]

Any Null-Engram personnel displaying outward and repeated expressions of sentimentality for the past are to be restrained and observed until the completion of their CADENCE event. The resulting SCP-7676-G will then be operated on and disposed of as outlined above.

Personnel are not to enter the hallway to the auditorium.

**Description:** SCP-7676 is the group designation for the anomalous events and phenomena centered around the North Hillcrest High School and its Senior Class of 1976, located in Franklin County, Wyoming. Its overall nature is highly dynamic, and it is capable of adapting to countermeasures and neutralization attempts.

SCP-7676&#39;s primary characteristic is a virulent infohazard, termed SCP-7676-RECALL (SCP-7676-R), which attacks by way of weaponizing nostalgia.

[[div class=&#34;inline-colmod&#34;]]
Persons who regularly interact with information pertaining to North Hillcrest High School or its Senior Class of 1976 are susceptible to SCP-7676-R. There is a greater risk for those who directly handle artifacts originating from the school or
[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=personal effects of the aforementioned students. | content=the lasting marks of the aforementioned students.]]

[[/div]]

It should be noted that SCP-7676-R is primarily empathetic, being dependent on the experiences of the individual exposed. Null-Engram disqualifications were put in place to limit the vulnerability of personnel involved in the project.

In SCP-7676-R&#39;s early stages, the infected will regularly idealize or fret over their past; specifically, their childhood. It is through this obsessive recollection that the infected may undergo a CADENCE event wherein they experience:

# An enlargement of the temporal lobe, and the development of a targeted form of hyperthymesia relating to memories of one&#39;s adolescence.
# A burning sensation behind the ears.
# Memories that begin to feature places and persons unknown, but purportedly intimate, to the subject.
# Depersonalization and body-image issues, along with an irrational fear of having their faces touched.
# Intrusive childhood memories from the perspective of another person.
# Feelings of numbness, temporary bouts of partial paralysis.
# Ego death, followed by a single-minded fixation on intrusive memories.
# A separate personality forming on the basis of intrusive memories.
# Violent and immediate full-body transfiguration.

The end result of the transfiguration is an instance of 7676-GESTALT (SCP-7676-G) - a subject who is the perfect mental and physical duplicate of one of North Hillcrest&#39;s Senior Class of 1976, specifically, a deceased student. Instances of 7676-G created through CADENCE events exhibit no anomalous traits besides a cellular stasis upon death - the students&#39; bodies will not decay until that student&#39;s identity subsumes new infectee, at which point it will rapidly rot.

Instances of 7676-G will proceed towards North Hillcrest High School and attempt to enter the school&#39;s auditorium. If they are successful, all photographic or recorded depictions of the subject will alter in some way which severely disfigures the face, leaving them unrecognizable. Heavy scarring, penetrative injuries, the removal of facial orifices, and deep lacerations have all been observed, with depictions varying across multiple images of the same subject. Furthermore, their entry inevitably triggers unpredictable reality-altering and chronological phenomena at random. While this has previously included events nation-wide, it is no longer restricted by distance.

[[div class=&#34;inline-colmod&#34;]]
Based on the escalation of phenomena as more student identities are subsumed by SCP-7676, as well as the body of evidence collected over the years (see addenda), it is believed that a full assembly of the student body
[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=would trigger an XK-Class End-of-the-World Scenario. | content={{will allow the ceremony to begin.}}]]
[[/div]]

The auditorium currently houses over 99% of the North Hillcrest Senior Class of 1976, with the majority being comprised of personnel and civilians that have undergone CADENCE events. The congregation continually plays a simple ten note tune -- SCP-7676-MELODY -- vocally and on all manner of orchestral instruments, with only minor aberrations such as students singing out of key, or playing the wrong note occasionally.

Several anomalies relating to SCP-7676 are contained and cataloged by the Foundation under a variety of Item Number designations. While previously studied alongside SCP-7676, its developing virulence has lead to the loss of numerous Foundation personnel on these projects. These objects&#39; files have since been edited by Null-Engram personnel in order to
[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=eliminate connections to SCP-7676. | content=eliminate the lives of involved students.]]

SCP-7676 was originally categorized in May of 1976, when the entire senior class and its faculty did not return home from school for several days. Dispatched agents observed the affected for a period of forty-eight hours, during which time they performed various mundane activities; such as attending classes and after-school events. The town&#39;s residents were similarly affected: the situation with North Hillcrest and its students was not  
[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=perceived as abnormal | content=a threat to you or your loved ones ]]
by any means.
[[/div]]

When not otherwise engaged in scholastic activities, students would line up in front of their lockers until the first bell of the next day. They would then sing, whistle or hum SCP-7676-M in concert with one another. The students would remain in this state ignoring outside stimuli regardless of their physical condition; some were found to have soiled themselves overnight only to continue the melody unabated. Faculty members would lie prone and remain silent during this time.

Further irregularities include:

* Thirteen students, while recorded as attending class, were unable to be located.
* A student council survey to determine the year-long school &#34;theme&#34; was returned with nonstandard answers filled in, such as &#34;Remembrance&#34; and &#34;Symphonic&#34;. All members of the band wrote in &#34;Penance&#34;.
* Students exhibited a complete lack of hostility, anxiety and any form of anti-social behavior, focusing on their studies and extra-curricular activities with zealous enthusiasm.
* Flyers were distributed regarding an upcoming &#34;Reunion&#34; concert and encouraging audience participation -- benefactors &#34;Syncope Symphony&#34; were explicitly thanked for donating several instruments.
* An increase in faith-based club participation was noted in all students and teachers, including known atheists.
* The corpse of Freshman Nathanial Lyons was found in the library. Cause of death determined to be from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the left temple.
* The auditorium was found to be impregnable.

The following is an interview with Valerie and Albert Abrams, local residents and parents to one of the missing students. The audio was recorded by Researcher Julia Locke the first evening of Foundation involvement; this transcription includes after-action notation from the agent.

##black|**Foreword:**## Agent Locke is permitted into their home under the pretense of Harvard recruitment for the couple&#39;s son, Kevin, who was among the missing students. Introductions and pleasantries have been cut for brevity.

//Mrs. Abrams is kind enough to start some tea before joining us in the living room. She takes a seat across the coffee table from myself; her husband stands behind her. Both of them are grinning ear-to-ear all the while. Mr. Abrams has a noticeable eye tick.//

**Locke:** Now, uh, before we get started, where is Kevin?

**Mr. Abrams:** Kevin? Oh. Well, he should be in school right now. Class is in session.

**Mrs. Abrams:** Such a good boy.

**Locke:** Class? What classes does North Hillcrest provide this time of night?

**Mr. Abrams:** //[Laughs.]// Our Kevin has many responsibilities. He&#39;s a strong young man.

//He places a hand on her shoulder.//

**Mrs. Abrams:** Such a good, good boy.

**Locke:** At 8:00 on a Saturday?

**Mr. Abrams:** He has a lot of people counting on him. Do you have any id--

**Locke:** I&#39;ve actually checked the school&#39;s itinerary. There&#39;s nothing scheduled for tonight, let alone this weekend, sir. School is not in session.

//They exchange a confused glance here, and fail to meaningfully respond.//

**Locke:** Mister and missus Abrams, I&#39;m sorry, but... when was the last time you saw your son?

**Mr. Abrams:** Well, you - //[sniffle]// - you know how it is with teenagers, always zipping in and out of the house. God bless. My boy has so much on his plate.

//Something shifts in Mrs. Abrams. There&#39;s this look on her face: eyes widened, mouth agape -- the slow-dawning realization that something&#39;s amiss. That it doesn&#39;t add up. I lean in, giving my most sympathetic look.//

**Locke:** How long has it been, Mrs. Abrams?

**Mrs. Abrams:** I heard him! Last? [pause] Last night! I stood by his bedroom door and I could hear him!

**Mr. Abrams:** Val?

**Mrs. Abrams:** I heard him and I could hear him… our boy! He - he was right there! I sat on the other side of the door and I could hear him! I could hear our boy, Al! Our Kevin was here!

**Locke:** What was your son saying, Missus Abrams?

**Mrs. Abrams:** Oh, he wasn&#39;t speaking at all, Justine, he was singing! Our boy, he had the voice of... it was the voice of an angel.

Forcible removal from school grounds was sufficient to return students and their families to their right state of mind. The faculty were able to be evacuated thereafter. None were cognizant enough to provide concrete information on the missing students, or the auditorium&#39;s inaccessibility.

The building was closed and cordoned off under pretense of a gas leak. The students were to be redistributed throughout nearby school districts for a period of two weeks while investigators thoroughly canvassed school property and prepared for a breach of the auditorium. This would be interrupted by Incident-7676-1.

The following is a list of events that occurred the evening after the removal of North Hillcrest&#39;s student body, as recounted by eyewitnesses and security feeds.

**[21:32]** - Several dozen students are noted to be missing from their homes, and are reported wandering through the streets. Those who lived closest to North Hillcrest begin to arrive on school grounds, congregating on the football field. Reinforcements are requested by Foundation agents.

@@@@
[[div class=&#34;inline-colmod&#34;]]
**[21:36-21:53]** - Over fifteen students occupy the football field, and refuse to comply with orders to disband. Mobile Task Forces are dispatched -- ETA projected at twenty minutes. An on-site agent approaches in order to intimidate the teens to leave. He retreats when the students look upon him in unison, claiming  
[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=&#34;they all have the same face&#34;. | content=&#34;they all have the same face&#34;. {{All as one is all we are. You can be too.}}]]
The school bell chimes, and a single student approaches the building.
[[/div]]

The entire senior class fully assembles in the field. The assembly takes the form of a cross. All students recite SCP-7676-M as Foundation staff cease defensive maneuvers and lay down in the grass. The school bell chimes. The exterior door connecting to the auditorium opens of its own accord, and a second student departs from the crowd, following the first towards the open doorway.

The sound of instruments can be heard emanating from within the auditorium. They are playing a discordant cacophony, with each instrument being out of harmony with one another.

**[22:55-23:03]**  Task Forces arrive on-scene and move in to intercept, and easily detain the second student. The school bell chimes, and a third approaches.

Agents Reeds and McDowell are tasked with rescue of the first student as he steadily approaches the stage, whose curtains are drawn. Krogulski and Shields are instructed to man the doors to ensure they do not close. The rest of the unit works to disperse the crowd via deployment of tear gas.

The auditorium is infiltrated as tear gas is fired into the crowd. Reeds and McDowell advance on the stage cautiously, calling out to the student through the din of music. He ignores them, and clambers up onto the stage, disappearing behind the curtain.
 
Out in the field, the squadron has broken the lines of student belligerents, many of whom fled the gas. The few remaining are swiftly detained. One young woman is nonresponsive.

McDowell is the first to reach the stage, heading up the stairs from the right wing. He shouts over the noise, receiving no response. The pair reach center-stage in front of the curtain. Reeds takes point, readying his weapon. McDowell stands to the side, grasping the curtain. With a free hand, he counts down silently from three, and then pulls back the curtain.

**[23:04]** The remains of thirteen adolescents are seen scattered across the stage, held aloft by an unseen force. Though their bodies are limp, their hands can be seen to move, unsteadily playing their respective instruments. Due to the grievous damage to their faces, they are unable to be recognized.

[[div class=&#34;inline-colmod&#34;]]
The male student retrieves a trombone, and there is a deafening crack as his neck is instantly bent backwards from a heavy concussive force. His body is held in place. As he brings his head forward, it can be seen that little remains of his face beyond
[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=the viscera of a large gaping wound. | content={{the visage of an angel.}}]]
He places the cup of the trombone to this wound, and begins to play.
[[/div]]

**[23:05-23:15]** Krogulski is struck with the door as it attempts to close. Both her and Shields strain to keep it from closing, and relay this development to Reeds and McDowell. All agents are able to successfully exfiltrate, and the door slams shut.

Foundation staff rendered immobile by SCP-7676-M recover with no issue, and the remaining students experience confusion, having no recollection of their behavior. The unresponsive student is found not to be breathing, eliciting cries of concern from her peers as they beg for medical assistance.

Medic Johansson kneels next to her, and attempts mouth to mouth resuscitation. The first attempt fails, with Johansson reporting the lack of a pulse. He leans back in to try again, and the school bell chimes. The unresponsive student&#39;s face rapidly putrefies as Johansson places his lips on its mouth.

[[div class=&#34;inline-colmod&#34;]]
Johansson recoils and retches as the cadaver is sharply lifted into the air and towards the auditorium doors. As they do not open, her remains
[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=are messily pulled under the door&#39;s bottom clearance | content={{are shepherded to that golden place. She is reborn among the choir}}]]
over the course of several minutes.

**Afterword:** The Task Force would remain on-site in order to establish an exclusion zone to prohibit future entry and prepare for isolating the town under Blackout Protocol.
[[/div]]

The morning after the incident, Sites-19, -23, -38, and -169 received reports of numerous medical anomalies in their jurisdictions. Over fifteen comatose individuals, ages ranging from 4-19, were found to have suddenly expired overnight. Further, a six-year old patient in Tennessee who was recovering from routine surgery suffered a grand mal seizure and died within minutes. In cases where a time could be identified, these were found to correlate to the male student&#39;s interaction upon the stage.

Staff at Site-106 would also report an incident involving a car crash on Interstate 40. First-responders inspecting the remains of a young adult ejected through the windshield found them to be responding to stimuli, despite their skull having been fatally crushed upon impact. Based on calls to emergency services, the accident had occurred concurrently to the dead student&#39;s absorption by the auditorium.

All seniors of North Hillcrest were captured and sent to a detainment camp at Site-41. Due to families&#39; insistence that their children were simply attending school, no disinformation measures needed to be maintained. They were held in detention for interview and study. None were able to provide actionable intelligence or an explanation for their behavior, and were noted as speaking with a tone and cadence mimicking the notes in SCP-7676-M. They did not seem to be aware they were doing so.

[[div class=&#34;inline-colmod&#34;]]
The chaotic music emanating from within the auditorium had not ceased. As no anomalous effects were detected in D-Class who were exposed to it, an Analytics Department team was tasked with recording and study of the composition.
[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=The date of the Reunion concert endorsed by Syncope Symphony came and went, | content=The date of the Reunion concert endorsed by Syncope Symphony came and went, {{We can wait as long as it takes. We have our whole lives ahead of us, after all.}}]]
and no changes were noted to occur with the auditorium.
[[/div]]

By early August, several personnel at Site-41 had adopted the speaking cadence of the North Hillcrest students. Further, agents stationed within the Exclusion Zone began to report that family members of the students had begun to sing or whistle SCP-7676-M while in public. Quarantine measures were enacted, limiting the number of afflicted personnel to 27.

[[div class=&#34;inline-colmod&#34;]]
On August 21st, the Analytics Department submitted their findings to Site-41&#39;s leadership. Of over 300 hours of recorded audio, no correlation could be found when comparing sections of the composition to either classical or contemporary orchestral arrangements. When cross-referenced to material archived in Foundation records, a single match was discovered: the composition was found to be a perfect reproduction of a 1957 D-Class performance of
[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=SCP-012. | content={{Can you hear it? She&#39;s calling to you, Julia.}}]]

[[/div]]

A secondary analysis of SCP-7676-M in light of this revelation identified the progression of notes within it to coincide with select notes from the opening sections of SCP-012. This information was relayed to High Command, and an order for Decommissioning was issued. Affected staff remained in quarantine, and all remaining 113 students were terminated. The families were handled thereafter.

There was nothing that could be done. Research into memetics and infohazards was still very much in its infancy around this time, and there was a lot of uncertainty with how the situation would develop with an rogue element over one hundred strong. This was the Bowe era, mind, and the general didn&#39;t take well to rogue elements, much less ones in poorly-understood fields.

Affiliations of Syncope Symphony only deepened fears. The turnover rate for those working on a Syncope anomaly was staggering -- not simply for the cognitive dangers to personnel, but from the horrors we personally had to witness in these schools. The //things// these anomalies would do to their bodies -- //to their faces!// -- it was unbearable. There were times we couldn&#39;t so much as identify victims.

[[div class=&#34;inline-colmod&#34;]]
Time and again we could do nothing to stop these tragedies: the Camp Kanab phenomena out in West Virginia, Salvation High in Indiana, //Kirk Lonwood// -- the list goes on. Either our planning was too poor, containment too light, or we simply couldn&#39;t act in time to save these kids. Without swift action to neutralize the situation, we risked

The Analytics Department report was the final nail in the coffin. We&#39;d been trying to reproduce something coherent from SCP-012 for decades by this point, picking up on attempts by earlier organizations dating back into antiquity -- failing miserably time and again to get anything even remotely listenable out of it.

Now, up to this point, &#34;Syncope&#34; had been largely assumed to refer to &#34;syncopation&#34;. Some had assumed the name related to the mental affects of anomalies stemming from their influence, as in pathology, &#34;syncope&#34; refers to consciousness loss. Easy connection to make.

In a grammatical sense, however, &#34;syncope&#34; defines the //omission of sound// from within a spoken word. Lib(r)ary. Choc(o)late. Ma(d)am. The removal of key elements to change the //sound// of the end result.

During Incident 7676-1, several Foundation personnel were exposed to SCP-7676-M, including eighteen Mobile Task Force personnel and Researcher Reese. Rsr. Reese had come to North Hillcrest to study the potential memetic effects of SCP-7676-M. As such, he volunteered to isolate himself from the Foundation at large in order to document the effects of the SCP-7676-M. Dr. Weirn volunteered to study Rsr. Reese during the process.

Attached is a journal Dr. Weirn kept during this time, with sensitive information redacted.

I went to see James Reese for the first time today.

I found the containment for James to be unnecessarily strict. Two guards gave me a mental evaluation test, and I had to pass through an airlock to enter the concrete-lined containment cell. I&#39;ve seen these measures used to contain some of the worst monsters in the world. Seeing James in the cell, comfortable with his furnishings he&#39;d brought from home, was a nice juxtaposition.

We sat down on the couch together and watched some TV. I&#39;ve always found it surprising that we&#39;re able to get //The Six Million Dollar Man// down here. I was glad to see James was able to relax. To the untrained eye, he still seemed to be just his normal self. He made jokes about his &#34;all-expenses paid vacation&#34; and drank quite a bit of beer. To me, however, he seemed a bit more quiet than usual. It was like he was stuck in thought.

Here&#39;s a specific conversation I remember:

&#34;Hey, do you know about the Panoptic project they&#39;re working on at Site-19?&#34; he said. He spoke in a monotone, to avoid transferring the meme.

&#34;I know //of// it,&#34; I replied, in monotone as well. He was stationed to the project before he was transferred to 7676. &#34;What do you need?&#34;

&#34;They were running an experiment for it. New visualization tech, something to that effect. Could you fetch the results for me? I wanted to see if I could give my thoughts on them.&#34;

I shook my head. &#34;Even if I could, I doubt they&#39;d let me take anything written by you out of here.&#34;

He laid back. &#34;It&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to be useful to the Foundation much longer.&#34;

[[div class=&#34;inline-colmod&#34;]]
We were quiet for a few minutes after that. I wanted to ask

I&#39;ve requested the instantiation of a mandatory exercise routine for James. Professionally, it&#39;s difficult to tell between symptoms of SCP-7676-M and the effects of a sustained sedentary lifestyle. Personally, he&#39;s been getting fat.

I told James about it, and while he complained that &#34;he came here to get //away// from his wife&#34;, he understands.

Speaking of which, no real symptoms yet. Thank God. Maybe this is all there is to it?

First real sign of infection today.

There were signs, earlier. James kept wanting to watch reruns of //The Life of Riley//. I didn&#39;t catch it at the time, but he probably watched it quite a bit as a kid. Today, all he wanted to talk about is his childhood. The summer camps he went to, playing ball in the yard. He&#39;d talked about it before, and I figured he was just letting his life flash before his eyes. Now, he seems genuinely distressed over it.

&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he said. &#34;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not able to talk to you anymore.&#34;

Researcher Hopkins noted something similar, in one of the MTF agents that was exposed. I&#39;ve requested the file from him.

⁃ Site-41: Notes recovered from Dr Hopkins and an infected Dr Weirn form the basis for designating the emergent SCP-7676-R and SCP-7676-G phenomena. Dr Weirn is placed under quarantine, and the former Rsr. Reese is isolated for study. All personnel present during Incident 7676-1 are detained and placed in quarantine, as are any personnel exposed to SCP-7676-M in the course of their research.

⁃ Exclusion Zone: Agent Emerson becomes violent upon being unable to recognize his reflection, and has to be sedated. He is sent to Site-41 to recover.

⁃ Site 41: Two infected personnel transfigure into North Hillcrest students. Due to the sound emitted during the process, it becomes referred to as a CADENCE event.

++ February, 1977

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
⁃ Site 41: A conference regarding Syncope Symphony is held at Site-41. Attending are containment specialists and project leads for a number of anomalies with ties to the group.

⁃ Police reports filed in Franklin County and the surrounding areas reveal that several alumni who had graduated from North Hillcrest between 1946-1975 have gone missing.

⁃ Site-41: Doctor Hopkins is discovered by his secretary holding a one-way conversation over the telephone.

Dear sirs and madams of Overwatch Command,

I have received your request for my retirement, and I must respectfully decline. I know SCP-7676 better than anybody. I am the only one who knows what needs to be done. After all these years, I finally see it.

How deeply have you pored into my past? Of course, you were looking for infection vectors -- anything that might risk breaching containment. You had to have known my medical history. You //know// what I went through in &#39;75.

For twenty-three days, my darling Amalie fought for her place on this Earth. Twenty-three days of prodding. Of surgeries. Of cold hands and unfamiliar voices. Blinding lights beating down on eyes that would never open. We were fortunate to have access to the level of care afforded to those in our line of work. In the end, it simply wasn&#39;t enough -- she was simply too underdeveloped to breathe on her own.

What little time her father and I had with her -- brief moments of respite for skin-to-skin contact -- I hold those blessed few hours with me in my heart. A life sustained only in memory.

She deserved to have a chance. The opportunity of life. She deserved to love, to //laugh//, to experience the successes and the failures and sadness and joy and all those small moments we all take for granted. It&#39;s the gift those kids at North Hillcrest are trying to give us all; the change they&#39;re trying to make. It&#39;s what Syncope has been working towards all this time: a chance at life for those who have had theirs stolen.

I&#39;m going back to that school, back to where it all started. I will take my place among the chorus and with every goddamn ounce of air in my lungs I will sing. All of my breath for hers.

I have not been compromised. My name is Julia Locke, and I am of sound mind. I am acting of my own volition in order to uphold our noble Foundation&#39;s Third Mission statement: the order to Protect. The salvation of countless thousands is at stake, and it would be a failure of my duty -- both to our organization and as a mother -- to not  mend the wrongs of the past and ensure a brighter path ahead for humankind.

I won&#39;t be here to see that tomorrow. I&#39;ll never witness with my own eyes when all of our families are reunited, and the streets come alive with precious laughter and song. I know that I&#39;ll never see my little Amalie.

I can only pray that she will keep me in her memory.
[[&gt;]]
