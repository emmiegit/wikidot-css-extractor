&gt; The following has been compiled by Priest Stars in the two-hundred fourteenth winter after Spear&#39;s Unification. So that our tales of Kings and Heroes may not be forgotten. May the sun shine on you.

[[size larger]]**The Song of the First**[[footnote]]Written unknown. Oldest sections dated before the reign of Spear.[[/footnote]][[/size]]

//The sun shined bright.//
//Above the blue sea.//
//The sun shined bright.//
//And the blue sea split.//
//To the ground the sea fell.//
//And the island shined above.//

//The water was lonely.//
//And so the island split.//
//The island fell and the tall hills rose.//
//The sun shined bright.//
//It&#39;s creatures brighter.//
//The brightest the First.//

//The First they emerged.//
//They went wide and they went far.//
//Their Kingdom shined bright as the sun.//
//We will go to the afterlife.//
//The First cheered.//
//No you will not.//
//Said the sun back.//
//It is not time, you will not.//
//Said the sun back.//

//Yes we will.//
//As one they cheered.//
//We bow to you no longer.//
//We will build towers stretching to the sea.//
//With birds of metal.//
//We will see the sea above.//
//And we will not stop our wake.//

//Yes you will.//
//The sun shouted back.//
//Fire and death it rained.//
//Their towers it shattered.//
//Their birds of metal fell.//
//Poison filled the land.//
//The First were no more.//
//The winter was long.//
//The poison faded.//

//I will make one better.//
//The sun made the seed.//
//And down the seed went.//
//To the island below.//
//And the great tree it grew.//
//It’s seeds it dropped.//
//To the land below.//
//The trees they grew.//
//The grass and the bushes.//
//Sun, River, Fire, and Hill.//
//These are the Kingdoms you will make.//
//And those which will be one.//

[[size larger]]**The Song of Spear**[[footnote]]Originally written 5BU. Fourth stanza added 0AU.[[/footnote]][[/size]]

//You are not the sun.//
//The King of the River said.//
//The sun shines bright, your spear does not.//
//Nor does this army you massed at my gates.//
//The King Under the Sun you call yourself.//
//You could not light dried thatch.//
//And the King Under the Sun he glowed.//
//The Sun shined on the villages.//
//The Sun shined on the river.//
//The sun shined on the sealeaf crown.//
//And the King of the River Said.//
//You are the sun.//
//The sun shines bright and so does your spear.//
//And this army at my gates shines brightest of all.//
//The King Under the Sun you call yourself.//
//The King of the Sun I call you.//

//You are not the sun.//
//The King of Flames said.//
//The sun is fire, the sun is me.//
//And he threw his fire at the King of the Sun.//
//The Shield he jumped and blocked the blaze.//
//And the King of Flames was snuffed.//

//The King Under the Sun he said.//
//Now I will rest.//
//For I must fight again in time.//
//But the King of the Hill he spoke.//
//You are not the sun he said.//
//You are flesh like the rest.//
//We are hard as stone.//
//And we will not let you rest.//

//The King Under the Sun he fought.//
//For one winter.//
//Then two.//
//Then three and four and five.//
//Until the sun and stone met.//
//You do not shine.//
//The King of the Hill said.//
//Nor do you.//
//Said the sun back.//
//Through maces and spears they fought.//
//And the stone finally cracked.//
//The sun it shined on the broken stone.//
//And then burned out.//

//We are the sun.//
//The King Under the Sun.//
//We are the fire.//
//The King of Fire.//
//We are the river.//
//The King of the River.//
//We are the Hill.//
//The King of the Hill.//
//We are the Plant Kingdom.//
//The King of the Plant Kingdom.//

[[size larger]]**I am the Hill**[[footnote]]Written unknown. Dated possibly before Spear, or more likely during Shield.[[/footnote]][[/size]]

//I am the Hills from end to end.//
//I am the stone that makes them.//
//I am the trees that grow on them.//
//I am the clouds that snag on their tops.//

//I bow not to the sun.//
//I bow not to the flame.//
//I bow not to the stream.//
//I bow not to none.//

//For I am the Hills from end to end.//
//The stone that rises to the great sea above.//
//And I bow not to none.//

[[size larger]]**The Shield of the Kingdom**[[footnote]]Written throughout the reign of Shield (0AU-11AU).[[/footnote]][[/size]]

//I am the fire.//
//The King of Fire said.//
//I will not burn.//
//I will turn not to ashes but to flame.//
//Brighter than the sun and hot to melt stone.//
//I will not burn.//
//Now his ashes feed the grass.//
//I will not burn.//

//I am the River.//
//The Branch of the River said.//
//I am the Hill.//
//The King of the Hill said.//
//United we are Kings.//
//And United we will rise.//
//The Iron heard them say.//
//The River reached out and the Iron was no more.//
//But the Stone it heard.//
//The Stone it told the Sun.//
//And the river ran dry.//

//This Branch is soft.//
//The King of the Hill said.//
//The sun had cracked it.//
//And I will break it.//
//We will be the hardest Hills.//
//And bow not to none.//
//The winters they came.//
//Under the sun they cracked.//
//In a cave he was betrayed.//
//And the sun shined on the Hills.//

//The tree of the Kingdom.//
//The King stands top.//
//As the sun shines upon.//
//Yet who keeps it up?//

//I am the Root beneath the ground.//
//I am the Root that keeps you up.//

//So you may shine in the light.//

//I have no songs.//
//I have no glory.//

//I bow not to none.//
//The Hunter said.//
//To none but my King.//
//To my unbreakable Stone.//
//And to none else.//

//Not to this bird.//
//Not to this elk.//
//Not to this bear.//

//For this bear is weak.//
//This bear is prey.//
//Her chance is bleak.//
//My mace will fray.//

//For I am The Hunter.//
//And the animals bow.//
//But the bear it did not bow.//

//For I am weak.//
//I am prey.//
//My chance is bleak.//
//And I am frayed.//
//For I am The Hunted.//
//Until the end of days.//

[[size larger]]**What Kings Leave Behind**[[footnote]]Written possibly during the reign of King Stone. Rumor has its origins with an executed soldier.[[/footnote]][[/size]]

//I drift in silence.//
//Broken and dead.//
//The battle, still raging.//
//In my broken head.//

//And so I drift.//
//In silence far away.//
//And so I drift.//
//Broken and dead.//

//The shields they break.//
//And so I drift.//
//The battle, still raging.//

//And so I drift.//
//In silence far away.//
//And so I drift.//
//Broken and dead.//

//While the dead they cut.//
//The heads they break.//
//And so I drift.//
//With my broken head.//

//And so I drift.//
//And so I drift.//
//Broken and alone.//

[[size larger]]**Snowflake&#39;s Blizzard**[[footnote]]Possibly written by King Snowflake early in his reign. All I ask claim to have never heard it.[[/footnote]][[/size]]

//Under the clouds.//
//Where the sun doesn’t shine.//
//Stone and Snow Rains.//
//The Kings in the darkness.//
//Stone and Snow Rain.//

//Where the snow falls like leaves.//
//No sound to be heard.//
//No sound but the snow.//
//And the crack of stone.//
//No sound but the snow.//
//And the crack of sun.//

//For the sun will rise again.//
//And spring has sprung.//

//The sun it shines.//
//With warmth and light.//
//The sun it shines.//
//With summer flame.//

//But the summer it ends.//
//Warmth and light dim.//
//Summer it ends.//
//The summer flame dips.//

//The leaves they turn.//
//Red and yellow.//
//Even orange.//
//As the sun grows dimmer.//

//The leaves they fall.//
//To the ground they lie.//
//To the ground they return.//
//To the ground the snows land.//

//Winter it arrives.//
//And the snow it too.//
//For when the sun is dimmest.//
//The rain it freezes.//

//Great shining sun.//
//Thank you for your light.//
//Even in the dimmest.//

//Great shining sun.//
//Thank you for your warmth.//
//Even at your weakest.//

//Great shining sun.//
//Thank you for your life.//
//For when spring arrives.//
//We are stronger.//
