**Item #:** SCP-6184
    
**Object Class:** Safe      

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6184 is to be kept in a 2 m x 2 m x 2 m standard containment chamber in the minimum security wing of site-17. No CCTV system is required and there is no need for agents to guard SCP-6184. Security level 2 is required in order to access the anomaly. 
 
**Description:**  SCP-6184 is a normal-looking gramophone, measuring 25cm wide, 76.4cm high and 25.7cm long, with the anomalous ability to change any vinyl it plays into a vinyl of Frank Sinatra. However, this vinyl, known as SCP-6184-1, is only able to play the song &#39;&#39;Come Fly With Me&#39;&#39;, even though it seems that there are more songs graved on the disk.

When someone plays a vinyl using SCP-6184, a version without lyrics of &#39;&#39;Come Fly With Me&#39;&#39; will start playing, and the exact person who made it play, now SCP-6184-2, will begin to sing along to the song, with proper tune and rhythm.

If someone is within earing range of 6184-2, they will become an instance known as SCP-6184-3, and will undergo the following effects:
* SCP-6184-3 will start humming //&#39;&#39;Come Fly With Me&#39;&#39;//, following the rhythm of SCP-6184-2.
* SCP-6184-3 may start to dance or clap their hands while humming. These events seem to occur randomly.

If SCP-6184-3 is looking at SCP-6184-2 and starts blinking, the clothes of SCP-6184-2 will then change to become &#39;&#39;style &#39;50&#39;&#39; clothes (See Addendum 6184.1). This event can also happen if many SCPs-6184-3 are blinking at the same time. 

After consultation with 05-█, SCP-6184 can be removed from his cell and used by staff members when a special occasion arises (the annual Christmas party, for example). On the other hand, each and all uses of SCP-6184 must have been authorized by Dr. ███ two weeks prior to the said special occasions.

--There are no side effects of SCP-6184.-- Some evidence suggests that SCP-6184 could cure diseases such as depression, and improve general well-being (See Addendum 6184.2).

**Addendum 6184.1:** __Discovery__
SCP-6184 was retrieved on 19/03/89 in an abandoned house near Camdenton, Missouri, by MTF Eta-11. The Foundation has sent Eta-11 to investigate the house after a group of young men reported //&#39;&#39;not feeling in control of their own body after hearing somebody unknown to them singing&#39;&#39;// (the identity of this //&#39;&#39;unknown person&#34;// is still not known by the Foundation, and an investigation is still in process) to the local&#39;s authorities.

Agents ███ and Pam noticed a vinyl next to SCP-6184, and Agent ███ tried to play it, after securing the house. He then started to sing while Agent Pam started dancing. The rest of Eta-11 didn&#39;t suffer from any effects, as they were unable to hear Agent ███ singing, who was in an isolated room with Agent Pam. Agent Pam blinked, then opened his eyes just to see that Agent  ███ was now wearing a blue jacket and black tie, a white shirt, a grey felt hat, and black polished shoes. When the song finished, both SCP-6184-2 and SCP-6184-3 stopped singing and dancing, and both agents reported the event to the rest of the team. Agent ███  seemed confused when he saw what he was now wearing, but didn&#39;t suffer from other effects except confusion. MTF Eta-11 then safely transported SCP-6184 to site-17.

**Addendum 6184.2:** __Incident 6184-A-1__
//Conversation between junior researcher K. Fleury and senior researcher J. Holland.//

&gt; **K. Fleury:** I&#39;m telling you, John! He seemed happy!
&gt; 
&gt; **J. Holland:** Kaile, you know he his not himself since his wife died, I&#39;ve told you that story a 
&gt; million times.
&gt; 
&gt;  **K. Fleury:** I didn&#39;t imagine Doc, he smiled! He... he shook his head!
&gt; 
&gt;   **J. Holland:** I&#39;m going to tell you one last time. Dr. Smithson is dead inside, and nothing can change that! He wasn&#39;t happy when you saw him, and you know I&#39;m right.
&gt; 
&gt; **K. Fleury:** You will see John, next time we play that thing, you will see that I&#39;m right.

**Addendum 6184.2.1:** __Dr. Holland&#39;s report on incident 6184-A-1 and Dr. Smithson&#39;s behavior with SCP-6184__
&gt; Kaile, that son of a gun. He was right. 
&gt; Nobody, and I mean __nobody__ has ever seen Dr. Smithson smile. In fact, nobody actually talked to him. since his wife died, he&#39;d always work with a look of death on his face. He was not himself anymore. He was no longer a man. 
&gt; But we&#39;ve recently tested SCP-6184 with D-███, D-███, Dr. Fleury, Dr. Fortin, and myself. Fleury, Fortin, and I wore standard impenetrable hearing protection equipment, so we wouldn&#39;t hear 6184-2. I briefly looked at the door and realized somebody failed to close it completely. 
&gt; I rushed to the door to close it and that&#39;s when I noticed a shadow on the door. This shadow seemed to dance. I got out of the chamber just to see Smithson clapping and dancing, with a large smile on his face. I closed the door, the music ended and he told me: //Thank you for letting me hear this song a second time, I think I&#39;m slowly recovering from...// He burst into tears without finishing his sentence. SCP-6184 is likely capable of being used as a treatment for mental illnesses involved in the improper production of chemicals affecting one&#39;s overall mood, such as depression or executive dysfunction. 
&gt; I am therefore going to study the mental and medical effects of SCP-6184. Testing on pathologically deaf people could also reveal amazing results.

**Addendum 6184.3:**  __Test log 6184-A-2 by Dr. Holland__
&gt; Dr. Fleury and I wondered if the effects of SCP-6184 could be applied to deaf people. Three D-Classes were tested. Dr. Fleury volunteered to be 6184-2. I approved his request.
&gt; 
&gt; D-8967 is an ex-tank gunner in the British Army, who became deaf as a result of long exposure to noise above the human hearing limit, due to his time in the army.
&gt; D-5346 is a former jewelry store guard who was stabbed in the ear with a screwdriver during a robbery. The only after-effects were post-traumatic shock and a ruptured left eardrum (D-5346 wore hearing protection in his right ear so that he could not hear 6184-2 through his good ear).
&gt;  D-9237 is a murderer, deaf from birth, suffering from Waardenburg syndrome. He has never been able to hear in his life and has never used a hearing aid to improve his condition.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Fleury played SCP-6184 and began to sing uncontrollably, all in the presence of the three D-Classes and myself, and I was the only one wearing full hearing protection. 
&gt; D-8967 began to hum and dance, a sign that he could hear Dr. Fleury. Medical tests later indicated that D-8967&#39;s ears were as good as new and now had 20/20 hearing. To date, this has not changed.
&gt; D-5346 began to clap his hands. Once again, D-5346&#39;s ears were as good as new and could hear perfectly.
&gt;  D-9237 had no reaction, however, and was just walking around in the testing chamber, waiting for the test to be finished. The ears of D-9237 were not modified in any way.
&gt; 
&gt; In the light of this new information, we can conclude that SCP-6184 can cure certain hearing problems. These problems, however, seem to be curable only if they are not pathological, such as trauma or accidents, and not syndromes. 
&gt; Dr. Fleury also theorized that SCP-6184 could actually be sentient, and could decide who to cure and who not to cure. This option seems rather far-fetched to me, but what is certain is that further testing will be necessary.
