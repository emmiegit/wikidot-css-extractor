There couldn&#39;t be.
The Foundation wasn&#39;t real anymore.
There was no God was left to pray to.
There was no reason to hope. No reason to wait for anything.
This was all I had.
@@ @@
It felt hard to keep my hope, at first. My faith.
I thought I could power through.
Feeding was all I had to distract myself.
I knew that I was going to reach an escape, some day.
@@ @@
I reminisced about her.
I had no other memories. Nothing remaining.
But she was still there.
I could feel her, waiting for me on the other side.
She was alive. She was okay. She was there for me.
A guiding light, something to hold onto.
Something to hope for.
And she had somebody by her side.
@@ @@
I longed to see him.
I had gone before I could hold him, cradle him, shower him in all the love he deserved.
But I&#39;m sure she did such a good job.
I&#39;m sure he&#39;s doing great.
@@ @@
But I&#39;ll never meet him, will I?
@@ @@
My hope slowly dwindled, with time.
I began to forget. To relinquish control.
I kept feeding, but it wasn&#39;t to escape anymore.
The light was an illusion.
I had finally realised.
There had never been an escape.
@@ @@
What was the point?
What was there to reminisce? To think about? To fantasise?
None of it would ever come true.
I felt too weak to do anything.
But I couldn&#39;t stop. I was stubborn.
I had to keep going, even if I knew it was pointless.
@@ @@
I&#39;ve been waiting for this for such a long time.
@@ @@
I lied.
There is an escape. There is a light on the other side of the tunnel.
There is a God to pray to. Something to hold onto.
I&#39;ll never see her again. I&#39;ll never see him.
But this is the best that I have.

It was a beautiful symphony, wasn&#39;t it?
If you heard it, of course.
I can hear it, ringing in my ears.
It&#39;s coming from all sides now.
And it&#39;s never stopped. Not for a second, since it began.
But it&#39;s coming to a close. I can **feel** it.
A grand finale.
A single chance, for me.
It&#39;s so precious.
@@ @@
I won&#39;t stay here for much longer.
I know there&#39;s no one reading this, but I have a bit of hope left.
A bit of hope, to believe that there&#39;s someone who knows.
I just one want thing, if I&#39;m truly right.
Check on her for me, will you?
@@ @@
A single crescendo. A downwards descent.
It&#39;s the final seconds. 
Of my symphony. My beautiful symphony.
There won&#39;t be anything after this.
What will it be like?
Darkness? Eternal light?
A paradise? A wonderful new world?
Or simply nothing?

It doesn&#39;t matter.
