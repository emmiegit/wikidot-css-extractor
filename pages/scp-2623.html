**Item #:** SCP-2623

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2623 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell at Adjunct Site-394. SCP-2623-1 is to be contained in a specialized, refrigerated containment chamber at Site-394.

**Description:** SCP-2623 is a 27 year old human female identified as Karen Jones. SCP-2623 is capable of instantaneously transporting itself to a single location inside Adjunct Site-394 in New York City, New York, at will. Site-394 was, prior to its acquisition by the Foundation, a cafe on 52nd street in New York City.

SCP-2623&#39;s ability has shown no limitations with regard to range (testing has been performed for distances up to 12,000 kilometers). SCP-2623 is capable of transporting both itself and up to 345 kilograms of material.

SCP-2623-1 is the corpse of a 29 year old human male identified as Thomas Williams. SCP-2623-1 is extensively decomposed. If SCP-2623-1 is moved further than 1.2 kilometers from Site-394, SCP-2623-1 will be transported to Site-394 in a manner similar to that of SCP-2623.

**Discovery:** SCP-2623-1&#39;s anomalous properties were identified after its death. Several attempts by emergency services to move the object to a local hospital were stymied by the object&#39;s anomalous properties, resulting in identification and containment by the Foundation (originally as anomalous object 436).

Following several years of containment, SCP-2623 was discovered inside Site 394, past several security locks. SCP-2623 was disoriented but cooperative with Foundation staff who identified SCP-2623&#39;s possible anomalous properties (which were later confirmed during testing).

**Addendum 1:** SCP-2623 on multiple occasions has claimed to have no knowledge of SCP-2623-1. Several followup interviews with SCP-2623 yielded no information concerning SCP-2623-1. Despite this, SCP-2623 is otherwise cooperative with Foundation staff.  A test for the previous use of amnestics returned a negative result.

**Addendum 2:** The following unopened letter was found in SCP-2623&#39;s former apartment. It is the only recorded reference to SCP-2623&#39;s anomalous properties.

&gt; I&#39;m an idiot. You&#39;ve always known that. I think deep down so did I. 
&gt; 
&gt; But I don&#39;t wanna let you go.
&gt; 
&gt; Don&#39;t worry. This isn&#39;t me not getting the hint. I saw the letter. I know you don&#39;t want to see me again. I&#39;m not going to try to make excuses for letting you slip away. Work was not more important than this.
&gt; 
&gt; If you wanna put an ocean between us, I understand. But I would be the biggest idiot in the world if I didn&#39;t try just one more time to let you know what you mean to me. I am in love with you.
&gt; 
&gt; __Babe, I am in madly love with you.__
&gt; 
&gt; Remember how you crinkled your nose when I blew out the candles the first night I told you that? It took me three years to get up the nerve. Do you remember when I had my wreck over Christmas and you cried and cried but never left the hospital room? How about when I proposed to you out on the lake and I fell into the water? I thought we were gonna have the rest of our lives to laugh about that.
&gt; 
&gt; If you never come back, then I&#39;ll always remember your laugh, your smile... the good times and the bad. I hope the world is kind to you. I hope you learn to love again. 
&gt; 
&gt; No matter how much you wish I wouldn&#39;t, and no matter how far you go, remember that there&#39;s someone in this world who loves you. And they always will.
&gt; 
&gt; //~t//
&gt; 
&gt; PS. If you change your mind you&#39;ll find me at that little cafe on 52nd. Just... think of me and you&#39;ll never be alone. If you ever wanna try again... we can have coffee.

**Addendum 3:** During a cataloging of items in SCP-2623&#39;s former apartment, an agent noted that the letter was addressed to a Karen James in another apartment from the same building. Further investigation has indicated that the intended recipient had previously ended a relationship with the individual now known as SCP-2623-1.  

Additional questioning of SCP-2623 has indicated that SCP-2623 and Karen James often received correspondence addressed to the other individual due to the close proximity of their addresses and the similarity of their names.
