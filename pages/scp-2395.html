**Item #:** SCP-2395

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Observation Post 44 is to maintain communication and support from Area-30 while continuing surveillance of SCP-2395 and SCP-2395-A. A precautionary 250m radius zone around SCP-2395 has been established, which Observation Post 44 will continue to monitor for any notable movement or activity. Further information from SCP-2395-A&#39;s occupant has been deemed unlikely following communication with Dr. Mill.

**Description:** SCP-2395 is a giant price tag, located at 82°08&#39;02.1&#34;S 16°59&#39;05.5&#34;W in Antarctica. Observing aerial drones have recorded SCP-2395 to have the price of &#34;$҉ 585.98&#34; [sic].

SCP-2395 is tied to a small rebar loop embedded in the ground by a 0.7m length of twine. SCP-2395&#39;s dimensions are 258m by 90m in length and width; a 2.5 m layer of Polyethylene covers the paper inscribed with SCP-2395&#39;s price.

SCP-2395 possesses unpredictable centrifugal and centripetal movement around the rebar loop, usually being manipulated and shifted by unknown forces in random directions and velocities. One instance has occurred where SCP-2395 maintained a constant velocity of approximately 65km/h on the date of 11/2/16, spinning clockwise for 49 seconds. Researchers note the twine that secures SCP-2395 to the rebar loop may possess anomalous tensile properties.

SCP-2395-A is a wooden shack located 0.3km east of SCP-2395. The structure is empty, save for a room in which an unknown individual, presumably a human female, prohibits access from within. The door to their room is engraved with the initials &#34;L.C.E.&#34; This individual (designated SCP-2395-B) has responded to no verbal communication, but has occasionally been recorded conversing with other entities.

**Addendum 2395-Q:** [{{__8/2/1968__}}] After numerous attempts to establish an interview with SCP-2395-B, surveillance cameras recorded a saw protruding from the door, creating a rectangular hole akin to a mail slot, and a scrap of paper being pushed out. A written message on the paper contained the following:
&gt; fine, write down questions and ill get to them in my down time

Dr. Mill from Area-30 was brought to communicate with SCP-2395-B, and suggested continued usage of paper notes to recover more information. Note that SCP-2395-B&#39;s responses are received in one to two days following Dr. Mill&#39;s responses.

&gt; **Mill:** So if you would prefer I pass notes like this, rather than converse, all I&#39;d like to do is ask a few questions regarding your environment and role, would this be fine?
&gt; 
&gt; **2395-B:** ≤10 words or else you&#39;re wasting my time
&gt; 
&gt; **Mill:** Could you explain why you&#39;re here?
&gt; 
&gt; **2395-B:** It&#39;s fricking cold all day and I have work
&gt; 
&gt; **Mill:** What kind of work?
&gt; 
&gt; **2395-B:** I&#39;m waiting for purchase offers. The price isn&#39;t set in stone, but this is the kind of minimum we have to offer to make a profit
&gt; 
&gt; **Mill:**  So you&#39;re working for an organization?
&gt; 
&gt; **2395-B:** You blind or something, name&#39;s on the door
&gt; 
&gt; **Mill:** Can you explain the price tag&#39;s movement?
&gt; 
&gt; **2395-B:** Already said I&#39;m trying to make a sale here. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Mill:** What exactly are you selling?
&gt; 
&gt; **2395-B:** Earth.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mill:** Please elaborate.
&gt; 
&gt; **2395-B:** Earth, planet, terra nova, blue ball of life, flesh cesspool, etcetera.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mill:** That doesn&#39;t explain the price tag&#39;s movement.
&gt; 
&gt; **2395-B:** Well, you know when you pick up a stick with a dying leaf on it? Or when you pick up something at a store with a price tag attached to it and inspect it a bit, and the price tag might flop around a bit? And you might grab the price tag to get a look at the price? Now imagine something else looking at that price tag. Actually scratch that, since you can&#39;t. 
&gt; 
&gt; You getting it now? We&#39;re selling the Earth. And I&#39;m busy speaking to willing buyers.
&gt;  

**Addendum 2395-LC:** For more information regarding Group of Interest &#34;Light Courier Enterprises&#34;, contact Dr. Mill for [[[Radiance-and-Cachinnation|abnormal incidents]]]. Further information can also be obtained from [[[SCP-1920]]], [[[SCP-1940]]], [[[SCP-1740]]], and [[[SCP-2940]]].
