[[div class=&#34;story&#34;]]
The Site Director has to be wrong. She has to be! There&#39;s no way both O5-3 and O5-9 were wrong. It occurs to you that instead of bowing down and pretending you were wrong, you should have name dropped them. It&#39;s their word against hers. It doesn&#39;t matter now, though — you&#39;re going to have to do this yourself, and you don&#39;t even know if SCP-3939 really exists.

There&#39;s only one way to be sure — you&#39;ll have to go see it yourself.

You make your way down to PC01 — the Pre-Containment sector — and navigate your way to where you were told SCP-3939 is being kept. The door is electronically sealed, so you swipe your access card on the scanner. A red light becomes green, there&#39;s a click, and the door slides open — slowly at first, then faster, then slower again as it finishes opening. There&#39;s a very brief, very slight rush of air into the room, as if someone&#39;s been locked in here for a very long time and the oxygen is rushing back in.

You step into the room, and it&#39;s pitch black.

It&#39;s a square block of concrete with plenty of space. Concrete floor, five by five meters or so, walls a little under three meters high, ceiling same as the floor, and boy is it cold in here. It&#39;s a summer day, but the walls here are thick, and you&#39;re deep inside the building where there&#39;s no space for windows. Your breath mists in front of you.

Two bar lights on the ceiling suddenly flare into life, the leftmost burning a bright white stripe into your eyes and the rightmost flickering gently as if it can&#39;t decide whether to be on or off. Illuminated between them is a short pedestal, on top of which rests an antique gramophone.

A great brass horn stares directly up at you, the inside of the cone disappearing into darkness within. It&#39;s attached to an octagonal base of what could be polished mahogany — you&#39;ve never been an expert on wood, and when it comes to writing the description, you&#39;ll probably get Carlos to do it for you. On the front of the base is the logo of the manufacturer — the little white dog staring down into the horn, thinking his master is trapped somewhere inside the phonograph, only hearing his voice and not realising that it&#39;s an imitation. On top of the base lies a single vinyl record, unmarked and unblemished. It&#39;s in perfect condition, despite the gramophone&#39;s needle digging into it, and despite the fact that it&#39;s still ectoentropically spinning even though there&#39;s clearly no power source.

What&#39;s next?

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3939/offset/16 Tell Carlos to write a proper fucking description.]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3939/offset/66 Get to a computer and write the description yourself.]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3939/offset/24 Take a look at the spinning vinyl record.]
