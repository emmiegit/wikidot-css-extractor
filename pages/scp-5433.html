**Item #:** SCP-5433

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5433 is stored in a standard item locker at Site-19. 

**Description:** SCP-5433 is a 1960s era Love Tester arcade machine, the manufacturer of which is currently unknown. All identifying information (including ID number and brand name) on SCP-5433 has been forcibly removed. SCP-5433 operates similarly to a normal machine of its type; an individual must insert the necessary currency (0.25 USD) and grip the activation handle, at which point the machine will determine the user&#39;s &#34;sex appeal.&#34;[[footnote]] This has later been found to be determined by a combination of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5596 random chance and grip strength.] [[/footnote]] SCP-5433&#39;s primary anomalous traits will appear upon activation.

SCP-5433 possesses a Class-V &#34;sapient&#34; intelligence; it is capable of self-awareness and advanced communication on par with typical human interaction. Examination of its internal structure reveals no unusual technology. SCP-5433 communicates verbally through a small speaker located on the front of its chassis. Questioning as to the nature of its anomalous capabilities has been inconclusive (See **Addendum 5433.1**).  

SCP-5433 was recovered from the Bendiz Diner, New Jersey, USA, on 18/10/2020 by covert operatives investigating unrelated anomalous activity. After questioning, the owners of the diner admitted to both being aware of SCP-5433&#39;s properties and using it to attract customers to their business. The diner&#39;s staff was then amnesticized and the item was confiscated. SCP-5433 was moved to Site-19, documented, and placed in temporary storage. Primary examination of the object is --scheduled for 08/11/2020-- currently underway.


**Addendum 5433.1:** Preliminary inspection of SCP-5433.

&gt; = **Interview Log-001**
&gt; ------
&gt; **Date:** 08/11/2020
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** SCP-5433
&gt; 
&gt; **Supervisor(s):** Researcher Marco Peña, Researcher Mariana San Elia
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** The following is a transcript of Researcher Peña&#39;s interview with SCP-5433 while it was held in a temporary holding cell under low security.
&gt; ------
&gt; = **[BEGIN LOG]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Peña:** This is Marco Peña, conducting an initial interview with SCP-5433. //(Adjusts microphone)// Are we set?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher San Elia:** Mics are good, cameras are running. Time is... //(checks watch)// nine o&#39;clock, standard time. You can start whenever you&#39;re ready. I&#39;ll be taking care of some work in the other room, just me know if anything goes wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** All right. //(Pause)// Beginning interview now.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Researcher Peña inserts 0.25 USD into SCP-5433 and grips the handle. SCP-5433 activates.)// 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Welcome, brave soul, to the Love Tester! Dare to find your //true// romantic potential? Or do you wish to know about the //Juliet// to your //Romeo//?
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** No, thank you. I&#39;m here to ask a few questions, if that&#39;s possible.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Questions? I love questions. Ask away.
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** It&#39;s not about love, I&#39;m afraid. I need to know a little about you. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Not about love? But that&#39;s impossible. //Everything// is love. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** Can you tell me about—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Describe to me your soulmate.
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** What can you tell me about your manufac—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Come on, give me something to work with! A lot of guys would kill to be in your position. One-on-ones are in high demand.
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** I&#39;m single, but I&#39;m—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Oh, single he says. My lucky day.
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** Listen, I&#39;ve been asked to find out who built you and how you can talk, that&#39;s it. No love, no romance. Got it?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Ugh... wait. Where&#39;re my manners? I never got your name.
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** My name&#39;s Marco. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Where do you work? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** I work for uh... a research company.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Research company, my ass! You must be one of those Foundation guys. Yeah, I know your type. Well, that explains why you&#39;re still single. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** How do you know—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Diner gossip. You&#39;d be surprised how many people still eat at those museums. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** Are you gonna answer the question or no? I can always mark you down as &#34;non-cooperative&#34; and they can haul you off to deep storage.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Hey, I&#39;m just trying to get you your money&#39;s worth. Two bucks ain&#39;t cheap. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** I appreciate the gesture but all I need is for you to answer the question. Now, do you know who built you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Let me think... gosh, it&#39;s been so long. Love Testers haven&#39;t been in style since the 70s you know. //(Pause)// Hmm, now that I think about it, it could&#39;ve been that penny arcade back in Madison. Always thought there was something funny with the managers at that place...
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** //(Taking notes)// Okay, and do you know anything about the identities of your cr--
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** No no, it must&#39;ve been at the Chevron off the Eighty-seven. One of the regulars worked with cars for a living. Built machines all the time. I&#39;m pretty sure he had enough weed on him to make any machine sentient—but enough about me. I want to know about you! I&#39;ve been antsy for some romance, and you strike me as someone who hasn&#39;t seen some action in—
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** Listen, I work ten-hour shifts six days a week, I haven&#39;t had a day off since college, I&#39;ve spent God-knows-how-long having conversations with talking bears and, oh I don&#39;t know, dancing peach cobblers. The last thing I need right now is to have you talk back to me every time I have to check off a box!
&gt; 
&gt; //(Silence for several seconds.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** Okay, I may have overstepped the line. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** //(Hushed)// Besides you, is there anyone else here?
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** What? No, it&#39;s just me.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Where&#39;s that girl you were talking to earlier?
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** I&#39;m not sure what you--
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Back when you did the mic check you talked to someone. Where is she?
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** You heard that? She--she&#39;s my supervisor, she&#39;s in the other room. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Now we&#39;re getting somewhere. Alright, here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen. In a couple minutes I&#39;m going to start malfunctioning. While this is happening, you&#39;re going to go get that girl and tell her I&#39;m freaking out. Really sell it, okay? Once she&#39;s in the room, I&#39;ll reactivate and take it from there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** Wait a minute. You know all of this is recorded, right? I--I don&#39;t want to lose my job over this.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** The way I see it, I&#39;m your best shot at getting anywhere with her. I&#39;m a pro at this, trust me. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** I--I can&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Come on, I know how you feel about her. I&#39;ve been monitoring your pulse and perspiration through your hand this whole time. You&#39;re not going to get another chance like this. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(Silence.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** Fine. I&#39;ll do it. But don&#39;t screw it up, okay?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Relax, I got this. Let&#39;s see if I still remember how to do this part...
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-5433 begins to shake violently. After a moment, sparks are seen flying out of various points on its chassis. A loud grinding noise plays over its speaker.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** Okay, okay. //(Louder)// Mari? Mari, can you come here for a second? Something&#39;s up with 5433.
&gt; 
&gt; **San Elia:** //(Distant)// Okay, give me a second.
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** //(Quietly)// This better work.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Researcher San Elia enters the room.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **San Elia:** Wha-- Jesus, Marco, what the hell happened?
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** I--I don&#39;t know. I was going over the sapience checklist, then it... it started doing this.
&gt; 
&gt; **San Elia:** Okay, okay. We need to call someone. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** N—no, we might be able to wait it out--
&gt; 
&gt; //(Researcher San Elia reaches for the emergency telephone.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** H--hold on a second! It&#39;s stopping.
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-5433 ceases movement. A soft whirring sound is heard as its components stop rattling.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Ahh, that&#39;s better. I was just telling Marco how much I wanted to get to know some of his coworkers. Isn&#39;t that right?
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** Yes, yeah. We were just talking about my job and uh, your name came up. 
&gt; 
&gt; **San Elia:** What the hell Marco! You know we&#39;re not supposed to talk about that with skips. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** I didn&#39;t say anything confidential, don&#39;t worry. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Listen, I have //no// interest in whatever Men in Black business you got here, trust me. I figured since Marco&#39;s so great, why not talk to his friends? Come, have a seat. I&#39;ll tell you anything you want to know about me. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** I&#39;d do what he says. This is the most cooperation I&#39;ve got out of him so far.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Researcher San Elia sits across from SCP-5433.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **San Elia:** Well... did you cover its manufacturer yet?
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** Yeah, but... I couldn&#39;t get a straight answer. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Sorry guys, I can&#39;t remember that far back. Memory gets kind of foggy, you know?
&gt; 
&gt; **San Elia:** Well, what about sapience?
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** I got it right h--
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** All right, I&#39;m gonna cut to the chase. My friend Marco right here, he is //madly// in love with you. I mean really, this guy was just going on and on about you. Hell, we pulled this whole stunt to get you in here, isn&#39;t that crazy?
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** What? Cut it out, I never said anything like that. //(To San Elia)// Oh come on, you&#39;re gonna believe him?
&gt; 
&gt; **San Elia:** I—I uh, I don&#39;t know—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** His heart rate&#39;s going up right now, see? See?
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-5433&#39;s display highlights the word &#34;Wild&#34;, then &#34;Burning&#34;.)// 
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** Hey, stop that! Turn it off!
&gt; 
&gt; **San Elia:** //(Laughing)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5433:** Marco, I can&#39;t make this any easier for you. Miss San Elia, he&#39;s just a little embarrassed, I swear. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** It&#39;s not what it looks like! I—he—this is... //(pause)// well shit. He&#39;s telling the truth.
&gt; 
&gt; **San Elia:** Marco, this—this is too much. Don&#39;t tell me you planned this out.
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** //(Pointing to SCP-5433)// It was his idea. No, it was, I swear!
&gt; 
&gt; **San Elia:** //(Laughing)// You think I believe you? After you broke that coffee machine just so I&#39;d have to ask you to buy me some?
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** I can&#39;t believe you still think I did that! We checked the security tapes, remember? Wasn&#39;t me!
&gt; 
&gt; **San Elia:** You probably paid off the techies to doctor them, didn&#39;t you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** You think I have that kind of money? You&#39;re crazy.
&gt; 
&gt; **San Elia:** Says the one who made a skip their wingman! That&#39;s what you are, aren&#39;t you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** No way, tell her about th--
&gt; 
&gt; **San Elia:** Hey, wait a second... I think something happened to the skip.
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-5433 is silent. Its display is stuck on the words &#34;Hot Stuff&#34;.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** ...What happened?
&gt; 
&gt; **San Elia:** I... I think it ran out of juice. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(The words &#34;Insert 25 Cents&#34; appears on SCP-5433&#39;s coin slot.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Peña:** I&#39;ll... uh, call up security. Get this thing moved downstairs. 
&gt; 
&gt; **San Elia:** Yeah, yeah. Good idea. I can take care of the transcripts and... you think maybe we can grab a coffee after this?
