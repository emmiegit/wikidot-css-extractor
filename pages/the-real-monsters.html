When I was a little boy, I was afraid of monsters. 

They always lurked in the dark places where the light didn&#39;t reach. It didn&#39;t matter how many times my father shone a flashlight into the dark corners of my closet; I knew, the moment that the light was gone, that the monsters would come back. They would lurk in the darkness and whisper to me. I would cower under my blanket and hope they would go away. Sometimes, they would, when the morning came, but I knew that the moment the darkness came back, the monsters would return too.

And they always did.

When I grew up, I learned why: the real monsters don&#39;t hide in dark corners and closets. The real monsters are the ones that live behind your eyes, in the darkness of your mind, and it takes more than a flashlight to send them away, more than a blanket to hide from them. They&#39;re always there, whispering to you, saying terrible things that children don&#39;t understand. 

After enough listening, you&#39;d do anything to make them stop.

You&#39;ll find what you&#39;re looking for in the basement of the abandoned Murphy house. She&#39;s still alive - at least, the parts that I still had were alive the last time I visited her - but the others are long dead. I&#39;ve kept their teeth in ziploc bags in the old file cabinet. Maybe you can identify them from dental records. 

Anyway, she hasn&#39;t eaten in days, and she&#39;s lost a lot of blood, but she might still live if you hurry. If she wants to live, that is. The others didn&#39;t want to, in the end.

All I ask is that you leave the light on when you go. This prison cell is very dark, and I&#39;m afraid that the monsters will come out when you leave.
