Radio static crackles into his ear,
To the space-walking man bearing no fear—
A feeling like playing poker without packing an ace,
Or having no helmet in the stars of deep space.

&#34;Don&#39;t put the brush there and leave the blood dry—
Else we&#39;ll have to get fresh stuff
Like new blood and new dye.
That rune is messed up;
paint it anew—
Else you want to be split up into two.&#34;

The space-walking man heaves a great sigh,
For it is no small work
To paint runes in the sky.

//More like blood-rites is this art, since there is no chance
Of living on sadly, this miserable dance.
One strike incorrect,
And no air left to breathe...//
These things and more the space-man now grieves.

The spacesuit moves again
To see mistakes and amend
A task which seems to have not an end:

A red Celtic ring made from the genius of a man—
A man on the earth, who makes just the plan.
For it is another on Mars who carries through the rite
And paints all throughout the All-Gaping Night.

A few minutes later (and some several days)
A cold wind blows and some red dust fades:
The ill-suited man has now finished his scene,
A scene of old books and rotten dead dreams.

The time has come now for a chant to begin.
The final choir, quite, if the man wants to win.

He starts off slow, drawing much breath
Taking his time &#39;till he sees the Mark met.

With the planets aligned,
And the stars smiling above,
The Mars-man whispers words
Of sorrow and love.

And soon on true Earth
Does the spell take effect.
A true last spell, but not one so correct.
A rune for cows, and not one for leaves
Had been carelessly transcribed
In the darkness he sees.

And so ends the man, the first one on mars;
But he had unknowingly altered the stars—
Or the Fate, if you will, of a young, rough-worn boy
And set him to play into Life&#39;s daring ploy.</textarea></pre>
