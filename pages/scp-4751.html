**Item #:** SCP-4751

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4751 is held in a humanoid containment chamber with no windows or visual recording equipment. Containment personnel are to communicate verbally with SCP-4751 via closed-circuit telephone at least once every 24 hours. In the event of a containment breach, recapture is to be facilitated by remote means such as traps activated by proximity or external control.

**Description:** SCP-4751 is a 27-year-old male of Guatemalan descent and United States nationality. When SCP-4751 is within an entity&#39;s field of vision, SCP-4751 becomes completely imperceptible to all of the entity&#39;s sensory modalities. The individual &#34;viewing&#34; SCP-4751 can neither see, feel, smell, touch, or hear the anomalous person. This effects extends to individuals viewing video footage of SCP-4751, who are likewise unable to detect SCP-4751 in the video feed. Clothes or other items worn or held by SCP-4751 are also undetectable.

The anomaly associated with SCP-4751&#39;s person manifested roughly 18 months prior to detainment by Foundation agents.

**Addendum 4751.A: Interview Log**
&gt; **Interviewer:** Genevieve Jirati, Senior Containment Specialist
&gt; **Interviewee:** SCP-4751
&gt; -----
&gt; **Jirati:** Good morning, SCP-4751. How are we doing today?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4751:** I&#39;m fine. You know, don&#39;t suppose I could convince you to just call me Dario?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jirati:** I understand your concern.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4751:** But you&#39;re not going to change, are you? Not like I haven&#39;t asked before.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jirati:** Are you experiencing any issues with your chamber? Any electrical or plumbing problems?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4751:** [//Pause//] Oh, sorry, forgot you can&#39;t see me shrugging my shoulders.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jirati:** Very good. Please be aware, at some point in the next 72 hours, it will be necessary to move you to a new containment chamber. Please be ready to carry all of your belongings, as you will not be permitted to make multiple trips.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4751:** I don&#39;t even haveâ€”are you for real right now? What do you think I have in here when you won&#39;t let me have anything I can&#39;t wipe my ass with? I ask for a TV, request denied. Ask for books, request denied. Ask for a half-finished crossword puzzle, request denied. How many copies of that same form letter do I have? I&#39;ll need both hands to carry that stack.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jirati:** I will be sure to pass your concern to the containment administrator. Also, I have this week&#39;s meal schedule. Please fill out your selections and return the form through your door slot.
&gt; 
&gt; //Telephone call terminated by SCP-4751.//

**Addendum 4751.B: Incident 4751-01**
SCP-4751 breached containment on 13 March 2020. He was first heard shouting near the service exit of Site-19. Personnel were initially unable to apprehend it until emergency shield doors sealed the cafeteria on level 3, holding SCP-4751 within. MTF Mu-2 (&#34;Stevie Wonder&#34;) was sent to return SCP-4751 to containment.

&gt; **Interviewer:** Genevieve Jirati, Senior Containment Specialist
&gt; **Interviewee:** SCP-4751
&gt; -----
&gt; **Jirati:** Good morning, SCP-4751. We need to discuss your escape attempt from yesterday.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4751:** Escape attempt? What are you talking about?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jirati:** Please, SCP-4751. You have nothing to gain by playing coy. It is important that you answer my question truthfully.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4751:** Tell me, Geni, how could I be honest about a made-up jailbreak?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jirati:** Why did you attempt to breach containment? Do you find your living conditions uncomfortable?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4751:** [//Scoffs//] You tell me, chief. You&#39;re the one concerned about accuracy and gathering data all the time. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve got an Excel doc tracking my mood, or whatever.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jirati:** Have you been in contact with any individuals, including non-human entities, outside of this facility?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4751:** Non-human? Uh, yes. The boogeyman. Appeared to me in a dream, actually.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jirati:** Is that a truthful statement, or are you speaking ironically?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4751:** Damn, chief, I thought the Air Force bureaucrats were fun suckers! This is the most interesting conversation I&#39;ve ever had with you!
&gt; 
&gt; **Jirati:** I&#39;m surprised to find you more upbeat than usual, SCP-4751. Please explain this change in behavior.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4751:** Well, you did pick up my brother, so it&#39;s nice to have some company for a change.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jirati:** Your ... brother? We weren&#39;t aware you had any siblings.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4751:** Come on, chief, why are you playing? Your muscle brought him in here yesterday!
&gt; 
&gt; **Jirati:** SCP-4751, I will need to continue this conversation another time.
&gt;
