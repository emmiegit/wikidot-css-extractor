**Item:** [[[SCP-7034]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** N/A

**Termination Test Record:** SCP-682 was contained in a specially constructed transport vehicle along with an armed escort and armed drones along the I-85 highway system. At approximately 28 minutes, the vehicle containing SCP-682 entered SCP-7034. The remainder of this record has been taken from various recording devices from the transport truck.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**

**&lt;00:28:12&gt;** Screaming and the sound of metal crunching is heard. Cameras show SCP-682 breaching the hull of the truck and exiting onto the highway.

**&lt;00:33:28&gt;** SCP-682 proceeds to attack and kill nearby vehicles.

**&lt;00:56:45&gt;** SCP-682 starts heading down the highway.

**&lt;01:14:43&gt;** Audio and visual footage of SCP-682 has ceased. 

**&lt;03:02:03&gt;** A tracker implanted in SCP-682 has activated, the remainder of this log is from the tracker.

**&lt;05:32:00&gt;** SCP-682 makes unintelligible sounds, believed to be a conversation.

**&lt;08:43:02&gt;** [REDACTED] 

**&lt;34:02:44&gt;** SCP-682 growls and then vocalizes sounds indicating pain. SCP-682 continued vocalizing in pain for a further 38 hours.

**&lt;90:02:56&gt;** The tracker&#39;s internal battery supply has expired. No further recordings are available.

**&lt;243:55:23&gt;** SCP-682 reappears at the point of demanifestation. SCP-682 appeared heavily damaged with multiple adaptations resembling [[[SCP-3470]]]. SCP-682 was recovered without issue. 

**&lt;END LOG&gt;** 

[[/div]]

//**Notes**: SCP-682 appeared to have found the exit to SCP-7034. How it managed to do so and why it adapted into SCP-3470 is a mystery, SCP-682&#39;s adaptation is truly remarkable. I propose further exploration into SCP-7034. -Dir. ████████ █████//

//**Notes**: Exploration into [[[SCP-7034]]] is pending, however, SCP-682&#39;s adaptation has shown a large amount of danger within SCP-7034, any further investigation of SCP-7034 requires approval by members of the Overseer Council. No tests involving SCP-682 with SCP-7034 are to occur. -O5-5//

**Item:** [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-204-th SCP-204-TH]

**Tissue Test Record:** Sample cut by SCP-204-TH hair strand and slowly began growing similar strands. Sample is fully converted into 204-TH hair stands after 10 minutes. 

**Termination Test Record:** Direct exposure of SCP-204-TH to SCP-682 disallowed due to subjects&#39; uncooperativeness and unreasonably high risk of specimen loss. Instead, several stands of SCP-204-TH&#39;s hair were taken and given to a D-682-767 to apply to SCP-682, which was restrained. 

&gt; **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt; **
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;**00:00:00&gt;** D-682-727 uses the SCP-204-TH strands to cut SCP-682 several times on its forelimbs and tail. 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;00:02:30&gt;**  Once the procedure is finished, SCP-682 was released from its restraints and allowed to roam around the testing cell. 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;00:09:46&gt;** After seven minutes, multiple large sections of hair similar to that of SCP-204-TH are seen rapidly growing out of and around SCP-682&#39;s wounds. SCP-682 notices this and begins attempting to pull the strands out of its forelimbs, causing major tissue damage. The strands appear to begin growing at a much faster rate.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;00:12:46&gt;** At this point, 78% of SCP-682&#39;s forelimbs and 54% of its tail are covered in SCP-204-TH&#39;s stands. SCP-682 stops pulling the strands and begins looking closely at the covered areas. SCP-682 begins moving one of its arms slowly, in a heaving motion.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;00:12:46&gt;** SCP-682 jerks its left arm forward, causing several strands to fly forward. SCP-682 then begins moving both forelimbs in this motion, causing multiple strands to drag and scrape across the floor in a manner similar to that of chains. SCP-682 does this same action for its tail.  
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;00:13:47&gt;** SCP-682 begins thrashing its forelimbs and tail around, in an attempt to use the stands as makeshift whips. Testing is aborted as SCP-682 begins using its strands to attack the main observation window. Security personnel is called in. 

Using Foundation Modified Incendiary rounds, security personnel were able to remove the strands on SCP-682&#39;s forelimbs and tail before it was able to breach containment. 

**Notes:** //I fail to see why we thought this would do anything major. Even if 682 didn&#39;t use the barbwire hair as whips, I doubt that it would have killed it. Unless the lizard&#39;s weakness is Tetanus. - Researcher June Quinheart.//

//According to the Testing Committee, they were hoping that 682&#39;s entire body would be converted into 204-TH&#39;s hair, leaving only a large body of barbed wire. To me, it seems that some of the researchers on this project are getting a little desperate. - Dr. Jerald Dino.//

**&lt;6/23/2036&gt;** SCP-7450-RACHAEL&#39;s path coincides with Site-14 where SCP-682 was attempting to breach the main gate.

**&lt;10.34 AM&gt;** SCP-682 appeared to spasm as it heard SCP-7450-RACHAEL&#39;s voice

**&lt;10.55 AM&gt;** SCP-682 starts to claw at its ears, vocalizes sounds indicating extreme distress and pain. At the same time, the first known instance of an SCP-7450-RACHAEL instance diverting from its path occurs

**&lt;11.13 AM&gt;** SCP-682 stops vocalizing, seemingly having succeeded making itself immune to SCP-7450&#39;s effect. SCP-7450-RACHAEL nears Site-14

**&lt;11.34 AM&gt;** SCP-682 attempts to look away from SCP-7450-RACHAEL however is anomalously forced to look at SCP-7450-RACHAEL

**&lt;12.01 PM&gt;** SCP-7450-RACHAEL demanifests. SCP-682 is now followed by all sentient entities that were affected by SCP-7450-RACHAEL. Counting by OBIL.AIC show one more entity following SCP-682. SCP-682 begins attacking all entities following SCP-7450-RACHAEL

**&lt;12.59 PM&gt;** SCP-682 succeeds in neutralizing all SCP-7450 entities and disappears. Currently, there is no information on the location of SCP-682

**Notes** //SCP-682 proves to be a much larger threat than previously anticipated. From previous records of SCP-7450 show that the entities are ontokinetic in nature. If SCP-682 was able to neutralize SCP-7450-RACHAEL; this proves that SCP-682 can adapt to possibly any threat. -Dir. ████████ █████//

**Item:** [[[SCP-591]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** Sample tissue added into an existing ZK-Class Scenario created by the anomaly disappeared, with zero trace being left of it. Due to this, a termination attempt was approved by the O5 Council in an attempt to destroy SCP-682, under the supervision of Dr. Weistess.

**Termination Test Record:** SCP-682 was rendered temporarily immobile via high powered tranquilizers, and was quickly moved to the testing site before it either woke up and or became immune to the tranquilizers. Once at the testing site, a SCP-591-# instance was to be inserted, and an isolated CK-Class Scenario would occur, leading thereafter to an isolated ZK-Class Scenario. The following events transpired.

&gt; **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**
&gt;     
&gt; **&lt;00:00:00&gt;** D-682-591 was instructed to insert SCP-591-45 into SCP-591 and activate it. 
&gt;      
&gt; **&lt;00:00:15&gt;** SCP-682 awakens, and attempts to break free of its restraints. D-682-591 is then instructed to activate SCP-591 as fast as they can if they wish to survive. Subject runs towards SCP-591 and grabs the cartridge as SCP-682 lets out a guttural roar as it breaks free of its restraints.
&gt;             
&gt; **&lt;00:00:27&gt;** D-682-591 inserts and activates SCP-591, causing an isolated CK-Class Scenario to occur just as SCP-682 charges at D-682-591. Visual contact is lost with both parties as the scenario continues.
&gt;           
&gt; **&lt;00:03:07&gt;** Local hume detectors show a ZK-Class Scenario forming where the CK-Class Scenario used to be.
&gt;      
&gt; **&lt;00:08:36&gt;** D-682-591 emerges from the localized ZK-Class Scenario wearing chainmail armour and wielding a bloody sword. Part of the subject&#39;s body is noted to have a glitchy appearance, with several pixels of the subject&#39;s upper torso phasing in and out of reality.[[footnote]] An investigation was led by MTF µ-1 (“Quantum Mechanics”), an MTF with the purpose of investigating, handling, modifying, containing, and possible neutralization of quantum-related anomalies that are a threat to normalcy and the world at large. Specifically, the MTF has a skill in fixing/repurposing devices that can bend quantum rules using tools at their disposal. The subsequent investigation discovered that the glitched area of the subject was quantumly fluxing between their current position and the isolated ZK-Class Scenario. [[/footnote]] The subject was also shown to be covered in wounds, bruises, and scratch marks. Their hair was also noted to be much longer and notably greasier, presumably due to a time dilation effect, which is a common occurence inside a ZK-Class Scenario produced by SCP-591. D-682-591 triumphantly claimed it had &#34;killed the beast&#34;, but before they could utter another word, SCP-682 emerged from the isolated scenario. It can be seen with multiple stab wounds to the upper torso and cranium. SCP-682 then grabbed D-682-591, and pulled them back into the isolated ZK-Class Scenario. Notably, security footage noticed that SCP-682 had a similar glitching effect that was seen on D-682-591. 
&gt;                
&gt; **&lt;00:11:59&gt;** SCP-682 emerged from the ZK-Class Scenario alone, with no trace of D-682-591 being found. It is presumed their body is still located inside the ZK-Class Scenario. SCP-682 appeared weakened, which allowed on-standby MTF teams to safely restrain and return SCP-682 to its containment chamber. 
&gt;         
&gt; The test is deemed a failure. 
&gt;         
&gt; **&lt;END LOG&gt;**
&gt;     

**Notes:** Subsequent interviews with SCP-682 claim that when the CK-Class Scenario occurred, the environment around both it and D-682-591 shifted to that of a medieval fantasy land, with D-682-591 being given its chainmail armor and sword, while SCP-682 retained its original form, with the only exception being that it also sprouted wings. It is currently theorized that this is due to SCP-682&#39;s natural form somewhat resembling that of a dragon, but lacking wings, so the CK-Class Scenario gave it wings in order to make it look more like one. In addition to this, the glitch-like effect found on SCP-682 and formerly D-682-591 subsided after two weeks in containment.

**Notes:** //At this point, we need to look at things with a new perspective. We can&#39;t just chuck it at every dangerous or reality-destroying anomaly we come across for the umpteenth time and pray that it will finally die. God knows we&#39;ve tried. What we need to do is look for something to weaken it first, so then later we can hit it hard. We need something to incapacitate it and make us able to then kill it. At this point, we can throw poop at it for all I care, as long as we get one step closer to killing that fucking lizard. -Dr. Weistess//

**Item:** [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-030-de SCP-030-DE]

**Notes:** The Foundation&#39;s German branch permitted the usage of SCP-030-DE instances to be tested with SCP-682. This test was authorized on the basis of understanding how SCP-030-DE could be utilized regarding SCP-682 containment breaches.

**Tissue Test Record:** An instance of SCP-030-DE is set to &#34;Single Fire&#34; and fired at a large tissue sample. Examination of the inside reveals violent tearing. 

**Test Record:** An MTF operative was given an instance of SCP-030-DE and told to aim it at SCP-682 through the observation window in its standard testing cell. After setting the gun to &#34;Single Fire&#34;, SCP-030-DE fired at SCP-682&#39;s leg, causing the sound of violent cracking to be heard. SCP-682 roared in pain as it began limping toward the direction of the observation window. The operative then fired SCP-030-DE at SCP-682&#39;s other legs, causing the same damage. After SCP-682 roared in pain again, its legs began vibrating, and the sound of flesh and bones moving could be heard.

After a couple of minutes, SCP-682 had regenerated its leg bones and began moving towards the window at a much faster pace, only for the subject to fire at its legs again. SCP-682 quickly began regenerating again, however, large pieces of bones began tearing through its legs, indicating an error in the process. Despite this, SCP-682 started to rapidly move toward the window. The operative responded by switching SCP-030-DE to &#34;Continuous Fire&#34; and randomly firing on SCP-682&#39;s body. Sounds of bones cracking were heard as SCP-682 began bleeding from its mouth. After that, the test was concluded. 

//Notes - Due to a limited supply of SCP-030-DE instances, the request to use them as standard equipment during SCP-682 containment breaches is pending.//

**Item:** [[[SCP-7911]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** A tissue sample from SCP-682 was exposed to a SCP-7911-1 instance, and the following effects were observed: The bandages remained applied to the tissue sample for two days, after which they caused rapid deterioration of the underlying tissue, causing complete destruction of the sample within several hours. Surrounding tissue did not aid in the regeneration of the destroyed tissue until the complete removal of SCP-7911-1. 

**Termination Test Record:**
SCP-7911-2 pills were administered to SCP-682. A full three weeks went by with no noticeable effects, after which SCP-682 experienced immediate accelerated degradation at the cellular level. Wounds began to open up at a rapid pace, causing massive damage. SCP-682&#39;s regenerative abilities were unable to keep up pace with the rate of cellular destruction, however, they managed to significantly slow down the degeneration process. After a total of 36 consecutive hours, SCP-7911-2 had inflicted every wound SCP-682 had ever received and the anomalous effects stopped altogether.

**Notes** //While this termination attempt gave us a bit more insight into the exact functioning of SCP-7911-2, it was ultimately very unhelpful. -Researcher Upkins//

**Item:** Tungsten APFSDS projectile traveling at Mach 8

**Notes:** Following a containment breach on 6/17/2023, SCP-682 was severely wounded and incapacitated within four miles of the Pacific Ocean near ██████. Railgun destroyer //SCPS Wallace Stanton//, which had recently left its nearby port, was ordered to fire upon the injured SCP-682 in an attempt to finish it off.

**Tissue Test Record:** Test records from 9/2/2015 show tissue samples being completely incinerated when struck with railgun projectiles. Because this test was arranged so quickly, up-to-date results could not be obtained.


**Termination Test Record:** From a distance of 20 miles, //SCPS Wallace Stanton// fired a shot from its forward railgun at SCP-682, which had lost over two-thirds of its body mass after being engaged by MTF Nu-7. In its injured state, SCP-682 was unable to react or adapt to the incoming projectile before it made impact. Once the cloud of dust and debris had cleared, MTF units incinerated all visible remains of SCP-682 and chemically sterilized every surface within a 300-foot radius of the impact site. Test deemed a tentative success.

Roughly 60 hours later, reports of crocodile-like organisms attacking civilians in the suburbs of ███████ were discovered by Foundation personnel. Field agents determined that these organisms were in fact smaller instances of SCP-682 which had been consuming both the local population and each other in order to regain body mass. It is theorized that the impact from the railgun projectile launched small pieces of SCP-682 several miles away from the impact site, which then regenerated into smaller SCP-682 instances that reconvened in ███████. MTF Lambda-12 assisted in recovering all eight of the remaining instances, after which point they consumed each other until only one whole SCP-682 was left.

Following the test, SCP-682 has shown increased resilience against bullets and other kinetic energy-based weapons. Research into methods of circumventing this are currently ongoing.

//**Note:** SCP-682 made absolutely no attempt to avoid or adapt to the railgun shot, which even at this point is practically unheard of. I know we don&#39;t usually try termination methods more than once, but if we can find a way to shoot 682 with this thing and then clean up every single scrap of it that survived, we may finally be onto something here. -Dr. Scherzer//

**Item:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tanhony-s-proposal-ii SCP-001-BLACKMOON]

**Tissue Test Record:** N/A

**Termination Test Record:**
An SCP-001 Event occurred causing the entirety of SCP-682&#39;s body to transmute into a black substance. SCP-682 immediately regenerates from a previously unknown skin sample located at Site-███. SCP-682 then cackled and stated the following, &#34;Ah, so it&#39;s happening, well you&#39;re doing my job for me aren&#39;t you? Truly disgusting...&#34; 

SCP-682 proceeded to vanish from its containment chamber. It is currently unknown how SCP-682 vanished and the exact location to where it vanished to.

Note: //Given the results of crosstesting with SCP-423 had on a fictional universe, it is likely that the same thing would happen to our universe if we attempted to crosstest with SCP-1304. In fact, for the sake of our reality&#39;s continous existence, it is paramount that no text simultaneously containing SCP-1304 and SCP-682 be allowed to exist at any given time.// - O5-6

**Item:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2874 SCP-2874]

**Tissue Test Record:** N/A

**Termination Test Record:** A metallic cube containing SCP-2874 is lowered into a provisional observation chamber inhibiting SCP-682. SCP-682 is then exposed to SCP-2874. The chamber is then filled with acid per standard containment procedure.

Approximately 7 months following this event, SCP-682 becomes visibly irritated and attempts to breach containment several times to no avail. A week after this behavioral change is first observed, SCP-682 spontaneously explodes, and its remains dissolve in acid. Reptilian entities measuring around 5 cm in height begin regenerating from SCP-682&#39;s remains. After 2 hours, close to 500 smaller replicas of SCP-682 occupy the chamber and begin breaching containment at a very slow rate. After 5 hours, instances collectively give up all hope of breaching containment and gather together at the center to regenerate into a full SCP-682. SCP-682 attempts to breach while shouting profanities at research staff, but is subdued and relocated to its original containment site. 

Further attempts to expose SCP-682 to SCP-2874 have resulted in SCP-682 immediately becoming agitated, beginning to twitch and regurgitate, cursing Foundation staff and attempting to breach the walls of its cell.

**Item:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/kate-mctiriss-s-proposal SCP-001-KATE]

**Tissue Test Record:** Upon editing and saving the page, the SCP-682 tissue sample was erased from baseline reality at exactly 9 a.m. of 28 May 2012, just as outlined in the edits made to the SCP-001 file.

**Termination Test Record:** The &#34;Special Containment Procedures&#34; section of the SCPF Database page ⦿/Procedures/001/SCP-001.ftml was personally edited by O5-10 to include the following statement:

&gt; SCP-682 will immediately and entirely be removed from existence upon the saving of this document. SCP-682&#39;s erasure will not cause any damage to baseline reality and will not leave any traces behind. Every Foundation personnel ever killed by SCP-682 will be brought back to life unharmed. Every Foundation asset destroyed, along with all financial resources lost by the Foundation due to SCP-682 will be returned.
 
These edits were approved unanimously by the Site Directors&#39; Executive Committee of the Whole and the O5 Council. The file was then saved.

[[collapsible show=&#34;[DATA EXPUNGED-LEVEL 5/001 CLEARANCE REQUIRED]&#34; hide=&#34;[CREDENTIALS ACCEPTED]&#34;]]

Immediately after the file was saved, SCP-682 disappeared from its chamber at exactly 11 a.m. on 28 May 2012. For the 6 hours following this incident, constant screaming and pleas for mercy were audible throughout the site. The voice was identified as that of the late Dr. Mary Nakayama&#39;s. At exactly 13:00 p.m., [[[SCP-343]]] spontaneously disappeared from their chamber. At exactly [NULL], [[[SCP-173]]] disappeared from their chamber. A message which read &#34;//Wikidot has been hit by hackers and all traces lead to Russian Federation. The data seem intact, but hackers left quite a mess. We need to scan literally everything to make sure Wikidot is secure before re-enabling it... It will take a while... Will keep you posted!//&#34; manifested on the wall of SCP-173&#39;s containment chamber, written in [Data Lost]. 

At 17:00 p.m., SCP-682 reappeared, not having suffered any harm. Screaming was replaced with soft weeping which completely ceased after 3 hours. At [NULL], SCP-173 reappeared, and the message demanifested. At 20:00 p.m., SCP-343 reappeared, hands covered in blood. When questioned, he replied: &#34;Sorry, had to deal with someone. She&#39;s usually very calm but does not know what to do when panicked. Often acts very hastily when making decisions. I pity her, honestly.&#34; and refused to comment further.

All information in the SCP-001 slot was found to have been deleted after the incident concluded. All edits were reversed. The incident was later investigated by the Pataphysics Department. The results of this investigation indicated that there was no physical evidence of Mary Nakayama ever existing, even though many individuals (including multiple Foundation employees, her family members and numerous civilians) were able to recall memories including her. Further investigation is not advised.

**Item:** [[[SCP-6871]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** Tissue sample was completely erased from baseline reality. The rest of SCP-682&#39;s body mass remained unaffected.

**Termination Test Record:** Please see the following excerpt from 6871&#39;s testing logs.

||~ Test Number ||~ Person Conducting ||~ Item of Removal ||~ Result ||

**Item:** [[[SCP-6999]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** N/A

**Termination Test Record:** SCP-682 was exposed to SCP-6999 with hopes that this would serve to comfort it and/or render it non-hostile. Instead, after listening to the entirety of SCP-6999&#39;s audio, SCP-682 did not react except for letting out a sinister and barely audible &#34;laugh&#34;.

Later that day, music began playing in 682&#39;s containment zone. Personnel hearing the music reported extreme levels of calmness and comfort. After 3 minutes, every personnel within hearing range collapsed on the ground, having fallen asleep. MTF Nu-7 (&#34;Hammer Down&#34;) was alerted after 2 hours of no contact with Site-[REDACTED]. SCP-682 was found resting in its holding tank, not having awoken. 43% of the Site&#39;s personnel population were found deceased while the rest were found in either a state of REM sleep or comatose. 

No structure damage was observed by MTF Nu-7. It is unknown if SCP-682 managed to breach containment during the time of lost contact and neither is the cause of death for deceased personnel. Interviews with affected personnel were inconclusive and SCP-682 refused to cooperate regarding this manner. However, one information worthy of note is that when questioned, SCP-682 expressed satisfaction regarding this manner by stating that it was the &#34;best sleep [it] had had since centuries ago&#34;.

**Item:** [[[SCP-3515]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** N/A

**Termination Test Record:** SCP-682 was transferred to a containment chamber located next to another cell containing SCP-3515 in order to bring it into 3515&#39;s area of effect. After 72 hours, SCP-682 curled up on the ground and fell asleep, at which point it disappeared. The following excerpt details the events which followed SCP-682&#39;s disappearance.

&gt; **&lt;72:21:43&gt;** SCP-682 disappears from its chamber.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;72:23:09&gt;** The site experiences a minor seismic incident. The incident does not prompt any further investigation and is dismissed.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;75:09:21&gt;** Every light source throughout the site goes out. This site wide shortage prompts panic among personnel.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;76:04:32&gt;** Agents are dispatched to the location of interest 3515-01 to receive updates on SCP-682.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;76:34:42&gt;** The location is surveyed and no abnormalities are found. Agents are ordered to remain on standby for possible sighting of SCP-682.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;80:45:12&gt;** Power restored on site.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;80:45:12&gt;** An extremely loud groaning sound is reported from the agents&#39; location, coming from underground. 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;80:47:23&gt;** The ground experiences a major seismic event, causing damage to the area.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;80:53:41&gt;** The branches of a tree-like plant life protrude from the ground beneath the house found at location 3515-01 and attack agents.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;81:02:07&gt;** The branches capture all personnel, and retreat into the ground.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;81:02:07&gt;** Camera feed captured by agents go static and GPS devices become unresponsive. Only a soft digging sound is audible by the agents&#39; attached mics. 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;81:42:07&gt;** The digging sound is replaced with SCP-682&#39;s groaning. Camera feed comes back, showing the entrance to the house. SCP-682 emerges from the ground, showing massive physical trauma from being repeatedly hit by hard objects.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;81:42:10&gt;** SCP-682 attempts to escape but is held back by branches clutching at its flesh and tearing pieces.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;81:43:12&gt;** The tree branches impale SCP-682&#39;s back and violently extract its spine. This piece of extracted bone is thrown away and SCP-682 is pulled back into the ground.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;85:52:01&gt;** SCP-682&#39;s spine is recovered.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;87:47:09&gt;** A mass of thousands of tree branches suddenly protrude from the concrete surface of the Foundation Site and loudly snap and break into two pieces of equal size. The branches release SCP-682 into the site, and retreat back into the ground.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;88:13:41&gt;** SCP-682 is incapacitated and collected. SCP-3515 was found hanging from one of the walls of the suburban house located in site 3515-01, having disappeared from the observation cell. SCP-3515 is retrieved without further incident.

**Item:** [[[SCP-1529]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** N/A

**Termination Test Record:** Due to a blizzard occurring in the region, the low visibility levels, a lack of hikers, and present sightings of SCP-1529 allowed for an impromptu termination test of SCP-682 without any risk to the Veil. SCP-682 was transported via helicraft near the northeast ridge of Mt. Everest, where recent sightings of SCP-1529 were reported. Once it was confirmed where SCP-1529 was located, MTF Delta-14 “Winter Wonderland” was used to lure it to where SCP-682 was. The MTF then subsequently stayed present during the entire test.

&gt; **&lt;00:00:00&gt;** Cameras and microphones set up in the area are activated and recording.
&gt;      
&gt; **&lt;00:01:03&gt;** SCP-682 sniffs the air, and subsequently begins walking towards SCP-1529&#39;s location. At the same time, SCP-1529, which was previously in an inactive state, rears its head in the direction of SCP-682, and begins walking towards it.
&gt;             
&gt; **&lt;00:02:01&gt;** Both parties are now face to face, and SCP-682 roars at SCP-1529 before charging at it. Once it gets close, SCP-1529 makes eye contact with SCP-682. This causes SCP-682 to stop charging, freeze in place, and lie down in the snow. All the while, SCP-682 is shaking violently.
&gt;          
&gt; **&lt;00:02:23&gt;** As SCP-1529 gets close, SCP-682 regains itself, and slowly stands back up. It then roars at SCP-1529, before charging at it again. SCP-1529 dodges, before attempting to jump onto its back. This attempt fails as SCP-682 shakes it off, and before SCP-1529 can regain its balance, it is eaten by SCP-682. SCP-682 then begins to produce icicles that pierce its skin, and SCP-682 is subsequently rendered immobile. 

MTF Delta-14 “Winter Wonderland” subsequently transported SCP-682 back to its container, and it was transferred back to its containment chamber via helicraft. SCP-682 fully recovered after 2 weeks, although it was sneezing heavily throughout this period.

Approximately two days after the test, a similar individual matching SCP-1529&#39;s appearance was spotted on Mt. Everest. The test is deemed a failure. 

**Notes:** //A proposed reason for SCP-682&#39;s immunity to SCP-1529&#39;s hypnotic effects would be its high CRV value, and previous adaptations against physic abilities. - Dr. Weistess//

**Item:** [[[SCP-2318]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** SCP-2318 traveled for 1700 km and reached a peak velocity of [DATA EXPUNGED] before making contact with the tissue sample, reducing the sample to fine dust.

**Termination Test Record:** Dr. Chair is instructed to hit SCP-2318 with a golf club from Site-57, which is located approximately 2400 km away from SCP-682&#39;s containment site. Instead of traveling to the location of SCP-682 as expected, SCP-2318 traveled to the location of Dr. ████&#39;s private quarters, resulting in one casualty.

The test was repeated with D-3331, again from Site-57. D-3331 was instructed to focus his thoughts on SCP-682 and its containment site&#39;s location, with disobedience punishable by termination. SCP-2318 proceeded to travel to the location of D-3331&#39;s former residence in Montgomery, Alabama, the US; which was located ████ km away from the location of Site-57. SCP-2318 was recovered from this location with ██ civilian casualties and [REDACTED] dollars worth of property damage. 

Due to the costly nature of the subsequent cover-up operation conducted by Foundation operatives, it is currently presumed that SCP-2318 is unable to &#39;detect&#39; SCP-682 and further testing is forbidden. SCP-682 later made several remarks which insinuated that it was aware of the termination attempt described above, although it is currently unknown if SCP-2318 &#39;ignoring&#39; SCP-682 was a deliberately engineered incident or was purely coincidental.

**Tissue Test Record:** N/A

**Termination Test Record:** D-4040 was instructed to follow the lesson plans of SCP-5094 after it was given the lesson prompt: &#34;Best ways to permanently kill SCP-682&#34;. As the lesson was about to begin, the CD-ROM, as well as all other electronic devices located in Site-17 shut off, allowing for the containment breach of [REDACTED]. Analysis of the affected electronic devices revealed signs of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP). There are now thirty eight (38) operable copies of SCP-5094.
**Notes:** //It is unsure where or what caused SCP-682 to develop an EMP adaptation, or how it was aware of the presence of SCP-5094.//

**Item:** [[[SCP-5094]]], second attempt, located at Site-49 encased within a triple-layer aluminium Faraday cage.

**Tissue Test Record:** N/A

**Termination Test Record:** D-4040 was instructed to follow the same process as the first termination attempt; however, as the lesson was about to begin, the display had locked its frame before it deactivated. D-4040 later suffered severe burns and scalding. Subsequent analysis inside the Faraday cage structure showed that the CD-ROM had transformed into a liquid state at 13000 Kelvin (K).
There are now thirty seven (37) operable copies of SCP-5094
**Notes:** //Further cross-testing with SCP-682 and SCP-5094 has been suspended to obviate losing another instance of SCP-5094 or another containment breach//

**Item:** [[[SCP-7122]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** Tissue sample was photographed using SCP-7122. The photograph was deleted. No effect was observed.

**Termination Test Record:** 

||~ Attempt # ||~ Subject(s) ||~ Description and results ||
|| Attempt 1 || SCP-682 || Subject was photographed using SCP-7122. The photograph was deleted. Over the course of less than 5 seconds, subject underwent and healed from over 1500 different forms of physical mutilation and various other fatal incidents; including combustion, disembowelment, cardiac arrest, [DATA EXPUNGED], fourth-degree burns, [DATA EXPUNGED] and unprecedented skull trauma due to the subject&#39;s brain expanding. After 5 seconds, subject&#39;s brain rapidly expanded in size to constitute over 60% of the subject&#39;s body mass, completely destroying the skull and rendering the subject immobile. Neural scans showed that subject had ceased all life function. D Class personnel were sent into the chamber to collect the subject&#39;s body. Upon making physical contact, the subject&#39;s brain exploded with great force, killing all personnel present. Subject then regenerated two seperate brains, both attached to one half of the subject&#39;s nerve system. Subject appeared confused, attempted to breach and failed due to both of its brains acting on their own accord. As a result, subject was violently torn into two parts of different sizes. The smaller part collapsed on the ground and expired while the larger piece of mass regenerated into a full SCP-682. The deceased section of subject&#39;s biological mass was retrieved for study. ||
|| Attempt 2 || SCP-682 || Subject was photographed using SCP-7122. Subject&#39;s .ano file&#39;s metadata was erased. Subject ceased nearly all motor functions in every part of its body except for the eyes, which began surveying the area frantically. Subject did not show any changes for 3 hours and D Class personnel were sent into the chamber to collect the subject. All personnel who were sent into the chamber appeared to get attacked and mauled by an unseen entity. For the following two weeks, the mauled subjects&#39; mutilated bodies could be observed levitating in the chamber and appeared to be undergoing a digestion process. Subject&#39;s metadata was reuploaded to their .ano file, upon which point the subject regained its previous motor functions and attempted to breach its containment. ||
|| Attempt 3 || SCP-682 and a domestic cat (Felis catus) || Both subjects were individually photographed using SCP-7122. SCP-682&#39;s and the cat&#39;s metadatas were swapped. As expected; SCP-682 became docile while the cat became sapient and aggressive. The cat was contained with ease after it attacked nearby researchers and attempted to maul them. SCP-682 adopted the behavior of a standard house cat and became conveniently tameable and docile. SCP-682 continued displaying this behavior for nearly 2 weeks. During this time; SCP-682 was observed to gradually regain its previous memories and intelligence, returning to its previous hostile behavior within several weeks of the test. The cat on the other hand, did not show any changes in behavior and had to be euthanized by Foundation researchers. It is unknown if SCP-682 somehow managed to alter the cat&#39;s consciousness or erase it completely. ||
|| Attempt 4 || SCP-682 and D-11232 || Testing denied by the Ethics Committee, given the results of attempt 3. ||

**Item:** [[[SCP-033]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** The entire content of SCP-033 was carved on the tissue sample using laser cutters. Within 780 seconds, the sample was reduced to a mixture of water and pulp-like substance.

**Termination Test Record:** SCP-033 incribed on SCP-682&#39;s skin using laser cutters. All paper-like substances within 30 meters were removed for safe testing. Observation begins.

//80 seconds:// SCP-682 becomes visibly distressed. The content of SCP-033 starts to progressively fade.

//160 seconds:// SCP-682 begins to claw at its back using its front limbs. SCP-682 appears to be bothered. The composition of SCP-682&#39;s skin is unchanged.

//320 seconds:// SCP-682&#39;s orifices appear to be producing sweat. --This is the first instance of SCP-682&#39;s body producing waste material.-- (observation pending confirmation) SCP-682 becomes infuriated and moans in pain.

//640 seconds:// SCP-682&#39;s orifices start to bleed profusely. SCP-682 roars and rolls on to its back, trying to ease the pain. SCP-682 rolls back to its feet and vomits blood.

//1280 seconds:// SCP-682&#39;s skin begins to shred off due to intense bleeding. SCP-682 begins vomiting blood profusely, covers its belly using its forelimbs and collapses on the ground. SCP-682 is moaning loudly, appearing to be in great agony.

//2560 seconds:// SCP-682 has been reduced to a pile of blood, sweat, broken bones and flesh. SCP-033 has disappeared. SCP-682 begins to regenerate.

//2654 seconds:// SCP-682&#39;s body adapts and assumes the typical dimensions of an 033-Safe surface. SCP-682 has difficulties moving due to its new shape.

//2731 seconds:// SCP-033&#39;s content begins to appear on the western wall of the chamber. The chamber is immediately filled with acid to incapacitate SCP-682.

//2738 seconds:// SCP-033&#39;s content begins to appear on the ground of the chamber. The chamber experiences a structural integrity failure.

//2739 seconds:// The chamber collapses on itself, debris falling on to SCP-682. SCP-682 falls to the lower floor. SCP-682 attacks nearby personnel, and any surfaces touched by SCP-682 begins to display inscriptions detailing the contents of SCP-033.

//2855 seconds:// The site broadcasts an emergency signal due to widespread anomalous structural failure. MTF Nu-7 arrives to the scene hours later and report that roughly 25% of the site&#39;s total structure has completely collapsed. SCP-682 is missing and searching efforts begin.

//11889 seconds:// Nu-7 is alerted to the reports of a severe localized earthquake of magnitude 9.8 ocurring in a small village located [REDACTED] kilometers away. It is presumed that the entire village experienced a massive infrastructure failure following the infrastructural system&#39;s forced introduction to SCP-033 via SCP-682. SCP-682 is recovered from this location and recontained hours later.

**Tissue Test Record:** N/A


**Termination Test Record:**

[[collapsible show=&#34;BY ORDER OF THE OVERSEER COUNCIL, THIS FILE IS ONLY ACCESSIBLE WITH LEVEL 5/3812 CLEARANCE&#34; hide=&#34;There is a deeper purpose to be realized, for this, and for everything.&#34;]]

SCP-682 was safely escorted to SCP-3812&#39;s containment zone in the South Pacific Ocean, without any attempt to break containment or assault Foundation personnel throughout the process.

SCP-682, at 4:49 am, was released into the water by a special Foundation marine transport vehicle, approximately 7 miles from the vertical point of SCP-3812. SCP-682 swam to SCP-3812, and arrived approximately 80 meters away from the anomaly at 5:03 am.

Both anomalies did not perform any interaction, remaining static until 5:38 am. At that moment, both SCP-682 and SCP-3812 suddenly disappeared. Subjects were not detected. By 6:27 a.m., multiple deepwell servers and ontokinetic activity monitoring devices detected the occurrence of a series of CK-Class Reality Restructuring Events, however, no notable change in reality structure was reported by any individual in baseline reality.

At 11:20 am, all deepwell servers in the Foundation&#39;s possession recorded a ZK-Class Reality Failure Event, and 4 minutes later, they were mysteriously disabled. At 11:31 am, Site-01&#39;s main server was brought back up and logged a CK-Class Restructuring Event. SCP-682 manifested in its containment chamber at the same time, but SCP-3812 did not return to its original location.

When interviewed, SCP-682 responded, in a fearful tone, as follows:

&gt; **SCP-682:** For a moment, I could feel all things, those that exist, those that don&#39;t exist, and those that transcend the need to exist. I looked down, up, but I couldn&#39;t see anything, nothing but me, and nothing but him. Because of me, all the stories were over. He and I had broken every rule that was laid down for all things, overcome all the potestates that govern this world. And then, he looked at me, and said only one thing: pain. And he left. You were no longer alive, but you weren&#39;t dead, since reality fell into shadows that go beyond the darkness itself. I almost felt that the termination had finally arrived, but unfortunately for you, I had already won from the beginning.

In-depth investigations into what happened to Foundation servers are ongoing. SCP-3812 remains undetected. SCP-682, after the interview, remained static and unresponsive for four months, making absolutely no attempt to break containment and communication. Further research led to the information that SCP-682&#39;s Hume level couldn&#39;t be measured by any Kant counter and other means of reality counting. The clear reason why this occurred is still unknown, but it is theorized that the anomaly&#39;s pataphysical ontology became similar to that of SCP-3812, although no other type of narrakinetic and ontokinetic properties were noted.

**Termination Test Record:** The following record was recovered by the Foundation from among the last remaining data from the {{[[[[unreality-hub|SITE NOT FOUND]]]]}} server before it was mysteriously removed from the structure of baseline reality. The facility housed SCP-682&#39;s former containment unit, with the anomaly being the only entity remaining after the perimeter&#39;s collapse. The exact cause of {{[SITE NOT FOUND]}} destruction is unknown and is still under investigation. SCP-682 has been safely transferred to Site-19 and is currently under provisional containment.

Shortly after the destruction of {{[SITE NOT FOUND]}}, the Department of Analytics detected a series of phenomena occurring in print and digital media, consisting of the frequent discussion of non-existent works of fiction. These phenomena were deeply investigated and were concluded to have anomalous properties, later being cataloged as SCP-2747. No direct or indirect relationship between SCP-682, SCP-2747 and what occurred at {{[SITE NOT FOUND]}} has been confirmed, even more so as the clear nature of the recording above is still debated.

**Item:** [[[SCP-5242]]] (previously ##blue|SCP-INTEGER##)

**Tissue Test Record:** N/A

**Termination Test Record:** The extermination proposal consisted of an attempt to force SCP-682 to trigger the semiohazard and infohazard effects of SCP-5242 in a way that would cause agressive reaction from the entity, with the objective not only to abstract SCP-682 and all related information, but also to possibly neutralize its properties from this. Researchers from the Department of Miscommunications have proposed that if SCP-5242 were sufficiently designated in inappropriate ways, ##blue|SCP-INTEGER## could then cause an alteration in the structure of reality that could remove any provoking entity from the timeline, including any information related to its existence.

Based on this, Dr. Nathan Valis (formerly Dr. Placeholder McDoctorate, who had been affected by SCP-5242, turning him into a ##green|SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT## instance) was sent to the monitoring cabin near SCP-682&#39;s containment cell. The objective was for the individual to be able to interview SCP-682 in a way that would induce the anomaly to cite an amount of information that would trigger an aggressive reaction from SCP-5242. The dialogue between SCP-682 and Dr. Valis initially went as expected, with the individual cautiously commenting on ##blue|SCP-INTEGER## to the anomaly. However, during the interview, SCP-682 ended up mentioning a possible &#34;true&#34; designation[[footnote]]At the request of the Department of Miscommunications, this designation will not be redacted in this entry. [[/footnote]] of SCP-5242.

SCP-682 was not affected by SCP-5242, so it continued to mention the anomaly under multiple names, with no semiohazard effect noted. Due to this, Dr. PHMD requested the anomaly to end the interview. However, SCP-682 refused the individual&#39;s request, continuing to freely speak information about ##blue|SCP-INTEGER##. During the same moment as the interview was in progress, it was realized that all records about the interviewer in the Foundation&#39;s possession had been altered, so that Dr. PHMD&#39;s real name was returned to normal. Not just him, but all the individuals who were SCP-5242-A instances. When SCP-682 finished its dialogue, Dr. Nathan Valis withdrew from the cabin and the termination attempt was given as unsuccessfull.

After the interview, observations from the Department of Miscommunications led to the conclusion that the properties of ##blue|SCP-INTEGER## have since been apparently nullfied, leading to the normalization of all information that had previously been affected. Therefore, at the time of writing, SCP-5242 can be freely referred to by this designation or any other.

**Note:** //In-depth research has led to information that not only have SCP-5242&#39;s properties apparently been nullified, but [[[taboo|SCP-4000]]]&#39;s as well. The team responsible for the research and containment of SCP-4000, in collaboration with the Department of Miscommunications, is still analyzing other possible changes in SCP-4000&#39;s anomalous properties. Protocol 4000-Eshu has been revoked and the reclassification of ##blue|SCP-INTEGER## to the Neutralized-class is still discussed.// - Dr. Eli Forkley

**Item:** [[[SCP-055-PT]]]

**Tissue Test Record:** N/A

**Termination Test Record:** During a large-scale containment breach of SCP-682 that occurred in ██/██/████, the anomaly ended up escaping until it was detected within Brazil&#39;s exclusive economic zone. The Foundation&#39;s Lusophone Branch was contacted and tasked with the mission of recovering SCP-682. Below is a record that shows the operation carried out by the Lusophone Foundation, where multiple Mobile Task Forces from this branch collaborated to ensure the anomaly in not reaching the nearest urban development zone. The use of an SCP-055-PT unit has been included.

&gt; **[BEGIN LOG]**
&gt; @@@@
&gt; [00:00:00] MTF PT10 &#34;Ministry of Truth&#34; was tasked with carrying out an evacuation operation in more than 22 municipalities located on the northeastern coast of Brazil with the narrative of a volcanic eruption occurring in the Atlantic Ocean that could result in the occurrence of a tsunami capable of hitting all coastal cities in the region.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; [02:17:49] MTF PT9 &#34;Security Section [9]&#34; was tasked with creating a 3 kilometer radius escort perimeter in relation to SCP-682&#39;s given position in the Atlantic Ocean.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; [02:33:13] An SCP-055-PT unit was deployed within the escort perimeter, with specialized technological and paratechnological equipment to contain hostile anomalies in aquatic and terrestrial environments.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; [02:35:08] SCP-055-PT tries to generate a special psionic-thaumaturgical &#34;cage&#34; with the intention of immobilizing SCP-682, but the entity ends up noticing the presence of the unit and reacts by striking SCP-055-PT in such a way that it is thrown towards an MTF PT9 escort vessel. The ship has 30% of its structure damaged, but due to the protection methods developed for the unit, SCP-055-PT does not suffer any damage.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; [02:37:24] SCP-682 advances towards SCP-055-PT&#39;s location with the intention of neutralizing the unit. PT9 escorts are ordered not to approach either SCP-682 or SCP-055-PT.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; [02:46:51] SCP-682 arrives at SCP-055-PT&#39;s location and both objects engage in direct combat.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; [03:01:18] SCP-682 and SCP-055-PT, still in combat, advance towards the bottom of the sea. The interactions remain at a depth of more than 130 meters.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; [03:04:24] Due to the frequent use of psionic and thaumaturgical energy, several energy pulses and lights were detected at the center of SCP-055-PT and SCP-682&#39;s interactions.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; [03:11:37] SCP-682, with more than 86% of its body mass compromised, is thrown towards the surface and appears to be unconscious. SCP-055-PT is approximately 75 meters deep and begins to return to the surface.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; [03:14:06] SCP-682 returns to consciousness and begins to regenerate its body mass. A series of thaumaturgical symbols were noticed along its organic structure and its eyes emitted a blinding red light.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; [03:16:00] SCP-682 attacks SCP-055-PT and begins dragging it towards the ocean floor. SCP-055-PT&#39;s operative actives the Stasis Shield. Apparently, the unit reached such a high damage state that the Oneiricweave was rendered useless. It is theorized that SCP-682&#39;s thaumaturgical symbols were beginning to nullify SCP-055-PT&#39;s resistance properties.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; [03:18:05] A blast of thaumic energy was detected at a depth of approximately 180 meters. SCP-055-PT&#39;s signature has been lost.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; [03:23:49] SCP-682 reappeared on the surface, but immobilized by an extremely durable psionic-thaumturgical net. SCP-055-PT was not detected and both the unit and the operative were considered neutralized. The Foundation captured the anomaly and it was safely returned to its original containment zone. The net deteriorated about 5 hours after recovery.
&gt; @@@@
&gt; **[END LOG]**

**Note:** //SCP-055-PT is certainly one of the best operational methods of containment under Lusophone&#39;s possession, being considered implacable in most of its missions, but knowing that it was still, in a certain way, useless against 682 leads to the conclusion that the creature is extremely resistant to thaumaturgical damages, and not only that, but it also has access to unknown thaumaturgical properties. This is honestly a scary observation. I advise my partners from the Anglophone Foundation to start digging even deeper into what this thing is capable of.// - Dr. Cezar

SCP-6101 asked researchers if there was one more sample, which was given to him. The individual then crushed the tissue with his hand, and soon after it was revealed that it had been erased from baseline reality.

**Termination Test Record:** SCP-6101 was sent to SCP-682&#39;s containment cell, and the latter reacted mockingly. SCP-6101 then drew Fear, one of his weapons, and shot SCP-682&#39;s paw, erasing it from reality, with no regeneration occurring.

The monster then realized the gravity of the situation and saw that SCP-6101 was not like the other anomalies that had been tested against it. SCP-6101 was the most powerful thing it had ever seen. SCP-682 then cried out for mercy, but SCP-6101 shot SCP-682 again, this time using Loathing, with the anomaly being erased entirely from existence.

SCP-682 has been reclassified as Neutralized. SCP-6101 received the Foundation&#39;s Highest Honor Award and the O5 Council declared SCP-682&#39;s termination day a global holiday.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ [ENTER CREDENTIALS]&#34; hide=&#34;- [ACCESS GRANTED]&#34;]]
**Termination Test Record:** The following incident transpired consequent to a containment breach during the emergency transportation of SCP-001. Researchers reported the humidity levels decreasing notably within SCP-001&#39;s containment chamber due to unidentified reasons, prompting the decision to urgently relocate SCP-001 to Site-██ for temporary containment. However, during transportation, SCP-001 managed to breach containment using a minor gap in its transport container. Subsequently, SCP-001 engaged in hostile actions, resulting in the loss of several security personnel. SCP-682, contained in the same site, displayed heightened agitation upon sensing SCP-001&#39;s presence in the facility, emitting audible signs of distress. SCP-001 was subsequently observed manifesting within SCP-682&#39;s containment chamber.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**

----

**&lt;00:00:00&gt;** SCP-682 manifests acute distress and heightened aggression upon encountering SCP-001. SCP-682 attempts physical engagement, yet its efforts prove futile as SCP-001 consistently evades through rapid speed within the containment chamber.


**&lt;00:01:15&gt;** SCP-001 manages to maneuver onto the ceiling of the containment chamber, positioning itself directly above SCP-682 and leaps onto SCP-682&#39;s dorsal area, forcefully slamming SCP-682&#39;s head against the floor. SCP-001 initiates dermal consumption on SCP-682.


**&lt;00:01:21&gt;** SCP-682 responds by utilizing its tail to dislodge SCP-001 from its back. SCP-001 grasps SCP-682&#39;s tail, attempting to ingest it.


**&lt;00:01:23&gt;** SCP-682 rapidly develops short spikes along its tail, preventing SCP-001 from engulfing it.


**&lt;00:01:25&gt;** SCP-001 releases SCP-682&#39;s tail and begins invasive entry into SCP-682&#39;s body. SCP-682 displays signs of extreme distress.


**&lt;0:01:32&gt;** SCP-682 initiates a series of body rotations in an attempt to crush SCP-001. SCP-001 evades by leaping off SCP-682&#39;s body.


**&lt;00:01:36&gt;** SCP-001 initiates gradual extraction of its &#34;eye&#34;, provoking an intense and aggressive response from SCP-682 further escalating to vehement attempts at breaching containment.


**&lt;00:01:52&gt;** SCP-001 utilizes the extracted &#34;eye&#34; to generate several singularities in the vicinity of SCP-682, facilitating teleportation while consistently inflicting damage. In response, SCP-682 initiates the protrusion of multiple appendages in an attempt to apprehend SCP-001, who subsequently disappears into one of the singularities.


**&lt;00:02:12&gt;** SCP-001 reappears within the chamber, engaging SCP-682 in a similar sequence of aggressive interactions as previously described. The altercation lasts for approximately 11 minutes before SCP-001 teleports away.


**&lt;00:15:57&gt;** SCP-001 materializes again in the containment chamber, resuming hostile actions toward SCP-682. The duration of this encounter is 9 minutes prior to SCP-001&#39;s teleportation.


**&lt;00:25:24&gt;** SCP-001 reappears for the third instance, initiating confrontation with SCP-682. The repeated pattern of aggressive behavior is observed, lasting for 13 minutes before SCP-001 vanishes once more.


**&lt;00:49:09&gt;** SCP-001 materializes within the chamber after the recurring series of disappearances and reappearances. This time, it remains present within the containment area.


**&lt;00:50:49&gt;** Despite SCP-682&#39;s retaliatory efforts, SCP-001 maintains dominance, teleporting SCP-682 to an undisclosed location via a singularity created by its &#34;eye&#34;.


**&lt;02:45:55&gt;** Following an absence of approximately 2 hours, both entities reappear within the containment chamber. SCP-682 is exibiting an alarming 89.7 percent reduction in total body mass, accompanied by severe symptoms consistent with radiation poisoning. These effects seemed to drastically compromise SCP-682&#39;s regenerative capabilities, indicating a significant deviation from its typical anomalous resistance.



**&lt;02:46:05&gt;** SCP-001 is observed positioned atop SCP-682 but abruptly collapses into an unconscious state shortly after their reappearance.

**&lt;END LOG&gt;**
[[/div]]

Following the encounter, both SCP-682 and SCP-001 were successfully recontained without incident.

Subsequent to the containment, SCP-682 displayed an atypical absence of regeneration over the ensuing 48-hour period. Notably, SCP-001 was temporarily contained at the same facility during this timeframe. Upon SCP-001&#39;s relocation to its former containment site, SCP-682 commenced its gradual regeneration process, displaying signs of recovery subsequent to SCP-001&#39;s departure.


**Notes:** //The radiation emitted by SCP-001 appeared to have inflicted extensive damage to SCP-682&#39;s regenerative tissues, potentially rendering it vulnerable to interventions. Considering this vulnerability, a strategically planned crosstest between the two might yield favorable results. However, success hinges upon SCP-682&#39;s lack of complete adaptation to the radioactive effects inflicted by SCP-001.// – Dr. Alexander Avenlee, Site-██.

**Tissue Test Record:** N/A, Overridden by O5 Council.

**Termination Test Record:** It should be noted that there is only a 2.27% (best estimate) chance that this termination test actually occurred.

A hardware pseudo-random number generator with an unknown output range was connected to a standard laptop computer, which was connected to a standard projector. In the event a specific number was chosen, the laptop would immediately access a secure Foundation sever, load infohazardous data regarding SCP-4885&#39;s location, and project it on the wall of SCP-682&#39;s chamber.

After evacuation of the observation chamber, a pseudo-random time generator was connected to the first pseudo-random number generator. At the start of the test, the pseudo-random time generator created a specific and private UTC timecode sometime in the next 24 hours. Once the current time exceeded that timecode, the pseudo-random time generator would activate the pseudo-random number generator, which would then perform one generation.

After 24 hours, Procedure Invient Eum was enacted, and SCP-4885 was theorized to have been recontained. SCP-682 appeared identical to before.
