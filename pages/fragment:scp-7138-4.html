**Item #:** SCP-7138

**Object Class:** ##dark green|Apollyon##
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** ##green|Special Containment Procedures: Given the nature of SCP-7138, standard containment is impossible. Instead, field agents will infiltrate institutions related to the visual arts, such as colleges of art, museums, and art cooperatives. These agents will then attempt to discourage the use of SCP-7138 in visual art.##

##green|Additionally, MTF Theta-57 (&#34;The Critters&#34;) are to integrate themselves into society under the cover of professional art critics. If an artist or group of artists begins to use too much SCP-7138 in their art, MTF Theta-57 will be deployed to utilize their status as respected members of the art community to pressure the artist or artists into stopping.##

##green|If an artist continues to utilize SCP-7138 in their work after the deployment of MTF Theta-57, then the artist is to be taken into custody, amnestized, and relocated. ##

##green|If a person experiences SCP-7138’s anomalous effects, they are to be taken into Foundation custody for further study.##

##green|Due to the events caused by research into SCP-7138[[footnote]]See Incident 7138-1[[/footnote]], all investigations into its nature are suspended until further notice. The cause of SCP-7138&#39;s anomalous effects is to be removed from all relevant documentation. All personnel reading this file or assigned to SCP-7138 must also read Notice-7138-1, included below.##

**Description:** ##green|SCP-7138 is a collection of electromagnetic wavelengths visible to the human eye. These wavelengths manifest to humans as the color magenta. Using hexadecimal color representation, SCP-7138 has a value at or near #FF00FF.##

##green|The cause of SCP-7138&#39;s anomalous effects has been excluded from this document as per special containment procedures.##

**Discovery:** ##green|SCP-7138 was discovered during research carried out by Subject 7138-E – formerly known as Dr. Montgomery – on a painting that had led several members of AWCY? to experience SCP-7138’s anomalous effects.##

##green|The painting has been destroyed.##

**Notice 7138-1:**

Hello,

Yes. SCP-7138 is a color. [[[SCP-6996|It’s not the only one]]], and no, we don’t know if there are more we haven’t discovered.

You might be wondering when you&#39;ll be told how SCP-7138&#39;s effects are triggered.

You won&#39;t be.

If you think you&#39;ve figured it out, report to the dispensary for a dose of amnestics.

Anyone who is found to be investigating SCP-7138&#39;s cause or who refuses amnestics after discovering the cause of SCP-7138 will be amnestized and reassigned immediately.

Don&#39;t think too hard about it. Just keep going.

Sincerely,
Carl Blanden,
Director of Site ██
