**From the Editorial Desk -**

The SCP-Wiki is entirely run by volunteers. Without the tireless effort of many unsung and unnoticed volunteers, the site we all love and use (often daily) would cease to function. It is easy for Staff to disappear into our own little areas and just chug away at the minutia that makes this site work. As such, it&#39;s easy to see how there can be a disconnect between the Staff and the community we serve. It isn&#39;t always apparent to the general community the incredible amount of work that goes into keeping this site functional, and it is easy for Staff to miss trends and flows swirling through the broader community.

In an effort to address this disconnect, Staff has been involved in on-going conversation with several different sections of the broader SCP-Wiki community. Out of these conversations has been born the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/c-7270124/town-halls Town Hall Project]. Over the coming months this forum will be open to the broader community in an effort to provide a bridge between the many different areas of the Wiki community. The hope is that this will allow the community a place to talk directly to staff and note their concerns / wants / criticisms. It will give staff a place to interface with the community and hopefully address/respond to those concerns. 

Without conversation and communication, nothing can change. Nothing can exist long in a vacuum and hope to grow and adapt to the changing world around us. Even so, it is important to remember that as we move forward with this initiative, that everyone remember that we are all people, human beings with lives and concerns that exist outside of this community. No matter how difficult some of the conversations that need to happen become, it is good to remind ourselves that we all care a great deal about this site and where we go in the future.

You will notice little &#39;📈&#39; emojis beside some articles. That denotes SCP articles which were under 30 and tales which were under 20 when this edition of site news was posted. Give them a little love! Speaking from personal experience, the most frustrating thing that can happen to an article is not deletion, but stagnating below 20 without any comments. So try to read, vote, and comment on these articles! They&#39;re often hidden gems :)

[[tab Staff Team Spotlight]]
**April spotlight:** [http://05command.wikidot.com/disciplinary-main The Disciplinary Committee]
**Featuring:** DrEverettMann
**Interviewer:** MalyceGraves

------

**Interview:**
Thank you for interviewing with me today about the Disciplinary Committee! Do you mind giving me a brief overview of the team? What role it plays in the site administration, and maybe something you view as an accomplishment the team has done?

&gt; Disciplinary is the rules enforcement branch of staff. We&#39;re responsible for making sure that behavior that is in breach of the rules is addressed, whether through warnings, short bans, or permanent bans. We prevent disruptive or abusive users from taking a way from our user&#39;s ability to write and create on the wiki, or to enjoy the things others have created. It&#39;s not fun, but it&#39;s satisfying to see people able to enjoy the site despite others trying to keep them from doing so. It&#39;s also satisfying when someone realizes that their behavior was wrong and makes an effort to fix it. In general, we would much rather someone fix their behavior before the ban step comes in.

So, you would say that Disc tries to take a &#34;reform&#34; approach rather than a &#34;punishment&#34; one, when it can?

&gt; When possible, when we believe it&#39;s simply a misunderstanding of the rules, or behavior we think can be fixed. There are some actions that are given an immediate permanent ban, such as harassment, vandalism, or plagiarism. We have to keep a balance between keeping the site working for other users and helping those willing to improve on the site.
How do you fit into the team? As in, could you share with me a bit of what you do, personally?

&gt; Like other members of Disc, I take reports from members, and we discuss these together. We try to examine cases both from a legalistic standpoint (does this, in fact, break any rules we have established) and a pragmatic standpoint (is this actually hurting people). We&#39;ll discuss things among ourselves and decide what action needs to be taken. I like to think that one of the things I personally bring to the team is experience. I&#39;ve been staff on the wiki for most of its lifetime, and how policy has changed in that time. I can look at how similar behavior has escalated or de-escalated in the past and make recommendations based on that.
&gt; I also got to call the mother of a troll once to let her know what her son had been doing. That was pretty great.

I bet that conversation wasn&#39;t what she was expecting at all. Are there parts of the job that you find less pleasant than others? Has that changed over time, given your long history with the site?

&gt; Some parts are never pleasant. Sometimes, someone you got along well with just isn&#39;t able to play by the rules. A lot of older users had trouble getting used to a site where they weren&#39;t allowed to flame newbies. It sucked having to enforce the rules against them, but we had to do it to help the site grow and make it more than just a good old boys club. Also, sometimes people you think are great turn out to be awful in ways you never expected. You have to be able to deal with that in Disc. The former has changed a bit as most of the older users have either adapted or left, but the latter is always going to be an issue.

I can imagine. It can&#39;t be easy having to deal with that, day in and day out, so what keeps you involved in the Team? I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen a lot of turnover, but you&#39;ve stayed. Why?

&gt; For one thing, admins are pretty much automatically in Disc. For another, it&#39;s something I&#39;m somewhat good at, and I get satisfaction when the job goes well. And when it doesn&#39;t, well, I think it&#39;s important to try and fix things. We&#39;re not perfect in Disc, but we&#39;ve got to keep trying to improve. I wouldn&#39;t be able to do that if I left.

Does that tie in with why you&#39;re still around on the site? You&#39;ve watched it grow a great deal and a lot of the &#34;old guard&#34; have moved on for various reasons. What keeps you coming back?

&gt; I love the site. I love our community. I love how much it&#39;s grown and improved. I keep meeting people outside of the wiki who know about us, and I get to tell them I&#39;m one of the people who keeps it running. That&#39;s pretty great.

My last question is in two parts: First, do you have any advice for new staffers or people just getting into staff? And, more broadly, do you have any advice for users who just want to get more out of their experience on the site, but aren&#39;t interested in joining staff?

&gt; For the first, communication and trust are both key. If you don&#39;t understand something, by all means ask. But also understand that sometimes there are things we can&#39;t talk about, either because there are other peoples&#39; sensitive information involved, or because there are things we&#39;re not quite ready to share. We&#39;re all trying to help the site, so please try not to get frustrated at the parts you can&#39;t see.
&gt; For the second, there are a lot of things that users can do. The biggest is just writing. SCPs, tales, whatever you think is great. Reading things other people have posted and commenting on it is huge as well. You can also do things off-site. Start a podcast. Make videos on youtube. Draw SCPs. These are all ways you can try to make your mark on the community.

++++* __Updates from 05 Command:__

Moderator Elenee FishTruck began the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14041263/team-restructuring-published-works-review-and-discussion-tea Published Works Review and Discussion Team] proposal. This would introduce a restructuring of our current and mostly inactive [http://05command.wikidot.com/site-crit-main Site Criticism] team. This new PWRD team would &#34;endeavor to engender discussion of any given &#34;finished&#34; work&#39;s voteable elements and moderate or shepherd that discourse&#34;. The proposal was met with a positive reception from staff. Further steps are currently in the works.

Moderator taylor_itkin started the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14046085/proposal-town-halls Town Halls] proposal which was brought forward to open a more transparent and direct route of communication between the staff team and the user base of the wiki in regards to policy and site content. Originally, the proposal was to host Town Hall meetings over our IRC network; however, this was decided against and the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14063360/proposal-town-halls-part-2 Town Halls Part 2] proposal came to be which suggested we utilize the forums instead. This idea was met with support and later unanimous approval from the 29 staff members who voted in the related [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14064510/voting-thread-town-halls voting thread].

Administrator DrBleep started the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14062132/harassment-team-ban-reasons-update Harassment Team Ban Reasons Update] discussion regarding an update to [http://05command.wikidot.com/harassment-main Harassment] team policy. To quote, &#34;In the name of transparency and to correct recent issues with community perception, and to ensure that bad actors can no longer take advantage of a lack of information being provided, AHT is looking to revise the way it announces harassment bans. To do this we would like to add the following to the AHT policy.&#34; After discussion of the proposed changes and some improvements which were enacted, the proposal was met with unanimous support and was enacted.

Moderator MalyceGraves brought forward the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14063367/proposal-defining-vandalism Defining Vandalism] proposal to address the need to define exactly what vandalism is in the Site Rules. After discussion, the proposal moved to the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14069912/voting-thread-defining-vandalism voting phase] where it was passed with 20 staff members unanimously approving of the changes.

Administrator DrBleep brought to everyone&#39;s attention that the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14064725/collections-team Collections Team] which was previously a subteam of [http://05command.wikidot.com/community-outreach-main Community Outreach] had been moved to the [http://05command.wikidot.com/maintenance-and-ancillary-staff-team-main Maintenance and Ancillary Staff Team] as its goals aligned more with MAST and that MAST has more resources in terms of manpower to afford to them.

Moderator TheMightyMcB brought forward the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14067250/archiving-the-expert-witnesses-guide Archiving the Expert Witnesses Guide]. This was an old guide of a bygone era and staff decided to go ahead and delete the page rather than archival.

Administrator Dexanote opened up the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14079891/administrator-promotion-thread-april-2021 Administrator Promotion Thread - April 2021] with the intention of having aismallard and TSATPWTCOTTTADC be promoted to Administrator. The vote ended with unanimous votes in approval, so please welcome our new Administrators!

Moderator MalyceGraves started the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14080547/proposal-updates-to-the-appeals-process Updates to the Appeals process] proposal after a discussion had ensued about clarifying our appeals process. It is poorly defined in the site rules and it is set up in a way that some users have claimed is frustrating and unwieldy. The proposal has been met with a positive reception from staff thus far.

+* Q&amp;A:

++++* Q: Can I replace a blurb that you wrote for one of my articles with my own? I&#39;m not satisfied with it.

A: Absolutely. You will always have that option at any point.

++++* Q: I noticed an error/typo/incorrect information and wish to correct it. May I?

A: Sure! If the changes are not limited to your own article(s) and/or are substantial changes across multiple entries, you should post in that month&#39;s discussion page and then make the changes.

++++* Q: I wrote an article and it seems to have stuck. Can I send a blurb of mine to one of the frequent collaborators?

A: Yup! It&#39;s much easier if you come to us about it, and it gives you the control over what you want shown on the news page.
