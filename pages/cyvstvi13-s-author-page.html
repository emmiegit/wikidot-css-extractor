++ __**About Cyvstvi:**__

I joined the site during my first year of university during the SCP-5000 contest. Following my entry into the contest, I chose to became fully invested within the community owing to the circumstantial circumstances of absolute and utter boredom.

Whilst I must admit that my articles normally find themselves engaging with the historical, the horrific, and the //corps grotesquerie//, I am attempting to branch out into more varied topics. If you choose to descend into my works, you might just find something you enjoy yourself.

[[tab Series 1 - The Early Years]]
A compilation of my earliest works, dating from across Series VI; all nice and neatly stored in one place for your viewing pleasures and conveniences. Whilst I&#39;m quite proud of these works, I feel that they each lack a certain element of composure, elegance, or imagination.

Think of them as products of the learning process: an extremely long, incomprehensibly convoluted and impossibly indescribable process.
