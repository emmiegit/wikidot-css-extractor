**Item #:** SCP-3146

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation agents embedded in the professional gaming community are to make posts on social media during Y-Manifestation events at locations already designated to be “gaming”, “anime” or “comics” conventions, purporting to be the event’s organizers. The overall tone of these posts is to suggest that SCP-3146 has a niche fanbase and is no longer in production as its parent company is defunct. In the event that a Y-Manifestation event has not naturally occurred in a public venue in over six (6) months, embedded Foundation agents are to stage an SCP-3146 tournament in a professional gaming event venue, whether on the official stage or on any improvised surface available.

If a Y-Manifestation event affects political figures without sufficient clearance or allyship to the Foundation, they are to be subjected to surreptitious Class-C amnestic treatment by embedded Foundation agents in federal law enforcement agencies dedicated to protecting political figures.

**Description:** SCP-3146 is a video game by the name of “Magical Hearts XX: Upgrade Ultimate ~EXTENSION~ DESTROYER Ascend!”. SCP-3146 is found only in Blu-Ray disc format, and is playable only on PlayStation 3 consoles. Discs bearing SCP-3146 have only been found during Y-Manifestation events.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Show SCP-3146 gameplay description&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide SCP-3146 gameplay description&#34;]]
“Magical Hearts XX: Upgrade Ultimate ~EXTENSION~ DESTROYER Ascend!” is a two-dimensional, one-on-one fighting game. Players are presented with a screen bearing the name of the game and the text “50% of proceeds to go charity!”, after which the game cuts to a selection screen featuring 16 characters. Players then try to make each other’s character reach 0 health first utilizing a variety of attacks assisted by several “meters” they can spend; for example, the &#34;Special&#34; meter allows them to perform flashy &#34;super&#34; attacks, while the &#34;EXPLODE&#34; meter allows them to stop an enemy offensive. The first player to bring their enemy down to zero health twice wins the match. 

The game&#39;s single-player &#34;story&#34; mode follows the story of Haku Kei, a young man with the power of the &#34;Magical Heart&#34;, which allows him to discern the intent of any person he comes across. Kei goes on a journey to end the tyranny of Arimas, the game&#39;s titular villain, who plans to absorb the souls of all humans, and in the way fights against or allies himself with an eclectic cast of characters (most of which are available in the player-versus-player mode), such as Jeanne, a dual-sword wielding nun, and Accel, a motorcycle driver fond of American cowboy culture. The game is available in English and Japanese.

Any public event attended by over 200 individuals carries a chance of triggering a Y-Manifestation event. Y-Manifestation events begin with the evacuation of the event’s venue due to emergency reasons (reasons reported so far have included fire alarms, minor earthquakes, electrical hazards, gas leaks and [REDACTED] containment breach)[[footnote]] Whether Y-Manifestation events trigger or are triggered by the related emergency is under investigation. [[/footnote]]. Once the building has been evacuated, a number of PlayStation 3 consoles bearing SCP-3146  materialize in the vicinity of the emergency assembly point, all powered on and connected to a portable battery and a television. For the duration of a Y-Manifestation event, SCP-3146 instances manifest the following anomalous properties[[footnote]] SCP-3146 instances recovered by interrupting Y-Manifestation events display no anomalous properties outside the event, and can be safely replicated into other non-anomalous copies. [[/footnote]]:

* Subjects attending the event experience a moderate compulsion to play SCP-3146.
* Subjects attending the event become capable of materializing assets that they own but were not physically carrying, such as money from a bank account.

Subjects affected by SCP-3146 will then organize a double-elimination bracket tournament with an entry fee believed to be directly proportional to the assets available to the average attendee. Once the tournament has run its course, 50% of the money pooled will be awarded to the tournament’s top 8 competitors, then the Y-Manifestation will end with the disappearance of all hardware, including SCP-3146 discs, and the remaining 50% of the pooled money. Subjects affected by the Y-Manifestation event will recall the event as an out-of-the-ordinary but not worrisome “break” from the main event, and regard it as a generally positive time. No attempts from the event&#39;s losers to recover the lost money have been recorded once anomalous effects have ended, although altercations have been recorded in at least four instances.

███ Y-Manifestation events have been recorded[[footnote]]3 of which have occurred during Foundation meetings.[[/footnote]], and caused $████████ in damages.

//Video recovered from the personal smartphone of █████ after a Y-Manifestation event triggered during an evacuation of Anime Expo 20██. Video feed shows two individuals sitting on the ground in front of a console-display setup containing an instance of SCP-3146, with a large pile of money on top of the table. A small crowd is visible around them. Agent Mendoza, in his guise as professional commentator &#34;Jumps&#34;, can be heard narrating off-screen.// 

&gt; **Mendoza:** Oh he got the slide, but is he takin&#39; it?
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject 1 has forced Subject 2 to the right corner of the screen and forced them into a defensive position for an extended period of time. Subject 2 is at a considerable health disadvantage.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Mendoza:** He&#39;s takin&#39; it, oh he&#39;s-
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject 2 initiates a counteroffensive, chaining together a long &#34;combo&#34; of attacks. Subject 1 can be seen pressing buttons at random, which have no effect on his character&#39;s state or interrupt Subject 2&#39;s combo. The crowd&#39;s cheering increases considerably.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Mendoza:** Baby&#39;s //not// takin&#39; it! Oh, the comeback, son, is it gonna be enough, though?
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject 2&#39;s combo ends in a lengthy &#34;super&#34; animation. Certain members of the crowd mimic the character&#39;s movements, while others clap. Subject 1 taps her leg while waiting for the animation to end; once it does, Subject 1 is now at a health disadvantage.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Mendoza:** It&#39;s not enough, but ohh, here comes the mixup!
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject 1 performs an attack as soon as her &#34;wakeup&#34; animation allows her to. Subject 2 blocks it and performs her own attack, ending the match. Subject 2 rises to her feet and is embraced by the cheering crowd.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Mendoza:** Come on, baby, wakeup Sky Smash and you thought it was gonna work? This ain&#39;t Lay&#39;s, baby, ██████ ate &#39;em all!
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject 1 gets up and faces Subject 2.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject 1:** (//unintelligible//) another?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mendoza:** Oh she&#39;s gotta be salty after that, you know she wants the runba-
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject 2 shrugs; Subject 1 throws her controller to the ground and assaults Subject 2. The camera shakes as it is moved around. Analysis reveals the crowd, including Agent Mendoza, trying to break up the altercation; in the background, the money on the table dematerializes.//
