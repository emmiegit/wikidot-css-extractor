**Item #:** SCP-2596

**Object Class:** Euclid (previously Safe) 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2596 is to be kept in a modified containment chamber at Reliquary Site-25, equipped with water drain flooring and transparent plexiglass ceiling. The water drain is to be connected to a storage chamber underneath the containment chamber. The storage chamber is to be emptied once per week. 

Subjects placed on SCP-2596 for at least one minute continuously are to be treated for wounds upon their exit from SCP-2596. Under normal circumstances, subjects placed on SCP-2596 are required to exit SCP-2596 when they are placed there for 2.5 minutes continuously. Approval from Project Head/2596 is required for experiments involving a subject placed on SCP-2596 for at least three minutes continuously. 

**Description:** SCP-2596 is a wooden raft with a surface area of 2.4 m^^2^^. It is constructed entirely from wooden shards affixed together via an adhesive agent. Due to its makeshift appearance, irregularly-shaped openings are found throughout SCP-2596. Following the events of **Experiment 2596/04**, the openings secrete non-anomalous fresh water at a constant rate of 100 mL/s. Therefore, SCP-2596 has sustained significant water damage. 

Humans placed on SCP-2596 (hereon referred to as &#39;subjects&#39;) will immediately experience visual and auditory hallucinations. They will consistently perceive their environment to be an overcast area of high brightness levels. Auditory hallucinations primarily involve words spoken in the subjects&#39; arterial language, urging them to forget or turn back. Despite apparent similarities with [[[[dr-clef-s-proposal|DATA EXPUNGED]]]], subjects retain sufficient agency to choose not to comply with the auditory hallucinations and any ties to [[[[dr-clef-s-proposal|DATA EXPUNGED]]]] is deemed to be either superficial or coincidental. 

As subjects remain on SCP-2596 for a continuous duration, puncture wounds will manifest on their palms and feet. If subjects leave SCP-2596 while the wounds are manifesting, further manifestation will cease upon exit. 

If subjects remain on SCP-2596 for more than three minutes continuously, they will vanish instantaneously. Their clothes and accessories (e.g. jewelry, implants, piercings) will remain on the SCP-2596. In addition, the subjects&#39; blood will secrete from the openings on SCP-2596, with the only known exception being the events of **Experiment 2596/03**. Prior to vanishment, subjects are capable of exiting SCP-2596 if they desire so. 

SCP-2596 was discovered in the basement of a private property near Lake Geneva on ██/██/2005. The property served as a safe house for the Vera Crux Heresy. [[footnote]] A now-defunct minor heretical sect consisting of Calvinist defectors from the Horizon Initiative. Its core tenet is the application of anomalous objects with the intent of entering Heaven alive. [[/footnote]] Below is an excerpt of a pamphlet circulated among sect members, urging them to attend a gathering on ██/██/2005.

&gt; The True Cross is united. The fragments no longer lie in mindless idolatry. Come to Lake Geneva. We will embark on the vessel to Heaven and be in communion with the Lord. 

As such, a raid on said property was conducted by Mobile Task Force Alpha-26 (&#34;Devour Dawn&#34;). During the raid, one Vera Cruz Heresy member offered heavy resistance and attempted to deny access to the safe house&#39;s basement. Eventually, he was terminated by Foundation personnel. 

No other members of the Vera Crux Heresy were found, although their clothes and personal effects were found in the basement and they were confirmed to have entered it. Blood samples collected from SCP-2596&#39;s vicinity are believed to have originated from them, thus it is assumed that the other members have utilised SCP-2596.  

Intelligence gathered from the Horizon Initiative suggests that the Vera Crux Heresy was neutralised by Project Malleus [[footnote]] The paramilitary wing of the Horizon Initiative, infamous for their zeal and aggression in line of duty. [[/footnote]] following the raid on the safe house near Lake Geneva. However, no member of Project Malleus was present during said raid.

**Addendum 2596-2:** On ██/██/2006, MTF A-26 conducted a raid on a Project Malleus stronghold at Astrakhan, Russia. A person resembling D-8375 was among the persons apprehended from the stronghold. His identity was later verified via valid identification tattoos, and he was subsequently interrogated. 

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ View Interview Log 2596/D-8375-1&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide Log&#34;]]

&gt; **Interviewee:** D-8375
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Agent Ahmad bin Ibrahim 
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** The following interview aims to gain insight regarding the interviewee&#39;s whereabouts following the events of **Experiment 2596/03**, and is conducted in Arabic. 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;** 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ahmad:** D-8375, peace be upon you. It has been a while since your disappearance, yes? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-8375:** I didn&#39;t disappear. You people put me on that piece of wood and sent me away. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ahmad:** I suppose you recall your last test with my colleagues? 
&gt; 
&gt; [D-8375 raises his palms, both of which were bandaged.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ahmad:** I see that you were treated for those injuries. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-8375:** No thanks to you people. [sighs] 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ahmad:** I can assure you that it was not intentional. We did not understand the phenomenon well enough then. It&#39;s still the case now, so we need information. So help us out. It is by God&#39;s will that you return to us today. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-8375:** [sighs] God willing. [pauses] Okay, what do you want to know? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ahmad:** Let&#39;s start from where you went to after vanishing from the raft. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-8375:** I didn&#39;t know where it was exactly, but I was there before I knew it. And the first thing I saw were half a dozen Christians and Muslims armed with AK-47s. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ahmad:** And how did you deduce that? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-8375:** Most of them were obviously Christians, with this strange cross with a diagonal line across the vertical one. The others were definitely Muslim. I think I can recognise my people, so to speak.    
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ahmad:** Okay. How did they respond to your presence? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-8375:** I begged for their mercy. If you were in my situation, you would too! I mean, I was naked and in no position to do anything else! But fortunately, they realised I mean them no harm and gave me something to cover myself. I was lucky too. When I appeared, they looked ready to gun me down. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ahmad:** Do you know why they spared you?  
&gt; 
&gt; **D-8375:** Maybe a moment of mercy? Anyway, they then interrogated me. Asked me if I know anything about entering Heaven alive, where I was from and-
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ahmad:** Did you tell them about us? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-8375:** I was in no position to lie. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ahmad:** What about the place you appeared in? Any distinct features? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-8375:** I was standing on wood. But I disposed of it at their orders.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ahmad:** Their? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-8375:** The men who &#39;greeted&#39; me when I arrived. They made me help out at their base since then, mostly menial labour. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ahmad:** Can you elaborate on the menial labour? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-8375:** Err, physical stuff. They would ask me to clean up the stronghold sometimes. My first task was to help them dispose of severals bags of ashes in the Volga.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ahmad:** Do you know any details about those ashes? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-8375:** I was told that they belonged to fools who thought they would enter Heaven but instead walk towards their deaths, so I should not pray for their souls at all. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ahmad:** I see. So you have been working with those people since then. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-8375:** I have no other options. Look at me, I&#39;m an Arab stranded in a foreign land. Besides, they told me that they were doing God&#39;s work and how I can do God&#39;s work indirectly by helping them. After what I went through in my life, I needed that. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ahmad:** So did those people tell you why they were disposing the wood? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-8375:** Told me that it was no longer needed. You know, after I sawed off the wood, it was suddenly splattered with blood. And there were slices of flesh lying on the floor. At least the tattoo was still visible. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ahmad:** What kind of tattoo was it? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-8375:** The same kind of tattoo you people gave me. [gestures to his chest and wrist, where identification tattoos are present] The number is the one after mine, although I did not know the person. Anyway, they then instructed me to burn everything.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ahmad:** Does that include the wood? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-8375:** Yes, and I dumped the ashes into the Volga. They should still be there, I think. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ahmad:** I see. Do you have anything else to say? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-8375:** Yeah. Keep me away from those people. I think they blame me for your people&#39;s attack on them. Their mercy runs thin.   
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ahmad:** I can appeal for you, but no promises.  
&gt; 
&gt; **D-8375:** Bless you.  
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Close Log&gt;**  
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Agent Ahmad has submitted an E-class application for D-8375 under the reasoning that he has been affected by SCP-2596 previously and due to potential knowledge regarding Project Malleus. Pending approval. 

[[/collapsible]] 

**Addendum 2596-3:** Since ██/██/2006, water secreted from SCP-2596 is identified to be a mixture of fresh water and human saliva (in significantly high proportions). Subsequent meta-analysis indicates a DNA match with precipitation samples obtained via secondary instances of [[[SCP-2198]]]. In response, Senior Researcher Hamlin has hypothesised a spatial anomaly between SCP-2596 and an area affected by a secondary instance of SCP-2198. 

Using [[[[SCP-2897|DATA EXPUNGED]]]], meteorological data has been cross-referenced and about 100 locations in central Russia have been shortlisted as potential exit points from SCP-2596. 

Usage of SCP-2596 is hypothesised to allow Foundation personnel to pinpoint the exact coordinates of the aforementioned exit points. However, implementation is currently put on hiatus due to low priority and ethical concerns.
