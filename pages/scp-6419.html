**Item #:** SCP-6419

**Object Class:** Euclid --Safe--

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6419 is to remain in a plexiglass case inside of Site-78&#39;s room 43. SCP-6419 is not to be handled or opened by any living being. If it is to be moved for any reason then the usage of robotics or drones shall be required. If opened, no personnel are to look at its pages. --In case of testing, one Pig specimen is to be exposed to the book via drone. MTF Sigma-26 (Shinigami&#39;s Eyes) are to monitor the subject, intervene to save the life of the subject if requested by the supervising researcher, and mitigate containment breaches caused by SCP-6419.--

No further testing with SCP-6419 is allowed in accordance with the Ethics Committee. Any sentient being who survives for longer than 24 hours after contact with SCP-6419 is to be terminated. (See &#34;A note regarding Researcher Jackson&#39;s research into SCP-6419&#34; for more information.)

**Description:** SCP-6419 is a leather-bound hardcover book with a blank front and back cover. On the spine of SCP-6419 is an engraving that reads &#34;II of IX&#34;. Its covers and pages appear to be immune to tearing and liquids spilled on its pages will dry up. The book&#39;s primary effect is a touch/sight based cognitohazard activated when a sentient being touches the book with their hands or views its contents directly. This effect will extend to the last person to view or touch SCP-6419 once the current &#34;target&#34; expires.

While a subject makes contact or views SCP-6419, a new story will be written in its pages at a rate of 40 WPM through unknown, anomalous means. SCP-6419 currently contains 250 stories. Once a sentence is completed in SCP-6419 it will take effect in the real world in 60 seconds. The story written on the pages will inevitably lead to the affected person&#39;s death. SCP-6419 is capable of influencing reality in order to achieve its goal of subject termination, often by manipulating persons, weather patterns, anomalies, among other variables. The range of this effect is currently unknown, although SCP-6419 has controlled phenomena in a radius of at least five miles. Subjects targeted by the book&#39;s effect may be saved from what is written among the pages, but the book will employ increasingly extreme methods to kill the subject. It will eventually reach a point that even those who attempt to save the subject of the anomaly&#39;s focus will also be put at risk. While others may be harmed or killed in the process, no new “targets” can be created by providing assistance to the main target of SCP-6419.

Victims of SCP-6419 display heightened usage of writing and storytelling based euphemisms and metaphors as well as a strong desire to finish personal projects and get their affairs in order. These victims display anxiety and nervousness when they are impeded from these goals.

During the initial 60 second window of the anomaly’s “writing”, should two individuals look at the book one after the other and the second observer terminates the first observer within those first 60 seconds, the second observer will be “spared” by SCP-6419 with no actions taken by the object. These people are referred to in SCP-6419 as &#34;Contractees&#34; but the specifics of this title are currently unknown. 

The book is believed to have a low level of sentience, as its methods appear to become more focused over time in an intelligent manner. Each additional story seemingly enhances the effectiveness, speed, and lethality of the next story. SCP-6419&#39;s intelligence leads it to making slightly illogical writing choices. Occasionally it won&#39;t direct people who could prevent the deaths of its target, or it will choose more complex deaths over simple ones. There is no known reason for this, but researchers currently theorize that SCP-6419 is attempting to write more “narratively dramatic” deaths for its victims.

**Discovery:** On 12-6-2022 MTF Sigma-26 raided a warehouse belonging to a cell of the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/chaos-insurgency-hub/ Chaos Insurgency] located in [DATA EXPUNGED], North America. The mission was completed without any casualties and resulted in the deaths of 28 hostiles. The items recovered from the raid were SCP-6419 which was kept within a plexiglass container with the instructions for the object along with it.

The object was classified as SCP-6419 and initially marked as Safe. Until  shortly after the mission, S-26-8 committed suicide by placing the tip of his M4A1 rifle to his chin and pulling the trigger. S-26-8 had handled the book before handing it over to the Foundation for containment. The object was then reclassified as Euclid and testing began under the supervision of Researcher Todd Jackson.

**Addendum 6419.01:** The following tests are from the first round of testing of SCP-6419. No interventions were allowed.  Unremarkable tests have been omitted.

&gt; **Summary of Tests 0001-0008**: Early tests on SCP-6419 with pig specimens showed that the anomaly would take the easiest route to kill the animal with what was closest. Put a pig alone in a room and it dies of a heart attack. Place the pig in a room with a D-Class armed with a weapon and the D-Class will kill the pig. It wasn&#39;t until I set up a test with a D-Class and over 40 potential methods of termination did SCP-6419 choose a method that was more complex and grander, a true story of death. I wanted to continue with these human trials to see how it affected the mind of a sentient being but Director Richter mandated that no more D-Class be exposed to the book as it was a &#34;waste of life&#34;. So back to the pigs it is then... - Researcher Jackson

After the Pig is exposed to the anomaly, D-1958 terminates the subject, verbally and visually expressing remorse at having to do it. She picks up the book and reads from it, despite being splattered with blood; D-1958 does not appear to have trouble reading. She says verbatim, **&#39;Jona - Oh! He&#39;s dead...sad. Samantha, D-1958, has done the intended deed and in doing so has eluded her grim fate.&#39;** After several minutes nothing anomalous or of note happened to D-1958. She was returned to her holding cell following a twenty minute observation period.

 Interesting, we found a loophole and I didn&#39;t even need to waste a D-Class; perhaps the rest of these tests can be run with animals. I&#39;m beginning to wonder about the implications this book may have on Foundation activities. Stunningly, the book showed surprise at the actions taken by D-1958. This opens a whole new avenue for testing and observation into its behavior and knowledge of the world. - Researcher Jackson.

Hello Researcher Jackson, 
My name is Greg Chudley, and I was assigned to your team to provide materials and other equipment for testing. I must implore you to cease testing on SCP-6419. We&#39;ve already had one D-Class lose their life fruitlessly not to mention how many pigs. It&#39;s immoral and you get the same result every time. 

I know you have a history of intensive testing but this anomaly is only getting stronger with each and every story in its pages. I think we’re playing with fire here and we don&#39;t realize it yet. What if it figures out how to direct itself into getting touched again? If the book decided that it would be amusing if one of us tried to kill ourselves by walking straight into the O5 council and offing one of them, what would we do about it? What if it leaked sensitive information?  It seems to know the names of everyone it writes about. 

Please think about what I&#39;ve said and respond as quickly as possible.

Listen to me, Chudley.

I have been working at the foundation since you were in diapers. I know what I&#39;m doing. We are at the cusp of a breakthrough here. Do you not realize that we could use this to take out enemies of the foundation? It doesn&#39;t matter how many tests we have to do. Forty, sixty, even a hundred. We must crack the secrets of this book and see if we can save one of those it marked for death. The nature of science is to get to the bottom of every mystery and I won&#39;t be stopped by some weak-willed animal activist that cares too much about pigs.

Let the adults handle things, Chudley. And get Dr. Bright on the line, I have an idea.

**Addendum 6419.02:** The following tests are from the second series of SCP-6419 testing. This battery of tests was conducted to see how interventions change SCP-6419&#39;s effects. Unremarkable tests have been omitted.

Dr. Bright was told to read SCP-6419, saying the following: **&#39;Oh, the one whose story will never end. [sighs] Dr. Bright slits his throat with the knife and D-4343 puts on the necklace.&#39;** 

 Dr. Bright then cursed out the book for its apparent disinterest and then proceeded to slit his throat after sixty seconds had elapsed. D-4343 then placed SCP-963 on its neck and walked out as Dr. Bright.

I wanted to see what would happen if the book came across someone who couldn&#39;t be killed. As it turns out the book is merely annoyed by the fact that it is powerless to do anything. Bright seemed a bit dismayed that he wasn&#39;t neutralized but it was worth a shot. - Researcher Jackson

The subject was administered Nitroglycerin for a heart attack. A minute later, the doctor who administered it attempted to kill the pig with a scalpel he had on his person. S-26-2 enters the room and incapacitates the doctor. A minute passed and Researcher Marvin Fields came into the room, holding a primed grenade. S-26-2 tried to talk Fields down but he threw the explosive and it subsequently detonated. Fields and S-26-2 suffered grievous but survivable injuries. The animal test subject expired from the injuries.

Well we know now that SCP-6419 does not care about collateral damage if the person around them had intervened previously. It&#39;s a shame about what happened to Fields and the MTF, but this story has yielded invaluable information - the grimoire can control and influence others without even being in the vicinity. The tests shall continue. -Researcher Jackson

(First four interventions removed for brevity).The fifth and last attempt came when law enforcement was called to the scene on grounds that a dangerous animal had been spotted by a civilian. Due to the remote location, Researcher Jackson ordered the MTF to engage with law enforcement but despite these efforts, a sniper was able to terminate the subject. Surviving law enforcement was amnescitized.

This nearly got out of hand. I thought placing the damn pig in a place with hardly any danger might stump the book but it got the better of me. This escalation of threat cannot go on forever. It must have a limit and I will find it. - Researcher Jackson

(Initial eight interventions removed for brevity.) The subject was chased into the Site Cafeteria. It nearly consumed a nearby bottle of cleaning fluid but was stopped by S-26-1. A minute later, Researcher Michael Jones entered the cafeteria with [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3108 SCP-3108] and fired repeatedly on the subject, devolving them into a pile of [DATA EXPUNGED]. The incident caused the deaths of two MTF, three researchers, and four D-Class.

This is a breakthrough, SCP-6419 is aware of the nature of the anomalous. It can control them in some shape or fashion. It must consider it to be the ultimate escalation. Yes! This is what I was waiting for. I will break you, SCP-6419 - Researcher Jackson.

&gt; -----
&gt; [Begin Recording]
&gt;  
&gt; [The Camera turns on showing Researcher Jackson in a leather office chair, he is currently fidgeting his fingers, looking impatient.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Richter:** Stating my name and title for the record, Site-78 Director Leah Richter. Interviewing Todd Jackson on recent testing on SCP-6419. Specifically test numbers 0012 and 0036.
&gt; 
&gt; **Todd:** This is a waste of time, I need to get back to my research.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richter:** Todd you&#39;re deflecting. You know this is protocol. There are people above me who are concerned with what has been happening here at our site. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Todd:** There is nothing to be concerned about. My research is continuing as planned.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richter:** Nothing to be concerned about? How about nearly killing Dr. Bright? You want to explain that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Todd:** I knew it wouldn&#39;t kill him. You know how SCP-963 works, Bright is functionally immortal and he consented.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richter:** You knew the result regardless and you didn&#39;t get permission to cross test. And there will be no cross testing with this SCP.
&gt; 
&gt; **Todd:** Richter, you&#39;ve got to be kidding me. Think of the opportunities that were missing out on! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Richter:**  The last thing we need is that book in the hands of an anomaly. We don&#39;t know how it would act or if any of them could control its effect. Speaking of your recklessness, let&#39;s talk about 0036.
&gt; 
&gt; **Todd:** What about it? It was quite the tale.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richter**: That is not how I would describe it. Five personnel and four more D-Class over a pig! Not to mention, Researcher Jones brought SCP-3108 out of containment after we recently retrieved it. That anomaly is at risk of causing more containment breaches. You are lucky that you have tenure at this Foundation that the higher ups don&#39;t want me to expel you outright. I better hear a good explanation to why I should let you continue testing or your being reassigned. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Todd:** Because I am at the apex of my research. We finally confirmed it can control  anomalies. If you just let me continue my tests, we can develop a method using the Pigs as subjects to use  the book to lure out anomalies in the field and contain them. We just keep the Pig alive long enough in an area that we expect an anomaly to be and it should not only lure it out but tell us information about it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richter:** Hmmm. Intriguing. You do have a point, Todd. Such an anomaly might just be what we are looking for. Are you 100% sure that it would work? We&#39;ve worked together for some time Todd and I want to trust what you&#39;re saying.
&gt; 
&gt; **Todd:** I am 100% confident in the writing on the wall with SCP-6419. Please, let me finish my research.
&gt; 
&gt; **Richter:** (sighs) Fine but no more Foundation Casualties. You are to conduct your research using proper safety protocols. I&#39;m also capping you at sixty five tests. If I don&#39;t see a method on how to properly lure anomalies out by then or ANY Foundation Personnel or D-Class perish during your efforts, we&#39;re locking SCP-6419 back in its container and that&#39;s the end of it. End of Inquiry.

I cannot believe Site Director Richter is still letting you do this after the stunt you pulled. You killed innocent police officers, researchers, MTF and…God, the Pigs! I can&#39;t let this continue. I&#39;m submitting a report to the Ethics Committee to have your research shut down. Please, I&#39;m begging you to stop the tests now before anything else happens.

You are acting out of line Chudley. We are THIS close to cracking the secret of the book. We can&#39;t stop now because of a few accidents. You will see in the end that this research is for the betterment of the Foundation and the world at large. You can go ahead and send that report if you want but in the bureaucratic nightmare that is Ethics handling paperwork they won&#39;t get it to it for a month and in that time, I will have ended this book&#39;s story.

**Addendum 6419.03:**

The following tests are from the third testing sequence of SCP-6419. The goal of these tests was to entice SCP-6419 to invoke anomalies during its stories through consistent intervention. Tests where anomalies did not appear were removed.

After nearly 60 attempts on its life, D-7341 and the subject attempted to flee from an angry mob trying to execute the Pig for perceived crimes. It was then that [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1233 SCP-1233] landed on top of the subject terminating him instantly. SCP-1233 then proceeded to ask the mob if they would assist him in defeating the Moon Monsters. The town was subsequently amnesticized and efforts to contain SCP-1233 were unsuccessful.

&gt; **Timeline of SCP-6419.065**
&gt; 
&gt; **08:00:00:** Test 6419.065 begins
&gt; 
&gt; **12:00:00:**  The 100th intervention is reached, several Keter class anomalies break containment causing numerous casualties.
&gt; 
&gt; **12:10:00:** Several MTF units including Sigma-26 are deployed on scene to recapture the anomalies.
&gt; 
&gt; **12:15:00:** Researcher Chudley along with Sigma-26-9 are seen evacuating researchers from their workstations.
&gt; 
&gt; **12:20:00:** Researcher Jackson is seen taking SCP-6419 from its current location and finding a place to hide with it. He appears to be reading through its pages and mumbling something.
&gt; 
&gt; **12:30:00:** Explosions rock the walls of Site-78 as Chaos Insurgency agents arrived. Though the specific cell hasn&#39;t been identified, they are believed to have been under the command of the POI known as &#34;The Red Scar&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; **12:35:00:** Chaos Insurgency agents engage with Foundation MTF forces, The Red Scar appears to order her men to capture the anomalies and wipe out all opposition.
&gt; 
&gt; **12:40:00:** While combat is going on in almost all areas of the Site, D-1958 picks up a rifle from a deceased MTF and starts heading towards Researcher Jackson&#39;s current location.
&gt; 
&gt; **1:00:00:** Foundation combat personnel have lost 25% of their forces. All anomalies have been moved to emergency holding cells but the Red Scar and a few of her special forces remain on site.
&gt; -------------------------------------
&gt; [Video Recording found, begin playback]
&gt; 
&gt; [Researcher Jackson is in his office reading SCP-6419&#39;s pages.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** **&#39;Researcher Jackson is safe from the chaos around him. He only needs to wait until the MTF forces have cleared out the Chaos Insurgency.&#39;** Good. That&#39;s good. What happens next? **&#39;Researcher Jackson is nearing the final act of his story, a figure opens the door.&#39;**
&gt; 
&gt; [A minute after, D-1958 opens the door and enters the study. D-1958 holds their Rifle in one hand as they gesture with surprise.]
&gt; 
&gt; **D-1958:** And it is D-1958! The one that was spared. Please stop reading from my pages Jackson. I don&#39;t want you seeing any spoilers.
&gt; 
&gt; [Jackson closes the pages.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** D-1958? Wait, no. The way you&#39;re speaking.... you&#39;re the anomaly.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-1958:** Speaking through this common criminal, yes. We&#39;ve had a lot of fun together Jackson although I was reeeeally stretching it with your plot armor. Allowing you to continue testing after you got all those people killed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** W-wait... Director Richter wasn&#39;t being lenient? That was you?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-1958:** Yes! Every moment up to this point has all been orchestrated by Izanami&#39;s Grimoire! The vile plot by the Chaos Insurgency to trick the Foundation into picking up the book and falling into the hands of one Researcher Jackson. Jackson would feed me as many stories as possible, trying his best to save my victims. But at the end when our battle reached a fever pitch by unleashing all those Keters, the Chaos Insurgency would be waiting!
&gt; 
&gt; [Jackson appears distraught at D-1958&#39;s words.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Jackson:** No. That’s not possible, when would you have had the opportunity to start doing this? Was it when the Chaos Insurgency got you from who knows where? When the MTF handed me the-, oh god. He handed me the book!
&gt; 
&gt; **D-1958:** Whoa, Whoa. I can&#39;t answer that. That takes away all the intrigue. It doesn&#39;t matter who made me. What matters now, is that your story has to end. Goodbye Researcher Jackson, you were truly my greatest work.
&gt; 
&gt; [D-1958 terminates Researcher Jackson and heads back to their cell. D-1958 was later terminated in accordance with revised containment procedures.]
&gt; --------------
&gt; 
&gt; **1:30:00:** The Red Scar manages to escape from Site-78, leaving four mangled MTF in her wake. The remaining commandos are captured. Site Director Richter issues an emergency order to Researcher Chudley to take over Jackson&#39;s team and begin interviewing the commandos as soon as they are processed.
&gt; 
&gt; **1:45:00:** A drone moves in and re-secures SCP-6419, placing it back into its protective case and moving it to its secure containment cell.
