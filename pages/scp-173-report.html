++++ Addendum 173-U
During a site-wide incursion on May 16th,████, SCP 173 breached containment. A pair of class-D personnel were able to lure the object into SCP 914&#39;s containment chamber. It is believed that the class-d were trying to destroy SCP 173 by utilizing SCP 914&#39;s &#34;rough&#34; setting. During this attempt, one of the individuals became trapped within SCP 914&#39;s &#34;input&#34; chamber along with SCP 173. The other class-D changed the clockworks&#39; setting to 1:1 and activated the machine before escaping. SCP 173 survived the process and was apparently unharmed, however, its physical appearance is now altered. The trapped class-D was not recovered.

+++++ Log 173-U-1: Dr. ██████
//During the breach, it appears that a pair of class-C lured 173 into 914&#39;s containment cell. I&#39;ve looked over the surveillance logs and it appears the plan was to simply enclose it in the chamber and lock the door. There was a complication when the younger of the two became trapped in the input booth alongside 173. Seemingly in a panic, the older class-D attempted to try to free the younger class-D… But being inexperienced in operating 914 he started pressing or twisting any button or dial he could. The older class-D accidentally activated 914 on the &#39;1:1&#39; setting- judging by the security footage, this wasn&#39;t his intention as the older class-D was observed to be extremely distressed and immediately fled the containment chamber.//

//The problem is that there is a lot about this version of SCP-173 we don&#39;t understand. It appears to behave in a similar manner as before, which the other class-D learned the hard way. But the full extent of the physical changes are still under review. Testing indicates it doesn&#39;t have any new abilities beyond the facial patterns altering over time, which seems to be purely cosmetic and as far as we&#39;ve observed - they don&#39;t seem to reflect SCP-173&#39;s mood or intent. The physical appearance has been drastically changed as well. We&#39;ll keep testing until we&#39;re sure that these cosmetic changes aren&#39;t indicative of anything else. From now on, we will now refer to the sculpture as SCP-173-U.//

++++ Addendum 173-E
March 24th, ████; Site ██: It had been a week and the annual cleaning of SCP 173&#39;s cell was about to take place. All seemed normal until the cell doors were opened, foundation members were surprised to see that SCP 173 had once again changed, its physical form was different and
it had seemingly grown several feet. The cleaning was canceled and SCP 173 was moved to Site ██ for testing. Testing showed that SCP 173&#39;s physical form was the only thing that had changed about the anomaly.

------

++++ Addendum 173-H
August 2nd, ████; Site ██: In the middle of testing, SCP 173 began to change its structure before researchers&#39; very eyes. Its body was reported to crumble and crack, before seemingly melting and molding itself into a new humanoid form. SCP 173 went on to cause a containment breach afterward when the door controls for its cell began to malfunction for unknown reasons. SCP 173 was contained and put back into its cell. After the incident, it discussed whether to report the incident to the O5 council, though the idea was dismissed by the Site Supervisor as he believed it wasn&#39;t necessary.

------

++++ Addendum 173-R
December 29th, ████; Site ██: SCP 173 once again was caught changing its form on camera. This time into an even more humanoid version of itself, with hands and long arms. This version of SCP 173 was proven to act slightly different to the original, as it would sometimes move while in foundation members&#39; peripheral which is not usual for SCP 173. The anomalous behavior of SCP 173 was finally reported to the O5 council.

{{SCP 173 has continued to change its physical form every couple months since ████. Every time SCP 173 changes form a new photo is to be taken of the anomaly and put into the archives. New forms of SCP 173 are to be given titles using abbreviations after the SCP&#39;s number. The anomalous behavior or SCP 173 is theorized to be caused by the incident with SCP 914.}}

------

**The following is a list of notable forms SCP 173 has taken in the past two years:**

&gt; **SCP 173-E:** SCP 173-E, like SCP 173-U, has arms made from rebar. Its legs also appear to be made from rebar and, its body is much larger and wider. Its head appears to have reverted back to its original form. Testing showed that this form acts exactly the same as the previous two incarnations.
&gt; **SCP 173-H:** SCP 173-H is the first truly humanoid form SCP 173 has taken. It resembles a humanoid figure made of stone. Its head looks like a skull, however its body looks much more human. SCP 173-H has strange tubes all over its body. SCP 173-H acts exactly the same as the original SCP 173-O. Other than its appearance, it is exactly the same as the original.
&gt; **SCP 173-R:** SCP 173-R is the most humanoid form SCP 173 has taken in the past two years. It is also the tallest incarnation of the anomaly to date. SCP 173-R has long arms and legs with a head in the shape of a bag. The spray painted face is replaced with two empty eye sockets. Under the empty eyes there are seemingly spray painted tear tracks. SCP 173-R is the slowest version of SCP 173 to date, sometimes not even being able to move ten inches in the blink of an eye. Which makes him the least dangerous version yet, while also being the most unpredictable as he can move while in a human&#39;s peripheral.
&gt; **SCP 173-I:** Very similar to SCP 173-R in body shape. Unlike SCP 173-R, SCP 173-I is very fast and can also move its body in ways that no other form of SCP 173 has been able to do in the past. Such as using its hands to open doors, and stooping to duck underneath smaller areas.

Many more forms have been taken by SCP 173 in recent years and have been put into the foundation&#39;s archives. The following is Dr. ██████&#39;s opinion on the matter:

//The changes in SCp-173&#39;s form so far have mainly been cosmetic. However, there have been some versions that have behaved ever so slightly different than the original.
Take SCP-173-R for instance. SCP-173-R is much slower than the original. However it makes up for this with the ability to move while in your peripheral. Or SCP-173-K which can use its hands to break down doors. It is my firm belief that if we let this continue, we will run the risk of 173 becoming something truly monstrous. So, I suggest that we put SCP-173 back into the clockworks and attempt to revert him back to his original form. It will be dangerous of course, but it will decrease the chances of SCP-173 becoming unstoppable.//

Dr. ██████&#39;s idea has yet to be approved by the O5 council.

------

__Any changes in SCP 173&#39;s form or behavior is to be immediately reported to the O5 council__
