**Item #:** SCP-2567

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2567 is to remain within the confines of its graveyard territory. The outskirts of SCP-2567&#39;s territory must be guarded by no fewer than four security personnel. In the event that SCP-2567 exits its territory, personnel are required to fire upon SCP-2567 to severely damage it and draw it back to its graveyard.

SCP-2567 is to be herded away from visiting civilians by assigned field agents[[footnote]] Field agents assigned to SCP-2567 are to be supplied with false ID&#39;s and deployed under cover as cemetery tenders.[[/footnote]]. In the event that any civilian observes SCP-2567, they are to be administered class-A amnestics and removed from the cemetery perimeter.

**Description:** SCP-2567 is a humanoid figure standing 2.57 meters in height, and weighing 85 kilograms. Its body is comprised of finely-knitted pale and dark grey straw. SCP-2567 wears a black tuxedo and petty coat and a wide-brimmed bowler&#39;s hat comprised of the same material. SCP-2567&#39;s face has several large bulbous eyes on its head. These eyes are not fixed in place, and SCP-2567 is able to shift them across its surface to point in a desired direction. SCP-2567&#39;s eyes emit a lavender-scented liquid that drastically accelerates floral growth when spread over a burial site.

SCP-2567 resides within a cemetery 1.3 kilometers from the Site-12 Mt. Sugarloaf facility in Sunderland, Massachusetts, measuring 120 meters by 200 meters. It displays no unprompted aggression to living organisms and will display passive behavior unless its territory[[footnote]] As defined by the cemetery borders. [[/footnote]] is vandalized or violated in any way. This includes committing acts of grave robbery, littering, damaging headstones, and graffiti.

When SCP-2567&#39;s territory is damaged or vandalized, it will attempt to repair any damaged components of the cemetery using the grey liquid it produces as an adhesive to reconstruct damaged headstones.

All attempts to relocate SCP-2567 to a controlled facility have failed. When removed from its territory SCP-2567 will fall apart and dissolve, and a new instance of SCP-2567 will appear at its graveyard.

SCP-2567 displays extreme resilience to damage and will not attack living individuals that attempt to damage it. If SCP-2567 sustains significant damage it will return to its graveyard and enter the central mausoleum where it will encase itself in a stone coffin. After 24 hours, SCP-2567 will exit its coffin in a state of full repair. SCP-2567&#39;s mausoleum displays no anomalous properties on its own. The entrance has a plaque which reads:

&gt; Jackson M. Maywall
&gt; October 19th, 1936 - [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
&gt; A kind-hearted public servant and friend to all who knew him. May his soul find eternal peace in the land of his love.

Under the approval of level-2 administrative personnel an investigation into the whereabouts of the corpse of Maywall has been put underway. The agent assigned to investigating the possible link to SCP-2567 recorded the following conversation with a local grave keeper.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Transcript From Agent E. Ville&#34; hide=&#34;- Close This Transcript&#34;]]
&gt; **Interviewed:** Harold F. Tanner, grave keeper
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Agent Franklin E. Ville
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Agent Ville questioned several inhabitants around the town of Sunderland, Massachusetts, before concluding his investigation with an interview with one of the night-shift grave keepers of the town.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ville:** So, I&#39;ve asked around, and you seem to have been the closest person to the late Mr. Maywall. Is that true?
&gt; 
&gt; **Harold Tanner:** Aye, yeah. You could say closest, but to be fair he was everyone&#39;s friend. Real kind man, he was.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ville:** Right. So I&#39;ve come to gather that he was an admired figure in the community, yeah?
&gt; 
&gt; **Harold Tanner:** Absolutely! He and his wife worked in the library, down by the corner store. They kept the place colorful. The kids loved &#39;em.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ville:** Can you tell me about them? Jackson and his wife, I mean. I haven&#39;t heard much about the wife from anyone.
&gt; 
&gt; **Harold Tanner:** Mmhm. Yeah... Sure, I can tell you whatever you need. Care if I ask a question of my own?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ville:** Not at all. Ask away.
&gt; 
&gt; **Harold Tanner:** Why&#39;re you asking around about the Maywalls? Extended family get into some trouble?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ville:** Not at all. Jackson knew my mom when she was a little girl, she told me a lot of stories, just thought I&#39;d come ask about, then pay my respects.
&gt; 
&gt; **Harold Tanner:** Mm... Good a reason as ever. Anyways... Georgia Maywall was a nice enough woman. Real religious, but Jackson never was. They had a lot of differences, but you couldn&#39;t ask for a closer couple.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ville:** That sounds nice. Not many people get that any more.
&gt; 
&gt; **Harold Tanner:** Mmhm. It was real nice, up until a few years back. She&#39;d gotten liver cancer, but Jackson stayed with her all the way through. Wouldn&#39;t leave her side for more than a few hours, right up &#39;til the end.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ville:** And after she&#39;d passed away?
&gt; 
&gt; **Harold Tanner:** Well, he didn&#39;t last much longer after she passed, maybe three years? He died in bed, though. Died happy, with some of his oldest friends by his side.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ville:** What about before he died? What was he doing then?
&gt; 
&gt; **Harold Tanner:** Well, afterwards... He dropped his job at the library, and took one up where Georgia was buried, as the day time tender. Kept things tidy in the cemetery. It&#39;s a bit of a grim job, but he always smiled. I guess, in a way, he really was with her until the very end.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ville:** I guess we should all hope to be that lucky. My grandfather died overseas a long time back. So, did anyone see Maywall much during his time in the cemetery?
&gt; 
&gt; **Harold Tanner:** Oh boy, yeah, plenty! We all visited him, couple of times a week at least but he spent every day in the cemetery. Every Thursday, he&#39;d bring a bouquet of lavenders to her headstone, and spend the evening reading to her. I&#39;m sure he&#39;d have given anything to pass on, right there next to her. I can&#39;t imagine how it must&#39;ve been for him, losin&#39; the closest person he&#39;s ever had.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Ville:** I certainly couldn&#39;t imagine it. I should probably be hitting the road soon, but I want to thank you for taking the time to talk with me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Harold Tanner:** Ain&#39;t a problem... Any friend of the Maywalls is welcome to take my time as they please.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** As per investigations regarding the Maywall family, SCP-2567 displays thematic similarities to Jackson Maywall before his passing such as the lavenders Jackson would leave at Georgia&#39;s grave, and the lavender-colored fluid that leaks from SCP-2567&#39;s eyes, as well as its constant presence in the area surrounding both Jackson and Georgia&#39;s grave and mausoleum.
