This is dumb. I&#39;ve been sitting here for at least 30 minutes. Surely one bagel won&#39;t be noticed by anyone, right?

There&#39;s a certain charm to an empty conference room. Sort of like a liminal space, which I&#39;d enjoy a lot more if not for the fact that it&#39;s worryingly late for the room to be empty. No department head to greet people at the entrance, no pleasantries to be exchanged with another soul. There&#39;s just me and a refreshments table that I can&#39;t touch in fear of being the first asshole to grab a bagel.

I check my watch. //10:50.// That&#39;s 20 minutes. //I fucked up the room number.// As I stand up to leave, I dread the inevitable glares from the entire room when I arrive 20 minutes late to whatever the orientation even is. Not that it even matters, because being real, by the time you get called to an orientation you&#39;re already in way too deep to get out. Orientations are just the gruel the Foundation needs to feed you before you actually get to do anything. Just like a real workplace!

As I leave, I pass the refreshments table. //There are studies about this. Five-year-olds have been able to pass them. They&#39;re not even for you, they&#39;re for whichever department actually booked this room.// That&#39;s a solid argument. I&#39;m pretty proud of it. 

I grab a bagel and head out into Site-19.

//No, that&#39;s the right room.//

The conference hall&#39;s help desk is chock-full of people scrambling to find the right room. Having the bulk of the Foundation&#39;s departments do their orientation shtick at the same time, at the same place, every year never seems to make it easier for nineteen&#39;s staff not to drop the ball logistics-wise. The fact that the Department of Logistics also has to give their own orientation at this time probably doesn&#39;t help, either. 

The man behind the help desk looks at me with contempt. Fair. 

 //There&#39;s no one there. How can it be the right room?//

And confusion sets in. The annoyance level of the line behind me starts rising as the guy looks up every department scheduled for a 10:30 orientation. A simple affair, really, as at any moment now, he&#39;ll go--

//No, I just checked. Mx. Thorley, was it? Scheduled to attend the Department of Unreality orientation session in conference room 72-D. If you could let the next person come up, that&#39;d be--//

//I was just at conference room 72-D. There&#39;s no one there.//

//Well, you must&#39;ve missed it, the orientation did start at 10:30.//

//Look, I was there at exactly 10:30. There&#39;s no one there. Also, what does &#34;Department of Unreality&#34; even mean?//

//Sorry, but I need to get to the next person in line. Would you mind moving?//

What else is there to do? I walk all the way back to an empty room with a severe lack of orientation inside. I stop at the entrance. Lights are on, door is closed, and the screen next to the door is right there: Department of Unreality Orientation. 10:30-11:30. I enter the exact same room I was just in, much to my very feigned dismay. I walk past an asymmetrical bagel display and an already lukewarm coffee pot and sit down in the middle of the room. Feels right.

Then I get to thinking. //This is a waste of space. A deliberate waste of space.// My conspiratorial mind reels with possibilities, none of which are actually viable in the shadowy control-oriented organization I know I&#39;m part of. But still.

Site-19 is huge. The ideal Foundation facility, even if year after year innovation flocks to other sites. How, then, is a fully prepared conference room empty? Surely someone must&#39;ve noticed a distinct lack of sound by now. //Especially// with the &#34;cool&#34; antics most orientations have picked up over the years. Let&#39;s just say that the first time someone spikes the donuts or whatever, it&#39;s novel. The next five times a department tries to pull off a gimmick, it just looks sad.

That doesn&#39;t matter though. What matters is me, right here, right now. In an empty room. Not just an empty room, but an empty room booked by the &#34;Department of Unreality&#34;. A department that, for all intents and purposes, isn&#39;t here. That means that A: the department is pulling off some stunt for its orientation in order to impress me specifically (for no real reason), or B: this room is a filing error. 

Option B sets in as the likely culprit rather quickly. The Foundation is a huge secret organization. A list of every Foundation department is bound to have mistakes. An agreed-upon dissolution, a merger, or plain old budget cuts: all good reasons for the Department of Unreality to remain a ghost. Some overworked RAISA employee didn&#39;t care enough to glance over the list of departments that requested a room, and here we are now.

As the clock signals the end of the allotted time, I get up and head for the door. I glance at the room full of an appropriate amount of nothing, and briefly ponder option C:

 //The Department of Unreality is real, and I just ate one of their bagels.//

On my way out, I grab a second bagel from the neatly organized square on display.

//Not like it&#39;d matter though. Nobody&#39;s touched them yet.//</textarea></pre>
