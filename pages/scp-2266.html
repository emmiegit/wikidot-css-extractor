[[include component:image-block name=2266.jpg|caption=File photo of SCP-2266-2 prior to containment.  SCP-2266&#39;s effects may or may not be apparent to viewers.|width=300px]]





**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2266-1 is to be kept in Storage Unit 40 at Site-209.  Storage Units 41 - 45 are reserved for newly discovered instances of SCP-2266-1 if and when additional space is required.  MTF Upsilon-18 (&#34;Black Noise&#34;) is tasked with tracking SCP-2266-2 and in pre-emptively securing all newly discovered instances of SCP-2266-1.


SCP-2266-2 is held on-site in standard humanoid containment suite and is tagged with GPS monitoring tags.  When new instances of SCP-2266-1 are activated, SCP-2266-2 is to be located as soon as possible and brought under control.  Affected individuals exposed to SCP-2266-1 and/or SCP-2266-2 are to be given Class-C Amnestics and released.

Use of force is not authorized when re-containing SCP-2266-2, unless subject has become demonstrably hostile to affected individuals and/or Foundation personnel.  Non-vital personnel no longer able to perceive SCP-2266-2 are to be re-assigned.


**Description:** SCP-2266-1 refers to a series of ███████-brand DVD-Rs commonly appearing in video stores and online third-party retailers under the guise of a copy of the now-lost 1921 film &#34;Humor Risk&#34; starring the Marx Brothers.  Contents of the disk contain snippets of the film interspersed with added content variously described as disturbing pornographic imagery and/or seemingly arbitrary footage of men engaging in silent dialogue with one another whilst an unidentified animal crosses the screen.

Viewing SCP-2266-1 in its entirety causes SCP-2266-2 to manifest in the immediate vicinity of the individual.  SCP-2266-2 is ███████ ████████, a 27 year old woman of average height and build.  The manifestation of SCP-2266-2 and/or exposure to SCP-2266-1 has caused individuals witnessing SCP-2266-2 to experience a systematic alteration in their mental faculties[[footnote]]Initial stages appear centralized in the occipital and temporal lobe sections of the brain.[[/footnote]], resulting in a neurological condition in which the individuals are unable to perceive SCP-2266-2 in any way.  

A second manifestation of SCP-2266-2 by a previously exposed individual(s) causes SCP-2266-2 to be physically unable to interact with the individual(s) and all inanimate objects within a general 10-20 meter vicinity of its location.  Previously unaffected individuals present at the time will be able to witness and physically interact with SCP-2266-2.




**Discovery:** Instances of SCP-2266-1 first began to appear in █████ regional retail outlets in ████████, Alaska in 1997.  The popularity of the horror film &#34;The Ring&#34; in 2002 led to a widespread resurgence in which instances of SCP-2266-1 began to appear in certain Blockbuster Video retail outlets, as well as on eBay and Amazon third-party merchants under its current guise (identified 20██); allegedly &#34;real versions&#34; of &#34;The Ring&#34;.

Description of SCP-2266-2 appearances varied, with individuals reporting SCP-2266-2 to manifest from their television screens or alternately as an intruder, indicating SCP-2266-2 does not always appear in the same spot.  Reported instances of SCP-2266-2 culminated in a successful recovery on █/██/2003, when a police report was intercepted detailing an individual claiming the subject had broken into the individual&#39;s friend&#39;s home, while the friend in question could not positively identify an intruder.  Police on the scene took SCP-2266-2 into custody, to the confusion and dismay of the homeowner who continued to insist no such intruder was to be found.


The connection between SCP-2266-2 with SCP-2266-1 was made between █/█/2003 and █/██/20██ when recovery efforts turned up copies of SCP-2266-1 at the locations SCP-2266-2 was recovered.  Containment procedures for SCP-2266-2 were updated at this point, and amenities were made upon recognition of SCP-2266-2&#39;s lack of involvement in this process.


&gt; +++++ Interview log 1.19.20██ with SCP-2266-2
&gt;  
&gt; (Begin Log)
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Eastwatch:** Hello, ███████.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2266-2:** Hey.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Eastwatch:** Why don&#39;t you tell me what happened, from the beginning?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2266-2:** Do I have to?  It hurts to speak so much.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Eastwatch:** We can stop and continue later when you&#39;re feeling better.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2266-2:** Nope.  It always hurts to talk.  Stallin&#39; won&#39;t help.  From the beginning, then; I woke up in my bed and saw a woman standing over me.  I couldn&#39;t move.  She looked down at me and started to cry.  I asked her name, and she smiled at me and said &#39;No one will remember your name&#39;.  So I got my phone and called the cops.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Eastwatch:** And what happened?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2266-2:** Nothing happened.  I fell back asleep.  Probably should&#39;ve done something about the woman in my room, but I couldn&#39;t get up.  I figured if I was going to die, I didn&#39;t wanna be awake for it.  Fell back asleep easy enough.  I woke up somewhere else, with two guys laughing and pointing at me.  I didn&#39;t have any clothes on, so I assumed the worst...  Then, they got up and ran out of the room.  I was shaking then, thought I was gonna have a heart attack.  So I found the bathroom and waited.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Eastwatch:** Then it happened again?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2266-2:** Again, and again, and again, and again.  Sometimes people would just ignore me.  I&#39;d leave, try not to break down again, find my way home.  Other times, I couldn&#39;t leave.  The doors would be locked, the windows sealed shut, every single object, from furniture to slender little wine glasses, would be hard as rock, and impossible to move.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Eastwatch:** What about when the agents found you?  You said you couldn&#39;t leave the house or move anything, yet you had a cell phone on you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2266-2:** I had visited that house before.  &#34;Visited&#34;.  Someone left the room just as I appeared.  I went and hid in the bathroom.  Some time later, I came out, and started touching everything, looking for anything I could move.  I knocked the cell phone off the table.  I didn&#39;t think, I just took it up and called 911.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Eastwatch:** No one responded?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2266-2:** Nobody heard me.  I might&#39;ve broken the speaker.  Speaking of which, my throat... can we stop for now?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Eastwatch:** If you&#39;d like to, sure.  I think that&#39;s enough for one day.
&gt; 
&gt; 





**Addendum:** SCP-2266-2 manifestation events have indicated an increasing number of individuals not previously exposed exhibiting symptoms consistent with a second exposure to SCP-2266.  Additionally, unexposed individuals[[footnote]]First discovered among on-site personnel[[/footnote]] have exhibited these symptoms.  Neuroimaging of exposed personnel (as well as unexposed personnel) indicated the effects of SCP-2266-2 exposure present in 70% of all personnel, regardless of exposure to SCP-2266.  


The level of SCP-2266 exposure appeared linked to a number of biological factors, including brain chemistry, temporal/occipital lobe health, grey matter, age, and sex.  As a result, it is believed that continued containment breaches over an extended period of time may result in a complete species-wide exposure to SCP-2266-2&#39;s derealization events.  In this event, containment of SCP-2266 will be rendered irrelevant.
