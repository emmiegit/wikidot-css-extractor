**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7229 is to be monitored at all times by a team of astrophysicists stationed at Area-08-C. Any changes in the gravitational field of the sun are to be recorded and analyzed immediately. 

To mitigate the effects of SCP-7229, the Foundation has implemented a series of countermeasures. These include the use of highly advanced satellites and observatories to monitor the sun&#39;s gravitational field as well as the deployment of a network of ground-based sensors to detect any changes in the Earth&#39;s orbital velocity.

##4f7ce3|**Following the discovery of the correlation between SCP-7229 and the leap-year system, the Foundation has concluded that no immediate action is required to mitigate the effects of SCP-7229 on the Earth’s orbit. Due to the public being aware of the need for leap years to adjust for a slightly longer year, the Foundation&#39;s containment measures have shifted from mitigating the anomaly&#39;s effects to obscuring the true reason for the need for leap years and maintaining the status quo of public knowledge to prevent any potential social disruption via containing the knowledge of its existence. Efforts have also been made to ensure that all historical records and scientific literature on the topic of leap years are consistent with the misinformation campaign.
**##

In the event that SCP-7229&#39;s effects become noticeable to the general public, a cover story must be disseminated to explain the changes in the Earth&#39;s orbital velocity ##4f7ce3|**and a new explanation for leap years must be devised.**##

**Description:** SCP-7229 is an anomalous phenomenon that affects the gravitational field of the sun. SCP-7229 appears to cause a significant ##4f7ce3|**periodic**## fluctuation in the sun&#39;s gravitational pull resulting in a slowdown of the Earth&#39;s orbital velocity that lasts for approximately 4 days ##4f7ce3|**and occurs on a 4-year cycle.**## The cause of SCP-7229 is currently unknown. Attempts to detect any underlying patterns or correlations with other celestial events have been inconclusive. 

During the period of decreased orbital velocity caused by SCP-7229, Earth&#39;s atmosphere experiences an increase in solar radiation resulting in a temporary rise in surface temperatures. This may lead to more frequent and severe heatwaves and droughts in affected areas. Additionally, SCP-7229 has also caused anomalies in the Earth&#39;s magnetic field, resulting in disruptions to communication and navigation systems. Despite the relatively short duration of the effect, the impact on Earth&#39;s climate and weather patterns has the potential to be severe. To better understand the impact of SCP-7229 on the Earth&#39;s climate, the Foundation has established several research initiatives including the historical study of gravitational patterns and the analysis of satellite imagery. The data collected from these studies will aid in predicting future fluctuations in the Earth&#39;s orbital velocity and developing effective strategies to ##4f7ce3|**mitigate the effects of SCP-7229.**##

&gt; ##4f7ce3|**Note: I write to inform you all of a significant discovery that may have profound implications for our ongoing research.  While conducting my routine analysis of archived documents in our database, I stumbled upon one that seems awfully familiar. The document in question was filed under a seemingly unrelated project. I hereby order each and every one of you to prioritize investigating the possible connections as soon as possible**##

&gt; **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7███ is ███ ██████ occurring during SCP-7███ are to be investigated by Foundation personnel. If any individual is recovered from an SCP-7███ event they are to be administered Class-A amnestics and released. Individuals who have observed ████████ are to be administered Class-B amnestics to prevent ██ █████ ██ knowledge of the anomaly. Due to the potential for SCP-7███ to affect Foundation personnel, all essential personnel are to remain on-site during SCP-7███, unless authorized by at least two Level 4 personnel. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** SCP-████ is --**a probabilistic**-- an anomaly that occurs during ███ █████ of ████████. Specifically, during a 4-day period within the month in which the number of reported disappearances increases by at least ███ while SCP-████ is active. 
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-████ occurs every █ █████ without fail and appears to be a self-sustaining anomaly. the Foundation has attempted to disrupt the anomaly by limiting travel and movement during SCP-████-1 in specific regions, but this has so far been unsuccessful. SCP-████ is believed to be responsible for the disappearance of at least ████ ███████████ each cycle and ████████.
&gt; 
&gt; █████████ ██ ███ disappearances describe seeing individuals █████ █████ █████ by █████████ (Denominated SCP-████-2) but no physical evidence of this ████ has been recovered. Despite numerous attempts, the Foundation has been unable to locate SCP-████-2 or determine the true source of the anomaly.
&gt; 
&gt; **Addendum:**In light of recent events, it has been suggested that SCP-███ may be connected to another anomalous object, SCP-████. Further investigation is necessary to determine the extent of this connection and any potential implications for the containment of both anomalies.
