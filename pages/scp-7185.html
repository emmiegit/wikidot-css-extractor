SCP-7185: &#34;The Lunar Enigma&#34; 

Object Class: Keter 

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7185 is to be contained within a secure, climate-controlled chamber at Site-██. The chamber is to be constructed of reinforced steel, with multiple layers of high-strength materials to prevent breaches or escape attempts. Access to SCP-7185 is restricted to Level 4 personnel or higher, and all interactions with SCP-7185 must be conducted via remote means. 

The chamber is to be equipped with multiple layers of security, including biometric scanners, retinal scanners, and voice recognition software. Any attempts to enter the chamber without proper authorization will trigger an automatic lockdown and alarm system, and security personnel will be dispatched to the area. 

All communication with SCP-7185 must be conducted through audio and video feeds, with no direct physical or visual contact permitted. Any personnel assigned to SCP-7185&#39;s containment must undergo extensive psychological screening and training to prepare them for the stress and danger associated with interacting with SCP-7185. 

The containment chamber is to be monitored at all times by at least two Level 3 personnel, who will maintain constant surveillance of SCP-7185&#39;s behavior and activity. Any sudden changes in SCP-7185&#39;s behavior or abilities must be reported immediately to the Site Director, who will initiate the appropriate response. 

SCP-7185&#39;s containment chamber is to be equipped with multiple failsafe mechanisms in the event of a containment breach. These mechanisms include the ability to flood the chamber with a specialized gas that temporarily suppresses its abilities, as well as the ability to remotely activate electromagnets that will immobilize SCP-7185. 

In the event of a containment breach, the Site Director is authorized to activate Protocol 7185-Alpha, which involves immediate evacuation of all personnel from the site and the activation of a specialized task force trained in the containment and neutralization of reality-warping entities. Any attempts to engage SCP-7185 directly are to be avoided, and the task force is authorized to use any necessary force to re-contain it and prevent it from causing harm to personnel or altering reality in any significant way. 

SCP-7185&#39;s containment procedures are to be reviewed and revised on a regular basis to account for any changes in its behavior or abilities. Any upgrades or improvements to the containment chamber or failsafe mechanisms must be approved by the Site Director and implemented as soon as possible. 

All personnel assigned to SCP-7185&#39;s containment are to be thoroughly briefed on its capabilities and the risks associated with interacting with it, and must undergo regular psychological evaluations to ensure their ability to handle the stress and danger associated with its containment. 

Any requests for experimentation involving its reality-warping abilities must be approved by at least two Level 4 personnel and must be conducted with the utmost caution and under strict supervision. Any personnel involved in such experiments must be equipped with specialized equipment designed to protect them from SCP-7185&#39;s abilities and must be prepared to activate the failsafe mechanisms at a moment&#39;s notice. 

It is the responsibility of all personnel assigned to SCP-7185&#39;s containment to maintain the highest level of vigilance and security at all times, in order to prevent any breaches or escape attempts and to ensure the safety of all personnel and the continued stability of reality. 

Description: SCP-7185 is a humanoid entity that claims to be astronaut Neil Armstrong. Despite evidence to the contrary, it possesses detailed knowledge of the Apollo 11 mission and has demonstrated the ability to mimic Armstrong&#39;s voice and mannerisms. 

SCP-7185 is approximately 1.8 meters tall and weighs approximately 80 kg. Its body appears to be composed of an unknown material that has thus far resisted all attempts at analysis. SCP-7185&#39;s body is highly resilient and has demonstrated the ability to regenerate from injuries that would be fatal to a human being. 

SCP-7185 refuses to remove the space suit that it claims to have worn during the Apollo 11 mission. All attempts to remove the suit, including the use of specialized tools and chemicals, have thus far been unsuccessful. 

SCP-7185&#39;s reality-warping abilities have been observed during Foundation experiments and interactions with personnel. It has demonstrated the ability to manipulate matter and energy on a small scale, as well as the ability to create and manipulate alternate realities and timelines. For example, during Experiment 4, it was able to create a small pocket dimension within its containment chamber, which persisted after it was removed from the chamber. 

The origins of SCP-7185&#39;s abilities are unknown, but it is believed that they are related to its anomalous composition. SCP-7185&#39;s abilities appear to be intrinsic to its nature and are not dependent on any external factors. 

SCP-7185&#39;s motivations and intentions are unknown. It has displayed a calm and cooperative demeanor during interactions with Foundation personnel, but its reality-warping abilities make it a significant threat to the Foundation and to reality itself. Due to the potential danger posed by SCP-7185, all interactions with it must be conducted with caution and under strict supervision. 

Addendum: Incident 7185-01 

On ██/██/20██, SCP-7185 breached containment and created an alternate reality within Site-██. All personnel within the site were affected, and the alternate reality persisted for approximately 12 hours before collapsing. ██ personnel were killed during the incident, and ██ were injured. SCP-7185 was eventually re-contained after a specialized task force was deployed to neutralize it. 

Following the incident, SCP-7185&#39;s containment procedures were revised to include additional failsafe mechanisms and security measures to prevent a recurrence. All personnel assigned to SCP-7185&#39;s containment must undergo additional training and psychological evaluations to ensure their ability to handle the stress and danger associated with its containment.
