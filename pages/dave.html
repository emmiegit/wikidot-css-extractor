//So we&#39;re just letting this thing eat people and turn them into oil?//

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ commentary&#34; hide=&#34;- commentary&#34;]]
This one&#39;s the first SCP I posted on-site! There isn&#39;t any particularly deep story to this one- I&#39;ve always been fascinated by oil rigs and just wanted to play around with making them even weirder than they already are. The way the floating deep-sea platforms move during storms reminds me a lot of some sort of horrible metal sea squid, and I kind of tapped into that concept while figuring out the specifics for what makes this thing tick. I&#39;m also always very intrigued by the human, behind-the-scenes goings-on in SCPs and wanted to put a little of that into my own attempt. Figuring out how to tell some sort of story through a document was definitely an interesting thing to try out.

//SCP-5146 is a 1:1 scale map of an unnamed stony island located east of the Federated States of Micronesia, possessing an area of approximately 0.53 km^^2^^.//
 
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ commentary&#34; hide=&#34;- commentary&#34;]]
&#34;Perfect Territory&#34; was inspired by a very... literal take on the concept of the map-territory relationship, and slightly less obviously by the consequences of the USA nuclear tests begun at Bikini Atoll in 1946. I purposely challenged myself to write something short, just to see how much I can carry a story on implications of character and mood alone, so this one&#39;s only a little over 400 words long.

Aaaaaand here&#39;s my 6Kon entry. Not much to say. I&#39;d been sitting on the concept for a while, and it&#39;s pretty much a condensed version of everything I wanted to write into an SCP that I hadn&#39;t gotten to yet. In other words- this is it, folks! Or, well, at least for now. Cheers.

//&#34;Look, did you really think it was possible to completely limit the effects of a drug to a single, tiny, specific part of the brain? A specific memory?&#34;//

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ commentary&#34; hide=&#34;- commentary&#34;]]
This tale was the first thing I posted to the site in general! I&#39;m a big fan of the concept of amnestics, but they&#39;re also something I&#39;ve seen used mostly as simple plot solutions and sorely under-explored as an actual, working thing- same with the undoubted myriad of cleanup crews the Foundation usually seems to employ alongside the more narratively-glamorous MTF squads. I enjoy stories about ordinary people a lot, so I thought it&#39;d be fun to dig into what work for the Foundation might look like for the people who actually have to //cover up// all the mess. I have more plans for the characters in this one, but we&#39;ll see if I ever actually get the time to write it, haha.

Aand here&#39;s a comic! Well, sort of. This one&#39;s closer to what I&#39;m used to working with, but it was still fun applying my usual skillset to something I don&#39;t get a chance to do often. There&#39;s a lot more freedom when creating comics destined for internet, not print, so I tried to take advantage of some of what that format has to offer, like breaking up traditional pages into panels separated by text and letting art bleed over onto the webpage. This was written and drawn in its entirety in one sitting, for a good friend of mine who wanted to see my take on Kondraki&#39;s character. It didn&#39;t //quite// come out as a character study, but it was still fun to do.

This one&#39;s wayyyyy out there. I do occasionally write poetry, or just stuff tending more towards the... abstract, let&#39;s say, but I wasn&#39;t sure if I could actually get away with posting something like that here. Since, as of writing this, it&#39;s still up, I guess there may be a place for it on the wiki after all? This one&#39;s also intentionally left pretty vague when it comes to the identities of the characters involved, something I don&#39;t do often- I was curious to see what people would project onto my writing on their own, without me spelling everything out for them in the text. That said, the initial &#34;Chaz Ambrose&#34; tag this got was //definitely// not on my list of first guesses, haha.

Hey, I&#39;m Dave, thanks for checking out my page! I&#39;m not terribly active in the SCP community (and most likely won&#39;t be anytime soon) but, nevertheless, I&#39;m glad to be here and to have gotten the opportunity to meet so many friendly and interesting people while I&#39;m at it. I&#39;m an artist and comic creator by trade, so while I //do// do some writing professionally, it&#39;s very different from the stuff on here- I like to look at it as a fun challenge more than anything else, and hopefully it&#39;s at least half as enjoyable to read as it is to write, haha.

I don&#39;t check my PMs here every day, but I do get to them often enough that that&#39;s probably the best way to get in touch if you don&#39;t already know me off-site. If you want to check out some of my non-SCP work and enjoy surreal, slow-burn thrillers, my long-running webcomic Nuclear Summer 1997 is available to read online [http://ns97.cfw.me here]. :]

Should I be inactive and uncontactable for over two years or delete my account without removing my works, anyone who&#39;s spoken with me directly during my time here is welcome to my articles. Should anything I&#39;ve written reach deletion threshold after I&#39;ve left, I preemptively give permission to anyone who would happen to be interested in rewriting it. Thanks.
