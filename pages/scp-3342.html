**Item #:** SCP-3342

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-3342 are to be contained at Site-103 in a greenhouse for cultivation and study. The greenhouse measures 10 m x 25 m x 3 m and is reserved for the cultivation and study of SCP-3342 only. Potato crops from Blackfoot, Idaho are to undergo monthly assessment by Foundation personnel, under the assumed identity of state agents (i.e. FDA) or university researchers. Any potato crops showing signs of black flowers shall be seized and contained by MTF Theta-4 (&#34;Gardeners&#34;). All instances of SCP-3342 are to be relocated to Site-103 for containment. In the event of a containment breach, Class B Amnestics will be administered to all witnesses, and all samples of SCP-3342 should be collected by MTF Theta-4 for transport to Site-103.

**Description:** SCP-3342 is a potato plant grown from the perennial nightshade //Solanum tuberosum//, which only manifests in the vicinity of Blackfoot, Idaho.[[footnote]]Commonly called &#34;The Potato Capital of the World&#34;, and boasts the largest potato industry in any one area.[[/footnote]] The anomalous properties of instances of SCP-3342 become apparent when they are prepared for consumption.[[footnote]]Baking, frying, etc.[[/footnote]] All prepared instances of SCP-3342, regardless of the method of preparation, alter their physical appearance, function, and composition into that of human organs.

SCP-3342 grows approximately 60 cm high, with the leaves dying back after flowering, fruiting and tuber formation. Unlike other varieties of //Solanum tuberosum//, which bear flowers of multiple colors, SCP-3342 exclusively bears black flowers with red stamen. 

All known instances of SCP-3342 have manifested after being grown from seed potatoes of other cultivars.  No known &#34;original&#34; seed potato or cultivar of SCP-3342 has been discovered as of yet; it seemingly manifests at random. SCP-3342 may be, however, propagated by vegetative cuttings (cloning) of itself.

The first known instance of SCP-3342 was referred to the Foundation by Professor ███████ of the University of Idaho College of Agricultural and Life Sciences.

&gt; **Experiment 3342-1**
&gt; **Date:** 05/25/18
&gt; **Subject:** One large SCP-3342 tuber
&gt; 
&gt; **Method of Preparation:** Baked
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** A human skull and lower jawbone. //Researcher&#39;s note: Even though the potato was smaller than a human skull, it was the size of a normal adult human skull upon its finishing.// 

&gt; **Experiment 3342-2**
&gt; **Date:** 05/27/18
&gt; **Subject:** 10 large SCP-3342 tubers
&gt; 
&gt; **Method of Preparation:** French-fried
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:**  Human finger bones, including the metacarpal, proximal phalanges, intermediate phalanges, and distal phalanges.  

&gt; **Experiment 3342-3**
&gt; **Date:** 05/29/18
&gt; **Subject:** 5 medium SCP-3342 tubers
&gt; 
&gt; **Method of Preparation:** Mashed
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** While still in the pot, the potatoes appeared as a mass of tangled entrails. The resultant mashed potatoes took on the appearance of a human liver upon plating. Dissection of the liver showed it to be a normal and healthy liver, free of defect.

&gt; **Experiment 3342-4**
&gt; **Date:** 06/01/18
&gt; **Subject:** 10 medium &#34;new&#34; SCP-3342 tubers
&gt; 
&gt; **Method of Preparation:** Boiled
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** Kidneys. Dissection of these kidneys showed them to be normal and healthy. //Researcher&#39;s note: Two things- can we choose which organ we want to produce, and would these organs be viable to transplant into human subjects? Imagine the possibilities of a world wherein no donor list was needed.//


&gt; **Experiment 3342-5**
&gt; **Date:** 06/04/18
&gt; **Subject:** 1 large SCP-3342 tuber, carved into the shape of a human heart.
&gt; 
&gt; **Method of Preparation:** Baked
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** One human heart. Dissection reveals it is healthy and in the opinion of Dr. McClendon, appears to be freshly removed from a person in perfect health.


&gt; **Experiment 3342-6**
&gt; **Date:** 06/06/18
&gt; **Subject:** 5 large SCP-3342 tubers, each carved into the shape of a different organ- one heart, one left lung, one pancreas, one eyeball, one section of small intestine.
&gt; 
&gt; **Method of Preparation:** Baked
&gt; 
&gt; **Results:** Each potato became the organ it was carved into the shape of. Dr. Connors, Dr. McClendon, Dr. Hardin, and Dr. Prime oversaw and assisted the dissection of each organ. All were observed to be an excellent specimen of each respective organ. Furthermore, it is the opinion of medical staff that, if handled properly, each organ appeared to be suitably viable for transplant.

&gt; **Title of Project: Viability of human organ transplants of SCP-3342**
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; [[=]]
&gt; **Background**
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; As of 12/28/18, 214,823 people in the United States alone currently need a lifesaving organ transplant (total waiting list candidates). Of those, 74,898 people are active waiting list candidates. 11,491 transplants have been successfully performed this year, from a total of 5,536 organ donors. The vast majority of these organ donors are deceased. Even a casual examination of these numbers reveals a staggering shortage of viable organs available for transplant.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, even if kept chilled in preservation solution, donated organs can only remain viable for transplantation for a short time, although it is best if they are transplanted as quickly as possible after the donation surgery. Typical storage times are 30 hours or less for a kidney, less than 12 hours for a pancreas or liver, and less than 6 hours for a heart or lungs. These times vary because of the relative speed at which deterioration begins in the organs&#39; tissues. 
&gt; 
&gt; Our experimentation with SCP-3342 has shown that, with adequate preparation, we can create human organs that project staff unanimously agree would be viable for transplant. The organs created are blood-type neutral, removing the burden of finding a matching donor for transplant centers around the world. Furthermore, these organs would able be given to a waiting list candidate within minutes of creation, with minimal equipment necessary. 
&gt; [[=]]
&gt; **Experimental Procedures**
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; We would like to assess the viability of using prepared organs created from SCP-3342 as a source of transplant organs for patients suffering from terminal conditions which may be alleviated via organ transplant.
&gt; [[=]]
&gt; **Resources**
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; I will be working directly with my Site Director, Dr. ███████, and Doctors McClendon, Prime, and Hardin will be joining the research team indefinitely to complete this project. We will utilize D-Class personnel that have been independently diagnosed with medical conditions requiring organ transplantation as a treatment method.
&gt; [[=]]
&gt; **Final Presentation**
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; The final format of my independent study project will be a written report. It will
&gt; include my original objectives and a presentation of my findings.

&gt; **Post-Operative Report:** Patient identified as D-5150, a 36-year old caucasian male with diagnosed cardiomyopathy. Chosen for Project Tinman 2/24/19. Patient advised of procedure and the status to the clinical trial involving lab-grown heart, but not advised of the true nature of SCP-3342. 
&gt; 
&gt; Organ procurement and preservation was achieved by [DATA REDACTED]. Transplantation was performed orthotopically by Dr. McClendon and Dr. Hardin, using the biatrial technique. Weaning from CPB was done under monitoring of right and left atrial pressure. 
&gt; 
&gt; Immunosuppressive protocol- During a stay in the intensive care unit, the recipient received 4 × 250 mg/day intravenous methylprednisolone for 3 days. Oral steroid dosage was tapered gradually within 2–3 weeks. Cyclosporine A was continued intravenously, and then orally with the dosage depending on its level in blood, measured directly after transplantation and twice a day for the following course. Long-term immunosuppressive therapy consisted of cyclosporine A (6 mg/kg/day) and azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day).

[[collapsible show=&#34;Post-Mortem Examination - 02/21/24&#34; hide=&#34;Post-Mortem Examination - 02/21/24&#34;]]

&gt; **EXTERNAL EXAMINATION:** The autopsy is begun at 1:30 P.M. on May 02/21/2024. The body is presented in a black body bag. The subject is wearing a white sleeveless shirt and navy blue sweatpants. 
&gt; 
&gt; The body is that of a normally developed white male measuring 183 cm and weighing 102 kg, and appearing generally consistent with the stated age of 41 years. The body is cold and unembalmed. Lividity is fixed in the distal portions of the limbs. 
&gt; 
&gt; Discovered sprouted from all visible orifices of the body, and also from the skin itself, are a number of plant-like protrusions, averaging 26 cm in length, that terminate in black, five-petaled flowers with red stamen. The origin of these is unknown. 
&gt; 
&gt; Upon removal of the victim’s clothing, it was found that these plant-like protrusions have sprouted from nearly all hair follicles and orifices of the body.
&gt; 
&gt; 56 bullet wounds are found on the the body. They were hard to identify due to the prolific growth of the flowers. Flesh is apposed, not swollen. There is no blood found around or in on the bullet wounds. Normally this would be indicative of a postmortem wounding pattern but due to the nature of the body, this is unclear.
&gt; 
&gt; **INTERNAL EXAMINATION:** Internal examination defies all current knowledge of human anatomy. After primary Y-incision was made, it has been discovered that the entire cavity had been somehow filled with tumorous growths bearing a strong resemblance to a potato. Further, no organs have been found in their proper places, instead, large masses of these tumors seem to have completely grown through or otherwise displaced the organs entirely. Dissection of these tumors, once excised, revealed that the tumors have the complete appearance of a potato. A biopsy of a number of these tumors has been collected and sent for further testing. A total of [DATA EXPUNGED] of these tumors have been removed from the body. Many of the potatoes have been damaged or completely destroyed by the aforementioned bullet wounds.
&gt; 
&gt; There has been no blood found in the body. The veins and arteries of the body appear more like roots than blood vessels. Water has appeared to take the place of blood in these root-like structures. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Time of Death:** Unable to be determined, as testing via livor mortis and stomach contents is impossible.
&gt; 
&gt; **Immediate Cause of Death:** Unknown, secondary to multiple gunshot wounds. Exsanguination is impossible due to a complete lack of human blood, and massive organ trauma is impossible due to a complete lack of human organs.
&gt; 
&gt; **Remarks:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

++ FOR IMMEDIATE REVIEW - Proposed updated entry - SCP-3342
+++ Changes highlighted in blue

**Item #:** SCP-3342

**Object Class:** ##blue|Euclid##

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-3342 are to be contained at Site-103 in a greenhouse ##blue|--for further cultivation and study--##. The secured greenhouse(s) will  be 10 m x 25 m x 3 m ##blue|--and reserved for the cultivation and study of SCP-3342 only--##.Potato crops from Blackfoot, Idaho are to undergo monthy assessment by Foundation personnel, under the assumed identity of state agents (i.e. FDA) or university researchers. Any potato crops showing signs of black flowers shall be seized and contained by MTF Theta-4 (&#34;Gardeners&#34;). All instances of SCP-3342 are to be relocated to Site-103 for containment. In the event of a containment breach, Class B Amnestics will be administered to all witnesses, and all samples of SCP-3342 should be collected by MTF Theta-4 for transport to Site-103. ##blue|All instances of SCP-3342-1 are to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. All known instances of SCP-3342-1, either pre- or post-metamorphosis, are to be immediately brought into containment by the nearest possible MTF by any means necessary. Class-C amnestics and memory reconditioning are to be administered to all witnesses of SCP-3342-1. Project Tinman is to be suspended indefinitely. Class-E amnestics are to be administered to all Foundation personnel involved with Project Tinman, and are to be reassigned following release by medical staff.##

**Description:** SCP-3342 is a potato plant grown from the perennial nightshade //Solanum tuberosum//, which only manifests in the vicinity of Blackfoot, Idaho. Preparing the potatoes for consumption is when the anomalous properties of SCP-3342 become apparent. All prepared instances of SCP-3342, regardless of the method of preparation, alter their physical appearance, ##blue|--function--## and composition into that of human organs.

SCP-3342 grows approximately 60 cm high, with the leaves dying back after flowering, fruiting and tuber formation. Unlike other varieties of //Solanum tuberosum//, which bear flowers of multiple colors, SCP-3342 exclusively bears black flowers with red stamen.

All known instances of SCP-3342 have manifested after being grown from seed potatoes of other cultivars. No known &#34;original&#34; seed potato or cultivar of SCP-3342 has been discovered as of yet; it seemingly manifests at random. SCP-3342 may be, however, propagated by vegetative cuttings (cloning) of itself.

The first known instance of SCP-3342 was referred to the Foundation by Professor ███████ of the University of Idaho College of Agricultural and Life Sciences.

##blue|SCP-3342-1 is a group of at least [REDACTED] humans who have each undergone an organ transplant using organs provided by Project Tinman. Each instance of SCP-3342-1, at some indeterminate point ranging between 5 to 6 years following their transplant surgery, will experience a sudden and painful metamorphosis. Subjects will begin to sprout leafy flowers identical to those exhibited by SCP-3342. These flowers will sprout from all orifices and hair follicles on the subject, as well as the eye sockets. This process takes between 2 to 4 hours, while the subject remains conscious and in obvious pain. For the next 4 to 6 hours, the major internal organs, excluding bone structure, musculature, and flesh, become displaced by dozens of instances of SCP-3342.##

##blue|Within 24 hours of this process, SCP-3342-1 will no longer display any signs of human consciousness. SCP-3342-1 does not respond to any known methods of communication. After this incubation period, SCP-3342-1 will begin walking at an average pace of 1.3 meters per second in a direct line towards Blackfoot, Idaho, walking around objects in its path. Attempts to interfere with the travel of SCP-3342-1 are met with violent resistance.##

##blue|SCP-3342-1 is only active during daylight hours. Reasons for this are unknown, but the current hypothesis is that SCP-3342-1 derives its energy via photosynthesis.##
