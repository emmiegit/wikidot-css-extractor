&gt; **Log Format**
&gt; Subject: &lt;Video title&gt;, &lt;Date of release&gt;, &lt;MPAA rating, if any&gt;
&gt; Interference Point: &lt;Where, during the course of the video, SCP-3922 was introduced&gt; 
&gt; Result: &lt;Results&gt;
&gt; Note: &lt;Notes, if Any&gt;

**Subject**: The 94th Academy Awards ceremony, during which presenter Chris Rock improvised a joke at the expense of the physical appearance of attendee Jada Pinkett Smith, in response to which Pinkett Smith&#39;s husband Will Smith got up from the audience, walked onto the stage, and slapped Rock in the face, then returned to his seat and shouted obscenities at Rock.
**Interference Point**: None.
**Result**: No changes from the original footage.

**Subject**: The 94th Academy Awards ceremony, digitally edited so that every frame of host Amy Schumer depicted her with bright green skin, and antennae growing out of her forehead.
**Interference point**: Beginning.
**Result**: A cold open shows Rock backstage, in conversation with three tuxedo-wearing instances of SCP-3922-A. The instances recommend that he not mock anyone&#39;s physical appearance, as this could make him seem insensitive and unlikable; they then suggest various other current topics he could use as subject material. Rock improvises several jokes on those topics, then explains that he can no longer tell those jokes on stage, as he just told them on camera. He assures the instances that &#34;everything will be fine, don&#39;t worry,&#34; then turns his back on them and, rolling his eyes, whispers to the camera that &#34;no Three Moons stooges are gonna tell //me// who I can&#39;t offend!&#34; During the ceremony itself, when Rock is presenting the award for Best Documentary Feature, he mentions Pinkett Smith&#39;s presence in the audience, pauses noticeably, then makes the same joke about her physical appearance as in baseline reality. Smith slaps Rock, then returns to his seat; the camera then shows Rock looking offstage, where the instances of SCP-3922-A have been watching. They shake their heads. The ceremony then continues as in baseline reality, with the exception that later shots of the audience show the instances sitting next to Smith and talking quietly with him; Smith appears significantly more distressed than in baseline reality. Forty minutes later, when Smith receives the Academy Award for Best Actor, he ends his acceptance speech by thanking the Three Moons Initiative for allowing him to stay for the remainder of the ceremony. A montage then depicts the professional and personal consequences experienced by both Smith and Rock over the next several weeks; these are largely the same as in baseline reality, except in that Smith is accompanied by an instance of SCP-3922-A at all times, and approximately 5% of people visible in the montage have bright green skin, and antennae growing out of their foreheads.

**Subject:** [https://youtu.be/MEOZkf4imaM?si=kHdkrm8dI6VzT2Vp 096-Short film][[footnote]]The attribution of the short film&#39;s production is posited to be associated with a member of the collective known as AWCY. However, the means by which pertinent information was acquired remains undisclosed and is presently subject to investigation.[[/footnote]], (2020), MA
**Interference Point:** At 5:15, subsequent to [[[SCP-096]]]&#39;s breach of containment, wherein one of the stationed personnel was terminated by SCP-096.
**Result:** Multiple instances of SCP-3922-A, armed with heavy weaponry, were observed engaging SCP-096. SCP-3922-A instances displayed utilization of standard scramble gear in an effort to mitigate aggressive responses from SCP-096. However, at 5:20, when the visual feed ceased, displaying a blue screen accompanied by the message &#34;No Signal.&#34; Subsequent, audible indications of gunfire, explosions, and distress vocalizations persisted in the background for an additional 17 minutes before transitioning to an end screen with the message &#34;Film temporarily inaccessible.&#34;
**Note:** //SCP-3922-A&#39;s acquisition of information regarding &#34;scramble&#34; remains under investigation. necessitating further analysis to determine the source.// -Dr. Avenlee

**Subject:** //Ratatouille//, 2007, G
**Interference Point:** In the montage showcasing the returning popularity of Auguste Gusteau&#39;s restaurant, just before the press conference scene.
**Result:** As Linguini and Remy look at a view of Paris within their new apartment, the cheerful background music cuts out as multiple explosions occur in the sky and white light covers the screen. The light fades, revealing an army of SCP-3922-A spaceships teleporting above the city. A voice announces that the Three Moons Initiative have declared war on France due to an alleged, millenia-spanning history of oppression towards a species of sapient, highly-intelligent rodents. Remaining footage transforms into a 6-hour war film concerning Linguini and Remy&#39;s attempts to escape the ruined leftovers of Paris. The subject of cooking is never acknowledged after this point.</textarea></pre>
