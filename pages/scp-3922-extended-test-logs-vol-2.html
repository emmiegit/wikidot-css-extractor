&gt; **Log Format**
&gt; Subject: &lt;Video title&gt;, &lt;Date of release&gt;, &lt;MPAA rating, if any&gt;
&gt; Interference Point: &lt;Where, during the course of the video, SCP-3922 was introduced&gt; 
&gt; Result: &lt;Results&gt;
&gt; Note: &lt;Notes, if Any&gt;

**Subject**: The 94th Academy Awards ceremony, during which presenter Chris Rock improvised a joke at the expense of the physical appearance of attendee Jada Pinkett Smith, in response to which Pinkett Smith&#39;s husband Will Smith got up from the audience, walked onto the stage, and slapped Rock in the face, then returned to his seat and shouted obscenities at Rock.
**Interference Point**: None.
**Result**: No changes from the original footage.

**Subject**: The 94th Academy Awards ceremony, digitally edited so that every frame of host Amy Schumer depicted her with bright green skin, and antennae growing out of her forehead.
**Interference point**: Beginning.
**Result**: A cold open shows Rock backstage, in conversation with three tuxedo-wearing instances of SCP-3922-A. The instances recommend that he not mock anyone&#39;s physical appearance, as this could make him seem insensitive and unlikable; they then suggest various other current topics he could use as subject material. Rock improvises several jokes on those topics, then explains that he can no longer tell those jokes on stage, as he just told them on camera. He assures the instances that &#34;everything will be fine, don&#39;t worry,&#34; then turns his back on them and, rolling his eyes, whispers to the camera that &#34;no Three Moons stooges are gonna tell //me// who I can&#39;t offend!&#34; During the ceremony itself, when Rock is presenting the award for Best Documentary Feature, he mentions Pinkett Smith&#39;s presence in the audience, pauses noticeably, then makes the same joke about her physical appearance as in baseline reality. Smith slaps Rock, then returns to his seat; the camera then shows Rock looking offstage, where the instances of SCP-3922-A have been watching. They shake their heads. The ceremony then continues as in baseline reality, with the exception that later shots of the audience show the instances sitting next to Smith and talking quietly with him; Smith appears significantly more distressed than in baseline reality. Forty minutes later, when Smith receives the Academy Award for Best Actor, he ends his acceptance speech by thanking the Three Moons Initiative for allowing him to stay for the remainder of the ceremony. A montage then depicts the professional and personal consequences experienced by both Smith and Rock over the next several weeks; these are largely the same as in baseline reality, except in that Smith is accompanied by an instance of SCP-3922-A at all times, and approximately 5% of people visible in the montage have bright green skin, and antennae growing out of their foreheads.

**Subject:** [https://youtu.be/MEOZkf4imaM?si=kHdkrm8dI6VzT2Vp 096-Short film][[footnote]]The attribution of the short film&#39;s production is posited to be associated with a member of the collective known as AWCY. However, the means by which pertinent information was acquired remains undisclosed and is presently subject to investigation.[[/footnote]], (2020), MA
**Interference Point:** At 5:15, subsequent to [[[SCP-096]]]&#39;s breach of containment, wherein one of the stationed personnel was terminated by SCP-096.
**Result:** Multiple instances of SCP-3922-A, armed with heavy weaponry, were observed engaging SCP-096. SCP-3922-A instances displayed utilization of standard scramble gear in an effort to mitigate aggressive responses from SCP-096. However, at 5:20, when the visual feed ceased, displaying a blue screen accompanied by the message &#34;No Signal.&#34; Subsequent, audible indications of gunfire, explosions, and distress vocalizations persisted in the background for an additional 17 minutes before transitioning to an end screen with the message &#34;Film temporarily inaccessible.&#34;
**Note:** //SCP-3922-A&#39;s acquisition of information regarding &#34;scramble&#34; remains under investigation. necessitating further analysis to determine the source.// -Dr. Avenlee

**Subject:** //Ratatouille//, 2007, G
**Interference Point:** In the montage showcasing the returning popularity of Auguste Gusteau&#39;s restaurant, just before the press conference scene.
**Result:** As Linguini and Remy look at a view of Paris within their new apartment, the cheerful background music cuts out as multiple explosions occur in the sky and white light covers the screen. The light fades, revealing an army of SCP-3922-A spaceships teleporting above the city. A voice announces that the Three Moons Initiative have declared war on France due to an alleged, millenia-spanning history of oppression towards a species of sapient, highly-intelligent rodents. Remaining footage transforms into a 6-hour war film concerning Linguini and Remy&#39;s attempts to escape the ruined leftovers of Paris. The subject of cooking is never acknowledged after this point.

**Subject**: //Minecraft Xbox - Sinking Feeling [124]// an episode of a Minecraft let’s play by YouTuber Stampylonghead, 2013, Not Rated
**Interference Point**: 15 minute mark
**Result:** Shortly after the SS Stumpy pulls up next to Hit the Targets ship, a third ship is seen in the distance. It is a modern looking destroyer with the Three Moons logo re created on the bow of the ship with blocks. Several instances of SCP-3922-A, identical to those seen in the previous 2b2t test, are present on the ship. Stampy is sceptical as to whether or not the mysterious ship is hostile or not, but becomes quite pleased when it begins to fire cannons at Hit the Targets ship. The battle mostly carry’s out as normal, with the added effect of the SCP-3922-A instances fighting alongside Stampy and L for Lee. Eventually, seeing the battle has gone into a stalemate between the three ships, Stampy attempts to summon the kraken. After all 3 ships shake violently in the water, the “kraken” is revealed to be IBalsticSquid, similarly to the unaltered video. It should be noted that upon closer inspection of the video, during the shaking shaking sequence, several SCP-3922-A instances can be seen taking advantage of the chaos to board Hit the Targets ship. After Squid boards the SS Stumpy, the gang of 3 prepare to attack Hit the Target once more, only to realize that he has been apprehended by SCP-3922-A instances. Hit the Target is loaded up onto the Three Moons destroyer, and an instance walks up to Stampy, who hands him a book informing him that Hit the Target will no longer be a threat to him and the world, “Signed: ☽☽☽”. The destroyer then leaves the location. Stampy expresses some confusion over the situation, but is happy that Hit the Target won’t be a threat anymore, and promises that the mysterious men will get a place in his love garden in the next video. Stampy then ends with his regular outro.


**Subject:** //Hololive Funkin&#39;// version 6.0.0, 2023, unrated (full playthrough recorded)
**Interference Point:** Cutscene preceding the song &#34;Haachama&#34;
**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances initially enter to intercept Haachama in a manner identical to the second loop of the previous test, but complain of having already done so previously. All characters except for Haachama dismiss their concerns, and SCP-3922-A acquiesces after a brief delay, presumably realizing that they had entered a narrative subject to an external retcon. Further changes documented by Week and Freeplay song below. Cases with no changes compared to original gameplay are omitted.

||~ Week # ||~ Original events ||~ Change ||
|| 3 || Aloe and Nene are relaxing on a rooftop after work. Botan interrupts, having been asked to look for a missing heart necklace that Nene had stolen, but decides not to take it back after singing with Aloe. || Botan&#39;s exposition to Aloe from the previous test is retained, even though no dialogue is present in the original recording. The absence of the &#34;WANTED&#34; posters removes the corresponding scenes. ||
|| 4 || Aloe goes to Coco to get clues on Sora Tokino&#39;s whereabouts, traveling by limo to a bar while singing in the process. || No changes to dialogue relative to previous test. Gameplay now takes place inside the limo instead of on top of it; Nene, Botan, Polka Omaru, and Lamy Yukihana watch from a regular car instead of a shopping cart. While this change is initially unexplained, the game&#39;s camera occasionally reveals a police car containing SCP-3922-A instances tailgating both vehicles. ||
|| 5 || See previous test. || No changes to dialogue or gameplay relative to previous test. However, Towa, Boyfriend, and Girlfriend are restored to their original places on the balcony. ||
|| &#34;Tako&#34; || Aloe and Nene come over to Ina&#39;s house for a chat, with Ina offering to sing with Aloe to round out her previous experiences. || No changes to dialogue or gameplay. However, a dormant machine resembling a modified Scranton Reality Anchor is visible in the background, bearing TMI iconography. Scraps of a device resembling those used by the Foundation to block Akiva radiation are also present. ||
|| 6 || Aloe and Nene visit Korone Inugami&#39;s house to play one of her video games; however, the console breaks from heat damage, causing Korone to become extremely violent. || Dialogue is unchanged for the first two songs, as they do not occur in the actual game world. However, the cutscene preceding &#34;D.O.O.G&#34; is altered when Korone attempts to reach for the chainsaw used in unaltered gameplay, only to recall &#34;those Three Moon jerks&#34; confiscated it sometime prior. The song proceeds as normal, but with Korone&#39;s sprites altered to use punches instead of the chainsaw to attack Aloe. Ending dialogue is changed to have Okayu Nekomata mention receiving an anonymous referral to anger management counseling on Korone&#39;s behalf. ||
|| &#34;BIG SHOT&#34; (freeplay) || Aloe and her friends fight a version of Spamton G. Spamton (from //Deltarune//) modeled after Coco in a realm resembling the latter game&#39;s Cyber World. || All five of the girls present ride their own separate carts and tracks. SCP-3922-A instances follow them from behind on their own carts with firearms trained on &#34;Spamco;&#34; throughout the song itself, notes in the shape of Spamton&#39;s Pipis present in original gameplay do not appear. ||
|| &#34;Defeat&#34; (freeplay) || Fubuki is challenged by Korone to a song battle in a recreation of the song of the same name from the //Friday Night Funkin&#39;// modification //Vs. Impostor//. Missing a note prompts an immediate lethal strike from Korone&#39;s chainsaw. || Graphics used for Korone and Fubuki revert to the visual style of //Among Us//, upon which the rest of the song&#39;s visuals are based. All Crewmates are alive and protected by SCP-3922-A instances; following the countdown, Korone&#39;s avatar is terminated by an Impaler Event. Gameplay cuts to a recreation of the //Among Us// victory screen with various cheers and jeers from the Crewmates, Fubuki, and Korone, before exiting to the menu. ||
|| &#34;Killer Scream&#34; (freeplay) || See previous test. || Dialogue proceeds identically to previous test until Aloe and Nene leave the grotto, after which [DATA EXPUNGED] _
 _
Test aborted; footage deleted following Ethics Committee liaison recommendation. ||

Repeat playthroughs of Story Mode weeks as Fubuki (recorded prior to &#34;Killer Scream&#34;&#39;s segment) yield negligible changes identical in nature to the previous test.

**Note:** //This was another test in the backlog, trying to see how SCP-3922-A reacts to retcons of narratives they&#39;ve already affected. The good news is that this flushed out whatever the TMI was attempting with the previous test, but the bad news is that they appear to have latched on to another thing behind our backs. It seems 3922-A has higher awareness of production drama affecting characters and their likenesses than we previously thought.// - Researcher Vesia
//For those of you asking why we scrubbed the expunged section, we were not aware of the outside circumstances that led to 3922-A behaving the way they did, as the relevant events transpired just as footage was being gathered. I am not interested in using SCP-3922 as a tool for gossiping on sensitive subjects - especially emerging ones like these - or a place to get opinions on such, so this will hopefully discourage any intentional repeat attempts.// - Director Naismith

**Subject:** //Dune// extended edition[[footnote]]While this film is credited to Alan Smithee (a pseudonym used by directors who wish to forfeit association with a project), its actual director was David Lynch.[[/footnote]], 1984, PG-13
**Interference Point:** During the assassination attempt against Paul using the Hunter-Seeker.
**Result:** As Paul is preparing himself to disable the device, a bullet shot from offscreen destroys it. Two SCP-3922-A instances enter to make sure he&#39;s calm and uninjured, before escorting him to an undisclosed location; claiming they need to keep him &#34;protected&#34;.  A large scale conflict can be seen breaking out amongst numerous Sardaukar and SCP-3922-A instances before Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and Piter De Vries are captured. After being taken to an isolated area, one of the instances lists both their crimes, including treason, bribery, accepting bribes, brainwashing, taking of hostages, [DATA EXPUNGED], [DATA EXPUNGED], and general tyrannical governance. They are both executed shortly after.
Duke Leto Atreides is questioned by another instance over his involvement in the Landsraad&#39;s war crimes and human rights violations, and a fleet of ships marked with the Three Moon&#39;s insignia are sent off to the Emperor&#39;s home world. The film ends with the Three Moons Initiative plotting to ensure Paul eventually becomes Emperor.
**Note:** //Huh, I was not expecting that at all. The whole point of Dune is there are no good guys, and even the protagonists are tyrants. Maybe it&#39;s because this version of the film ended with that stupid &#34;Paul&#39;s reign brings peace to the universe!&#34; bs?// - Researcher Bark

**Subject:** //Dune//, 2021, PG-13
**Interference Point:** Beginning of the film, during the scene of the Fremen rebelling against the Harkonnens.
**Result:** Fremen are seen fighting alongside SCP-3922-A instances in the Arrakis desert. When the film cuts to the Atreides on Caladan, they are shown to be executed via firing squad. The film ends with the Three Moons Initiative painting their insignia onto Carthag after seizing it for themselves and the Fremen.
**Note:** //Yeah that&#39;s more what I was expecting// - Researcher Bark</textarea></pre>
