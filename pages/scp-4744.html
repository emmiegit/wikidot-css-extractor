**Item #:** SCP-4744

**Anomaly Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** A perimeter has been established around SCP-4744; no one is to cross this perimeter outside of testing. A collection of small paintings are to be kept at the containment outpost situated outside of the affected area, which are to be used to recover anyone that should become trapped within. 

**Description:** SCP-4744 is an anomaly that affects the consciousness of living creatures, surrounding an area designated Site-223 in the Foundation database. Remaining within SCP-4744 for two to five minutes (varying between people) will cause a person to enter an anomalous coma.

People entering SCP-4744 can be protected from its effects by carrying an object that could be considered art somewhere on their person; small paintings and sculptures have proven successful, and a small percentage of photographs tested have also been effective. Comas induced by SCP-4744 exposure can be reversed by placing a viable piece of art on the person&#39;s body. 

People recovering from the effect of SCP-4744 have reported experiencing vivid nightmares during their coma. The content of these dreams varies from person to person, but common themes include darkness, monotony, and homogenisation. Universally, those awakening from SCP-4744-induced comas compare the sensation of waking up to being pulled from deep under water.

SCP-4744 was discovered when an automated distress warning was received from Site-223, immediately followed by the detonation of an unknown implosion device at the Site. The Site itself was found entirely destroyed, along with the bodies of 25 deceased humanoids. Site-223 is documented as primarily containing anomalous art; none of these objects were found in the ruins.

**Update 4744/01:** Investigation of the remains of Site-223 have suggested that it was never an active Foundation facility, and that construction of the facility itself was completed mere days before its destruction. No Foundation personnel questioned thus far were aware of Site-223 prior to its destruction, and no evidence has been found that it was ever inhabited by living humans. Autopsies on the recovered bodies revealed they were artificial constructs, and that it is unlikely they were ever alive. 

RAISA is currently investigating all information regarding Site-223 in Foundation databases; preliminary analysis suggests all information was implanted on Foundation systems prior to the destruction of the Site.

**Update 4744/2:** As part of the ongoing investigation into Site-223, a section of partially intact wall was discovered with writing on it. Carved into the wall and coloured with black paint were the words

&gt; &#34;In this nightmare prison, art is the only relief&#34;

and below that, crudely sprayed with red spray paint,

&gt; &#34;Are We Cool Yet?&#34;

This article was originally pretty different, and I had the actual Project Proposal in the AWCY? format written. It ended up being cut entirely and now I have nothing else to do with it. So, congratulations on discovering this little easter egg!


Project Proposal 2024-223

Name: Capital H

Title: Just A Dream

Material Requirements:

25,000 tonnes of bricks, concrete and other building materials.
25 human simulacra, non-animate.
1 thaumaturgic implosion detonator
A method of injecting data into a highly secure database.
1 ritual capable of variably affecting consciousness in an area (already in my possession).
Paint (already in my possession).

Abstract:

We all know they are watching, that they have the means to intercept our communications. Considering that, and the nature of this piece, I feel it best to discuss the specifics of its implementation in person.

Intent:

All of us have lost things to the Foundation. People we know, taken and locked away for daring to show the world something new. Our works, seized and destroyed by people who would rather keep the world in the dark than let them see something spectacular. The very freedom to practice our craft without fear or persecution. They take so much, and we can&#39;t fight them. They are bigger than us. The schoolyard bully five years our senior, pushing us into the dirt without fear of retaliation.

We can&#39;t fight them, and we&#39;d be stupid to try. We know how vindictive they can be. But we can send them a message. A message showing them the value and power of what we do. A message showing them that we won&#39;t just sit idly by while they try to bury our way of life.

If they don&#39;t want the world to see our art, we&#39;ll start making art specifically for them.
