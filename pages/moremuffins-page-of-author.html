[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6988 SCP-6988] ‚Äî **Contagious Omniscience**
My very first SCP! Part one of the muffinverse üò≥

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6447 SCP-6447] ‚Äî **Symphony of the Wronged**
A 10 person collab with [[*user Jack Waltz]], [[*user Elunerazim]], [[*user Aftokrator]], [[*user LORDXVNV]], [[*user Lt Flops]], [[*user GreenGolem]], [[*user JakdragonX]], [[*user Cole 13]], and [[*user MetalRavioli]]. Was very fun to make!

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6501 SCP-6501] ‚Äî **Forever Bound**
A collab with my friend [[*user Jack Waltz]], started as an entry for [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nightmarefest NIGHTMAREFEST] but derailed HARD. Now it&#39;s an emotional article.

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-tale-of-vanessa The Tale of Vanessa, Witch of the Cemetery]
My first tale and the beginning of my upcoming canon, NIGHTFALL.

[[tab Things people have said about me]]
&#34;I&#39;m out of muffins.&#34; [[*user Hexick]] said while hiding a potato sack full of my family.

&#34;Please let me out of the basement.&#34; **[REDACTED]** said, he did not get his wish.

&#34;Do you know the muffin man?&#34; [[*user MetalRavioli]] said.

The muffin man is approaching %%title%% at high speeds this very second.

&#34;Flesh necklace.&#34; [[*user NebulousStar]] said. You&#39;re better off not knowing.
----
‚ÄúYou thought there would be a clever quote here. But it was me, Golem!‚Äù [[*user GreenGolem]] said while striking an impressive pose.
----
‚ÄúYou know, when people say ‚Äúsockpuppeting‚Äù is bad, and against site rules, I ignored them. I was here since the beginning, and plotted multiple ‚Äúsockpuppets‚Äù one the site, and have built them to be major authors with huge reputations. I have taken the wiki by storm, and have gotten upvote bots into the site, to inflate upvotes make them almost meaningless. I‚Äôve influenced several shadow admins, paying them so I don‚Äôt get hurled off into the lava for my infractions. 


Huh? Oh yeah muffin is a great author and great guy.‚Äù [[*user Cole 13]] said. Very based, king.
----
&#34;Muffin? Oh no, sir, I don&#39;t touch pastries. I have a debilitating fear of those things, you see. Wait what do you mean MoreMuffins?&#34; [[*user Aftokrator]] said. I&#39;m hurt, my family and I did NOTHING to you, DO YOU HEAR ME? ABSOLUTELY NOTHI-
----
&#34;Sorry, I left the script at home. What am I supposed to say again?&#34; [[*user Jack Waltz]] said. Very forgetful.
----
&#34;MoreMuffins exists.&#34; [[*user ROUNDERHOUSE]] said. Honestly I had no clue.
----
&#34;5/7 somewhere between absolute perfection and total trash fire.&#34; [[*user LORDXVNV]] said. Quite accurate.

&#34;Gonna say some copyrighted text so you get banned.&#34; [[*user lamentte]] said. I sure hope I don&#39;t get ba

[[tab Important stuff]]
If I die, get banned, or go inactive for a year or two, ownership of my articles will go to [[*user Jack Waltz]]. He can do whatever the hell he wants with them lmao. 
(And if Jack Waltz is inactive as well, [[*user MetalRavioli]] will have ownership of my articles.)

If you&#39;d like to contact me, I mostly pay attention to discord. My username is MoreMuffins#0076, I&#39;m also somewhat active in the SCPD discord server.
