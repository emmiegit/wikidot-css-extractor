part of [[[qui-lactis | NIGHTFALL: Qui Lactis]]] [[collapsible show=&#34;►Fun Fact&#34; hide=&#34;▼Fun Fact&#34;]]

Originally this was going to be a very different piece about a pirate on the high seas and a Daevite artifact set in Nightfall. Lord convinced me at some point to write a piece for Qui Lactis, and later when I was struggling with writing he was kind of enough to join me as a co-author. Lord gets the vast majority of the credit for this one, I was struggling hard with writing at the time.

This concept is one that I&#39;ve wanted to do for quite a while but which, as I conceived of it, was too big for just me to handle. Shopped it around to a few people but nobody bit. Dug it out of storage when we were brainstorming an event for Pedagon, and Grigori joined, which had me pretty ecstatic. Unfortunately I was pretty sick during the writing of this so Grigori did a vast majority of the heavy lifting (sorry Grigori). The final piece is smaller in scope than initially conceived of, but honestly that&#39;s for the best and I&#39;m so glad that Three Moons and the Muppet Canon have something together on the wiki.

I love how this turned out but at the time it was frankly a bit of a disaster. I stupidly volunteered to handle the front page redesign for April Fools, not realizing how much I&#39;d struggle with the CSS. Additionally the artists originally slated to have art on the front page didn&#39;t end up being able to, for totally understandable reasons. It was down to the wire, asked around for some folks to see who was available to make some art and was lucky enough to get Fantem, Harry and Syuzhet on board, bunch of lifesavers. Meanwhile Estrella came in clutch with a lot of CSS fixes.

* This article is inspired by my cat Wiley, and uses his photo here as well. He also really did eat those bagels of mine, the bastard.

* In many ways this piece was written as a direct response to PlaguePJP&#39;s [[[SCP-7591]]] and attempts to be its opposite in terms of subject matter. It uses the same CSS as Plague&#39;s article and the reverse of its numbering. 

* I&#39;ve been tempted to rename this &#34;Alex Thorley Gets a Pussy&#34; a few times.

Honestly not my finest moment, though this was a coldpost contest so that was true for a lot of people. I&#39;d long been weirdly obsessed with the idea of multiple Thorleys, and then there was the clone idea I had for my AA. Eventually realized I&#39;m plural which, yeah that tracks. Portions of this are embarrassing in retrospect but I think that&#39;s okay.

I also wrote this while on vacation so it was written completely on mobile.

For [[*user syuzhet]] for [[[art-exchange-hub | Art Exchange 2023]]] [[collapsible show=&#34;►Fun Fact&#34; hide=&#34;▼Fun Fact&#34;]]
The second I got paired with Syuzhet for Art Exchange I knew I wanted to try doing something wild. Syuzhet has always struck me as having a weird sense of humor, and to an extent I can too, so I really endeavored to get //weird// with it.

As such this article includes:

[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop show=►SPOILERS|hide=▼ SPOILED MILK]]

-A myriad of references to Donald Trump, including quotes, images and implications that Trump is a high ranking member of the Department of Unreality.

- Pictures of the interior of the Twin Towers

- Pictures of cocaine products

-A Pallas Cat

-Claims of an Alex Thorley face reveal 

-A behind the scenes of the Unreality Department using lore that was either fabricated for this or taken from the fandom page on Unreality

-printing tiddy

-Water pumped from Pie Town

- Reference to [[[SCP-6771]]] Man Who Can&#39;t See Milk

- Three cooking videos (including one hidden video) of horrible concoctions I consumed in their entirety

-Milk reviews of real milks I drank

* I initially wrote this series during Nanowrimo 2022, which I did alongside Harry Blank and others. I was initially nervous about the idea, since it involved creating some lore for both Site-333 and William Wettle but Harry (who both created Wettle and wrote SCP-7000, which this is heavily inspired by) was very enthusiastic about it which motivated me to go through with it.

* Nico donated the opening and closing credit CSS.

* The only reason the rest of the series isn&#39;t complete yet is I haven&#39;t sat down and edited it since I&#39;m constantly getting distracted by other projects. Personally, I blame the ADHD, but I&#39;m working on it.

Oh, Siggy.  I started writing this series in response to having recently read [[[the-adventures-of-siggy-and-robomonkey-hub | The Adventures of Siggy and Robomonkey]]] and imagining it had a lighter more fun tone to it.  I had... a lot planned for this. Too much, I think. This was initially supposed to be a prologue. Then the prologue split into two...

//Then// the prologue split into three, and the second part didn&#39;t turn out as well as the first, and I was never happy with the third part. I&#39;ve had a sort of writer&#39;s block on the series ever since, though I badly want to get back to it some day because I //really// think Siggy having adventures in the Oneirosphere is a very fun concept. 

Future instalments were gonna include Siggy hanging out with Mr. Moon, visiting the Circus of the Disquieting,  meeting the Nightmare King, in Disneyland Oneiroi , Dr. Gears and Dir. Asheworth bonding over their shared relation to Alison Chao, Clef dealing with trauma. Just... a whole bunch of stuff. Maybe one day

Varies day by day tbh.  Mental health and shit do be like that sometimes. We are either so back or so over, and it really just depends. I&#39;m no starving artist, that said if you like what I do, and you&#39;ve got moolah to spare, consider throwing me a tip on Kofi.

[[*user DaveYouFool]]
This user //has// written a book series, Neverstone. Finished reading the second book recently, good stuff. DYF does a specific kind of comedy really well. This can be seen in Neverstone, and also on the wiki through his GOIs [[[three-moons-initiative-hub | The Three Moons Initiative]]] and [[[totleighsoft-hub | Totleighsoft]]]. Very Douglas Adams.

This user makes [[[alex-thorley-goes-on-a-blind-date | whole]]] [[[art:happy-halloween2022 | ass]]] [[[ scp-6634 | games]]] and uploads them to the wiki. If that doesn&#39;t impress you I don&#39;t know what to tell you.

If I&#39;m uncontactable for over a year (very unlikely IMO, try over Discord), order of preference for who gets my stuff/gets to make decisions over my stuff is thus:

- Co-authors get full ownership of whatever I wrote with them, do as you wish, sandboxes included.

- If no co-authors, or they too are gone: the owner/curators for any hubs (for canons, series, departments, GOIs, that sort of thing) on which I intentionally posted an article, may make whatever edits they desire to make the work fit better in their setting (i.e. for Willie Wettle Washed up While Walking dododevil and HarryBlank have explicit permission to do this). They may not choose to delete these articles however.

- Whatever&#39;s left UncleNicolini can have if they want it. If they don&#39;t, give it to Curation Team, or whatever newfangled equivalent staff has, to deal with.
