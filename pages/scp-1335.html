**Item #:** SCP-1335

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1335 is to be contained in a Standard Safe-Class Containment Unit at Site-██. The containment unit is to be fitted with a drainage system and the collected liquid is to be disposed as Level 1 Anomalous Waste. 

As of 12/██/██, SCP-1335 is to be monitored for noise emissions. Following any such emission, SCP-1335 is to be monitored for the manifestation of additional messages.

**Description:** SCP-1335 is a fortune cookie, identical in appearance to a standard fortune cookie manufactured by Wonton Foods Inc. It displays the anomalous effect of releasing approximately 100 mL of liquid every hour. The liquid released from SCP-1335 is composed primarily of water, but contains traces of lead and calcium as well as an unidentified organic compound. 

SCP-1335 was contained on 01/██/██, at the ████████ restaurant. Upon arrival, Foundation agents discovered SCP-1335 in a fountain being displayed as a &#34;genuine Buddhist artifact&#34;. At the time of containment, the restaurant had begun an advertising campaign encouraging customers to &#34;come and anoint themselves with the blessings of Confucius&#34;. The owner of the restaurant, ████ Smith, and all employees and customers present at the time were administered Class C amnestics, and a standard disinformation campaign was established. Despite extensive testing, the liquid released by SCP-1335 has not been found to possess any anomalous properties.  


SCP-1335 contains a strip of paper within its shell. Efforts to remove this object without damaging SCP-1335 are ongoing. 

**Addendum-1335-1:** On 03/██/██, after ██ attempts, the strip of paper within SCP-1335 was successfully removed using a standard toothpick. Upon examination, it was discovered to contain the following message:

&gt;
&gt; hey neighbor
&gt;
&gt; please fix your leak
&gt;
&gt; the dripping is driving me crazy
&gt;

**Addendum-1335-2:** On 11/██/██, the barking of a //Canis familiaris// began to be heard from SCP-1335. The barking continued for the next two hours. The following day, a new slip of paper was discovered to have manifested within SCP-1335. It was retrieved, and found to state the following:

&gt;
&gt; hey
&gt;
&gt; would you mind quieting your dog
&gt;
&gt; and fix that leak while your at it
&gt;

Containment procedures have been modified to account for these additional effects.

**Addendum-1335-3:** On 17/██/██, the liquid output of SCP-1335 increased to 400 mL/hour. On 19/██/██, the following note was retrieved:

&gt;
&gt; dude
&gt; stop ignoring me
&gt; i know you can see these
&gt;

**Addendum-1335-4:** On 23/██/██, disco music began emanating from SCP-1335 at 100 dB and continued for four hours. Immediately after the event, researchers retrieved the following note:

&gt;
&gt; THATS IT
&gt; IM CALLING THE FUCKING LANDLORD
&gt;

**Addendum-1335-5:** As of 29/██/██, SCP-1335 has ceased anomalous activity. Reclassification to Neutralized pending.
