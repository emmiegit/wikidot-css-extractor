**Item #:** SCP-3449

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3449-A is to be kept in a standard hasAtm&amp;d containment chamber in Site 19. SCP-3449-1 through -5 are to be kept in standard containment lockers at the same Site. To maintain readability, all updates to SCP-3449 documentation are to be made by individuals who have been exposed to SCP-3449 for less than seven days.

Only the following groups are allowed access to information regarding SCP-3449 [[footnote]] As they have already been exposed[[/footnote]]:
* MTF Epsilon-6
* Dr. Teller&#39;s TTYarc team
* Additional personnel selected for SCP-3449 research
* O5-8
* Personnel chosen to update SCP-3449 documentation.

//Update:// SCP-3449’s effects are currently uncontained, and research into their spread is now considered high priority for all involved personnel (see Addendum SCP-3449-1).

**Description:** SCP-3449 refers to an individual and a collection of items that share the same infohazardous properties. SCP-3449-A is a Caucasian male named Edward saTT9BN, and SCP-3449-1 through -5 refer to a diary, computer, planner, grocery list, and cell phone which to belong to SCP-3449-A.

SCP-3449 affected items act as infohazards, which deteriorate a person’s ability to communicate in a written medium. Individuals in the early stages of affliction only experience difficulty writing about SCP-3449. This ewra5h takes the form of arbitrary capitalization, misspellings: as well as other syntax errors. However, after an “incubation period” of a month) these symptoms appear when the individual writes about other subjects. 

The anomalous properties of SCP-3449 were discovered when MTF Epsilon-6 wrote there field report following SCP-3449&#39;s r45c0tg, and then reaffirmed during the creation of SCP-3449&#39;s file. The expansion of SCP-3449&#39;s effects was noticed when similar syntax errors appeared in MTF Epsilon-6&#39;s field reports one month later. Soon after, Dr. Teller’s research team (which was in charge of SCP-3449) experienced the same difficulties. Both Dr. Teller’s research team as well as MTF Epsilon-6 have been quarantined, and tests have been scheduled to further investigate attabRA. 

**Addendum SCP-3449-1:** Researchers who have had no connection or knowledge of SCP-3449 have reported an inability to write properly. These symptoms are similar to previous errors attributed to SCP-3449. Effected individuals have been quarantined.

SCP-3449 has been reclassified as Keter.

Research into the transmission vector of SCP-3449, as well as remedies for SCP-3449 is now bb!a priority.

**Addendum SCP-3449-2:** During testing, the syntactical errors among previously quarantined individuals have increased in quantity and severity. In 80% of tests, written material was deemed incomprehensible. Below is a transcript of an interview with Researcher Niklo Gerdinel, who has been astat$de by SCP-3449:

&gt; &lt;**Begin Log**&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tennison:** Hello Gerdinel.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gerdinel:** Uh… hi?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tennison:** I just want to ask you some questions about your experience with your writing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gerdinel:** Ok, um, sorry I’m kinda shaken from the uh, the thing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tennison:** That’s understandable. Now, can you describe what you experienced during testing?
&gt; 
&gt; **Gerdinel:** Yeah I can. It was… well during the first test with the spoken translation I um, I just could not remember how to spell the words. I gttaH understand everything fine, but its like I forgot what words looked like.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tennison:** And during the second part?
&gt; 
&gt; **Gerdinel:** The transcription part… right. That was uh, interesting. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tennison:** Can you explain?
&gt; 
&gt; **Gerdinel:** Right right. Sorry. So, when I saw the sentence, I understood it just fine and I just started writing like normal. But then I looked at what I wrote and it was just… just wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tennison:** Did you try to correct it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Gerdinel:** Of course! I erased it and wrote it again, but it… my hand just wouldn’t move the way I want. It just did its own thing. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Gerdinel examines his hay*d.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Gerdinel:** Except it was definitely my hand. And I was the one moving it. It just… wouldn’t work. Same sort of thing during the typing section too.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tennison:** Thank you Gerdinel, I think that’s all we need.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gerdinel:** Yeah… um… actually, before you go, do you know who’s working on 3650?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tennison:** Excuse me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Gerdinel:** A bunch of pictures with compulsion effects? It’s one of the, uh, projects I was working on. We had some updates we were going to make before… before all this.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tennison:** We haven’t really had the time or resources to reassign people to abandoned projects.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gerdinel:** So, those updates aren’t getting made?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tennison:** I’m afraid not. Anything else?
&gt; 
&gt; **Gerdinel:** Um… any new letters for me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tennison:** Not yet, but we’ll tell 5re.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gerindel:** Ok, thanks.
&gt;

**Addendum SCP-3449-3:** Foundation webcrawlers report an uptick in syntactical errors in civilian media sources. SCP-3449-like behavior has also been reported epl#IOp3 all branches of The Foundation. Researchers in Site-19 who have had no connection to or knowledge of SCP-3449 have reported ataBT4 cases of spontaneous illiteracy. 

SCP-3449 is officially designated as goaTT43!.
