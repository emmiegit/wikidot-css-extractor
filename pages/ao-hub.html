To quote [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-2116184 the challenge thread]...

&gt; Hello, my name&#39;s Westrin[[footnote]]The original poster of the challenge. This hub has been created in his stead.[[/footnote]], and I&#39;m here to give you a hopefully fun challenge! Been bouncing this idea around for a while, and the general consensus is that it should be a challenge thread, so it shall!
&gt; 
&gt; Pick an item from the log-of-anomalous-items, and make an interesting tale about it.
&gt; 
&gt; Here are the rules:
&gt; 
&gt; * As it says on the tin, pick a single item from the log and make a tale about it.[[footnote]]Writing your own AO specifically for this challenge doesn&#39;t count, as it kind of defeats the point. Otherwise, everything&#39;s fair game.[[/footnote]] There are no word limits, so go nuts.
&gt; * --Copy and paste the anomalous object you wish to write about at the top of the page, and then follow up with the tale.-- This isn&#39;t required any more. You can put the AO entry wherever.
&gt; * The tale //cannot// feature any SCPs heavily. It can get minor mentions, but cannot put one onto the spotlight. This is to prevent the &#34;Anomalous object getting empowered by an SCP&#34; route from being taken.
&gt; * The anomalous object must show a deeper and important meaning or have deep implications to its setting (Foundation-verse), and not just be a simple anomaly. You have to make it feel like a significant anomaly, despite it just being an anomalous object. Whether it&#39;s the unbreakable lamp being Zeus&#39; bedside lamp, or the ranch dressing banana slugs being an endangered species that introduced ranch dressing to the native Americans in the first thanksgiving. It&#39;s also encouraged that the deeper meaning makes sense to the object&#39;s nature, and is not completely random.
&gt; * Please pick an item that most likely isn&#39;t going to get pruned. Any new entries are discouraged, but you still can pick them if you want to take the risk.
&gt; * //HARD MODE:// Make the tale for one of the canons in the canon hub. Does not matter which one.
&gt; * Have fun. If you disobey this rule, you will be executed. :)
&gt; Good luck!

Feel free to format and style your entries however you want, and I&#39;m opening the challenge up to entries from the logs of Extranormal Events and Unexplained Locations -- the more tales the better!
