**Item №:** SCP-5330

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5330 is kept in a standard containment locker in the High-Security Anomalous Items Storage wing of Site-8, and may not be removed from storage under any circumstances. Testing on SCP-5330 is forbidden.

**Description:** SCP-5330 is a small, engraved metal box, secured with a latch and displaying signs of slight oxidation. The material composing SCP-5330 is impermeable to physical force and radiation-opaque, and its latch cannot be released. This has rendered its contents impossible to ascertain. 

If SCP-5330 enters the potential visual field of a human (regardless of ambient light levels), they will become subject to a series of miniaturized detonations located within their cranium. These detonations originate in the cerebellum and move outwards, invariably resulting in severe cranial damage, brain hemorrhage and subsequent expiry within 5-10 seconds of initial observation. This effect does not extend to photographs or recordings of SCP-5330.

**Supplemental Material - Incident 5330-030920:** On 03-09-2020, severe seismic activity in the vicinity of Site-8 caused a total power failure and subsequent site evacuation and lockdown, during which a significant number of dangerous SCP objects breached containment. Additionally, numerous storage lockers were compromised, including that of SCP-5330, and their contents were scattered across the High-Security Anomalous Items Storage wing. 

Assistant Researcher Marcus Cromwell was unable to evacuate and was trapped inside the High-Security Anomalous Items Storage wing, which was rendered inaccessible by multiple automatically sealing bulkheads; he was not located for over a week, as the wing could not be breached.

Appended below are several audio logs recorded by Cromwell on an emergency terminal over the first 48 hours following Incident 5330-030920.

I’m the only one left, and I’m...
&gt; 
&gt; //(Cromwell swallows audibly. The sound of an object, likely Cromwell’s arms, coming to rest on the terminal is audible.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Cromwell:** Uh, well, I’m stuck in the High-Security Anomalous Objects wing, and I&#39;ve never been in here before. It’s pitch-black, and... and a lot of the lockers are broken, and the stuff inside them fell out. All of the lockers, actually. They&#39;re all broken. I saw all the doors coming off when the quake hit.
&gt; 
&gt; **Cromwell:** And, yeah, that means 5330 is... out in the open. Somewhere in here. Don’t know where. So I can’t turn around or anything, unless I want my head to go boom. And I- I sure don&#39;t. //(He laughs uneasily.)//

&gt; 
&gt; **Cromwell:** Hello again, terminal. Right, so. I took a very, //very// careful look around while staring up at the ceiling so I didn&#39;t catch 5330 in the corner of my eye.
&gt; 
&gt; **Cromwell:** It&#39;s completely and utterly dark, even though the reserve power should be working fine, and my eyes aren&#39;t adjusting at all. Must be a side effect from one of the skips that breached or something, because this is just weird.
&gt; 
&gt; **Cromwell:** But, yeah, I can&#39;t even tell how big the room is. I genuinely can&#39;t see shit except the blinking green light on this thing. I think I can use the light to establish a baseline of measurement, though. Let&#39;s say I start at the light and take five steps, then five more... don&#39;t look behind you, Marcus...
&gt; 
&gt; //(Cromwell&#39;s voice recedes and grows fainter. Footsteps are audible until they suddenly halt, along with a faint metallic clang.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Cromwell:** //(distantly)// And that&#39;s the far wall. About twenty-four steps. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(Cromwell&#39;s voice approaches; footsteps are audible again.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Cromwell:** Let&#39;s see. If I assume the room&#39;s roughly cubical and I know all the anomalous objects are in a pile somewhere behind me, that means I&#39;ve got a ballpark of about where 5330 is. Nicely done, Marcus, if I do say so myself.
&gt; 
&gt; **Cromwell:** Right, also, this terminal&#39;s running off battery power. Forgot to mention that. I&#39;ll have to conserve it, so once more, signing off for now.

&gt; 
&gt; **Cromwell:** So, I might have a way out that doesn&#39;t involve going anywhere near 5330. A lot of the other terminals in here that cut out in the quake run on lithium-ion batteries. Useless for this specific terminal, but if I can severely overcharge them with the reserve power, I might be able to create a makeshift bomb and blast my way through the wall.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Cromwell sighs. Rustling fabric is audible as he shifts slightly.)//
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; **Cromwell:** It&#39;s my only option to escape, and I&#39;ve got to face that. This is the only way I&#39;ll ever see any light again that isn&#39;t the goddamned blinking green one on this STUPID terminal.
