**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Individuals acting as hosts for SCP-3020 are to be allowed to self-terminate through whatever means they wish. If they refuse to self-terminate, they are to be terminated.

**Description:** SCP-3020 is parasitic organism that mimi[[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]c[[/span]]s the //Rabies lyssavirus// virus. It measures [[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]l[[/span]]ess than one micron in length, and solely manifests in hum[[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]a[[/span]]ns, who are also the sole vector for SCP-3020.

SCP-3020 feeds off of the L-[[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]D[[/span]]OPA present in the human body. L-DOPA is a precursor chem[[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]i[[/span]]cal to dop[[span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;]]a[[/span]]mine, epinephrine and norepinephrine, and as such, SCP-3020 leads to a lack of these chemicals. The deficiency of dopamine causes symptoms similar to severe depressive disorders, as well as tremor&#39;s associated with Parkinson&#39;s disease

i keep on thinking that i&#39;ll let claudia look over these reports for errors once i&#39;m done with them. then i remember what i did.

its all my fault.

she was the best thing in my life. she utterly hates me. i sometimes think i can hear her screaming at night, and i want to scream back.

i want to scream i&#39;m sorry. but she won&#39;t hear me. the walls here are a meter thick, at least.

We&#39;ve been trying to cure this for over five years now. I&#39;ve worked for three of them. We&#39;re not even close to neutralizing them.

I&#39;ve reached stage 4, maybe stage 5. i&#39;ve eaten nothing but spicy food for weeks. I can&#39;t taste anything else. The tremors have started, but they&#39;re still controllable for the most part.

I&#39;ve only seen it second-hand. let me tell you first-hand how it feels.

There&#39;s a dull ache in the back of your head. You&#39;re not sure if you feel it, or if you only think you feel it. But it&#39;s always there. This same ache is also in your stomach. This ache talks, and it tells you that you need to die to make people happy.

It says you&#39;ve not accomplished anything in your life. It says you will be forgotten. It says that nobody really loved you.

And you know it&#39;s true. You know it&#39;s not true, but it is.

3020 is just going to keep spreading. We&#39;re not sure how much of the general population is infected already; conservative estimates are at 0.003% worldwide. It&#39;s going to get much, much higher.

we need to die. we. everyone infected with SCP-3020. you&#39;re doing everyone a favor. we don&#39;t want to live, and you&#39;re curing what could be the next black death.
