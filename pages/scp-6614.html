**Special Containment Procedures:** A 5 kilometer radius perimeter is currently in effect for all SCP-6614 areas of interest. All future manned missions to the Moon planned by public space agencies are to be altered, such that they are conducted outside the aforementioned perimeters. Agents embedded in astronomical organizations and space agencies are to obfuscate the results of any lunar surface survey operating near areas of interest. 

Disinformation campaigns denouncing the existence of any crewed Moon landing outside the six Apollo missions are ongoing. Any and all publications alluding to clandestine missions or lunar outposts are to be discredited by embedded agents in academia and mainstream media.

Disinformation campaigns denouncing the authenticity of Moon landings in general are currently under consideration.

**Description:** SCP-6614 is the collective designation for multiple manned landings on the Moon believed to have been achieved by various anomalous means. No less than 50 areas of interest on the lunar surface currently fall under this designation, however subterranean exploration and general excavation efforts are expected to yield the discovery of more such areas.

Following the study of artifacts in SCP-6614 areas of interest and historical documentation where applicable, it was determined that numerous states, organizations, and Groups of Interest have been successfully landing humans on the Moon since the 18th century BCE.

The following materials include documentation of SCP-6614 sites and areas of interest, sorted by order of discovery since the establishment of Lunar Area-01 in 1924.

[[/div]]

6 SCP-6614 areas of interest are presently attributed to the Xia Anomalous Culture Group due to the presence of inscriptions and documents in Old Chinese, and have been designated as SCP-6614-α sites. Translated materials present within SCP-6614-α allude to its purpose as a form of transit area between Earth and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/document-2481 Taisui].[[footnote]] A counterpart to the planet Jupiter in ancient Chinese cosmology. [[/footnote]]

Each site consists of a previously thaumaturgically sealed crater that would have served as lunar outposts. Numerous structures are located within each crater, containing living quarters, life support systems, communication systems, warehouses, and landing pads. Psychometric dating estimates that the SCP-6614-α sites are at least 3,750 years old.

Further analysis suggests that the SCP-6614-α sites had been hastily abandoned by its occupants, but due to data rot in the communication terminals, the exact cause remains unknown.

[[/div]]
[[include component:image-block name=Lagari.jpg|align=right|caption=Alleged 17th century depiction of Çelebi&#39;s flight.|width=320px]]

SCP-6614-β refers to a rudimentary rocket near a patch of dead grass in the Mare Insularum. Due to abnormal residual Hume measurements near the site, it is believed this instance of SCP-6614 was achieved by a reality bender of at least Class III. 

Analysis of the rocket indicated similarities to metalworking and gunpowder formulae utilized in the Ottoman Empire in the 17th century, leading researchers to believe that the Ottoman engineer Lagari Hasan Çelebi may have been complicit, if not responsible for this instance.

Agents embedded in the //Yedinci Ok//[[footnote]] Lit: Seventh Arrow, a Turkish paranormal agency suceeding the //Sihirlerin Taburi// of the Ottoman Empire. [[/footnote]] managed to procure the private writings of Çelebi, which he withheld from publication upon fear of accusations of blasphemy. Below is an excerpt from his journal.

[[div class=&#34;indented&#34;]]
Bismillah, I have received a revelation known only to me, and no one else. 

O my Sultan, I cannot offer anything other than my apologies and my regret. On that joyous day of the flight of the seven arrowed rocket, I truly did meet Jesus. 50 okka[[footnote]] Equivalent to approximately 64 kilograms. [[/footnote]] of gunpowder was far more potent than I had ever imagined, and I soared through the blue sky until the black night bled into it. O my Sultan, I flew to the Moon!

It was a strange sight to behold. The Moon was empty! A desert of the grayest sand to rival the dunes of Arabia. Alhamdulillah, when I landed, grass began to grow under my feet, a miraculous blessing indeed. It was then I turned to meet Jesus Himself! O my Sultan, had I not been a pious man, I would not have known this ghostly figure to be the Nazarene. 

I spoke to Jesus, asking Him for a blessing for you, my Sultan. Sadly, I must confess, I knew not what He told me. He spoke silently, but full of fervor and vigor. I spent the next hour speaking with Jesus, even though I could not hear his words, I felt them resonate in the very depths of my being, strong and moving as they were.

And so the blessings I returned with, I am afraid they are mere interpretations by this lowly servant. I pray that my Sultan will find it in his heart to bestow forgiveness.

**Addendum 6614\β\02:** Further investigations infer that Çelebi was a latent Class IV reality bender, but could only manifest these abilities in the presence of low gravity and/or air pressure, such as when he augmented his rocket to travel beyond its expected range and unintentionally grew grass on the lunar surface. --In spite of these abilities, it is unlikely that Çelebi actually met Jesus, with the phenomena being attributed to hypoxia.-- Refer to [# SCP-6614-ε documentation] for updated findings.

++* British Lunar Territory
++++++* SCP-6614-γ
[[/div]]

SCP-6614-γ is an exposed military camp comprised of multiple tents, all bearing the Union Jack on their sides and portraits of Queen Victoria within them. A raised flagpole stands in the center of the camp. Stacks of supply crates are scattered around the site, primarily containing ammunition, food preserves, blocks of tea, and coal. Documentation found within the site alludes to its identity as &#34;British Lunar Territory&#34; and is corroborated by files retrieved from HMFSCP[[footnote]] Her Majesty&#39;s Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal, Foundation precursor in service to the United Kingdom. [[/footnote]] archives. A rudimentary lunar lander located within the vicinity of the encampment was found to be technologically sound, but possessed no life support system. 

Notably, SCP-6614-γ contains a total of 50 human skeletons in full British Army red coat uniform. They were initially believed to be the remains of military personnel stationed at the so-called British Lunar Territory, but further analysis revealed each skeleton was older than the surrounding site by at least 20 years. 

**Addendum 6614\γ\03:** A portrait of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and numerous documents signed by the latter have been recovered from a crate, dated from 1863 to 1867.[[footnote]] Prince Albert is recorded to have died in 1861. [[/footnote]] Investigations into possible anachronistic activity are ongoing. 

**Addendum 6614\γ\04:** Further investigations into SCP-6614-γ have been put on hold indefinitely. Jurisdiction of the site has been transferred to the Department of Historical Anomalies due to the site constituting strong evidence to support that Queen Victoria was a necromancer.

[[include component:image-block name=swisslanding.png|align=center|caption=Dr. Orion approaching SCP-6614-δ.|width=100%]]

SCP-6614-δ denotes a landing site near the inner ring of the Korolev crater, at approximately the antipode of Tranquility Base, the landing site of the Apollo 11 mission. The landing site includes multiple discarded scientific instruments consistent with the technological development of the late 1970s, alongside the descent stage of an unidentified lunar lander.

Despite bearing many similarities to the landing site of the Apollo 11 mission, the flag planted at this site is that of the Swiss Confederation. The plaque attached to the lander reads the date 02/08/1957, the Swiss motto &#34;Unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno&#34;, and &#34;And So Taurus Surpasses Aquila and Ursa&#34; in German, French, Italian, and Romansh.

Agents embedded in the Swiss Space Office were unable to produce any documents that indicated any activities on such a scale throughout its existence. Further clarification was solicited from former Director Chris Wymann of the //Eidgenössische Komitee für das Unerklärliche// (EKU),[[footnote]] &#34;Federal Committee for the Unexplained&#34;, a governmental office serving the Swiss Confederation.

SCP-6614-ε is an astral copy of the Italian poet Dante Alighieri dating to approximately 1316CE. By technicality, SCP-6614-ε is not anomalous, and constitutes an unintended but natural byproduct of early astral projection techniques. However, it is unable to explain why it is astrally bound[[footnote]] Currently, it is understood that it is impossible to bind the astral projection of an entity that is still alive. Dante Alighieri died in 1321CE, 5 years after the creation of SCP-6614-ε. [[/footnote]] to the Moon. 

As an astral copy, SCP-6614-ε is unable to communicate directly to living entities, instead requiring the possession of an intermediary being. Attached is an interview log conducted by Dr. Priti Sharma, with D-11969 serving as a medium for SCP-6614-ε.

**SHARMA:** Just to clarify, you astrally projected yourself to the Moon to write the Divine Comedy?

**SCP-6614-ε:** Naturally. I had plans to visit the rest of the celestial bodies, but as you already know, I am what was left behind. I am the poor sod left to rot on a barren lump of detestable rock, while my replicas explore the wonders of higher realms.

**SHARMA:** Do you know why you are currently astrally bound to the Moon?

**SCP-6614-ε:** Ah, the Moon. A façade of beauty and serenity, for the Moon is in truth as unsightly as the Sins of Man. I know the religious texts to be false in one aspect. It was not God who made this forsaken realm, but in fact the Devil himself!

**SHARMA:** Hmm. Speaking of the devil, in the Divine Comedy, you visited Hell and Purgatory prior to visiting the celestial bodies. Could you elaborate on the nature of these locations? 

**SCP-6614-ε:** Why should I? I&#39;m trapped in a domain far more torturous than all the nine layers of Hell combined. The Moon does not deserve to be a celestial body, it is merely the deepest layer of Hell, furthest removed!

**SHARMA:** Alright, but--

**SCP-6614-ε:** Every second I spend on this perfidious orb is another second robbed of the eternal rest that which is promised to me. I roam this Asphodel for centuries, encountering no pure souls other than imbeciles who do not speak a lick of Latin, nor any other civilized language. 

**SCP-6614-ε:** Oh and how they frolic over the bleak and grey hills. How they fascinate themselves at my mere existence and spectral image. I pity them, for they do not truly know the Moon&#39;s cruelty. A maddening tranquility on a desolate plane for lifetime after lifetime after lifetime.

**SCP-6614-ε:** You are men of witchcraft, yes? You know the old ways? Release me from this prison, I beseech you. Liberate me from this hell. Or... or... I shall haunt you like the apparition I might as well be! You will have no rest for as long as I-- hey, wait where are you going? Wait!

++* Apollo 11
++++++* SCP-6614-ζ
[[/div]]

[[include component:image-block name=exit.png|align=right|caption=Actor Ronald Reagan descending a replica lander module at an undisclosed film site.|width=320px]]

Due to severe complications with the Apollo command module on the Saturn V rocket hours before launch, a drastic decision was made by NASA to alter the mission to become unmanned, which included the removal of almost all critical components and venting of fuel from the third stage of the Saturn V and above. During the subsequent launch, the Apollo 11 mission failed to leave Low Earth Orbit.

Fabricated footage of a Moon landing previously prepared for such a scenario was broadcasted instead, while the Apollo 11 crew were held at an undisclosed location and subjected to implanted memories of landing on the Moon. The consensus among NASA and the Department of Defense leadership was that an actual Moon landing would be postponed to the Apollo 12 mission.

SCP-6614-ζ was discovered during the Apollo 15 mission, during which all instruments and craft of the Apollo 11 mission were sighted at the predetermined landing site at Tranquility Base. The aforementioned instruments and craft of the Apollo 11 mission were repurposed into components for later missions, so the origin of SCP-6614-ζ remains unclear.

Operatives embedded in NASA alerted its existence to the Foundation, which ultimately resulted in the implantation of memories that the Apollo 11 mission was a success in all current and former NASA employees with the cooperation of the PENTAGRAM.[[footnote]] Occult branch of the United States Department of Defense. [[/footnote]] Later on-site investigations by Foundation personnel have confirmed several minor discrepancies at Tranquility Base, with an excerpt of the most significant instances listed below.

* Footprints around the landing site are inconsistent with the boot patterns of the Apollo spacesuit.
* Most of the instruments are nuclear-powered as opposed to being solar-powered.
* The plaque on the Lunar Module is signed by John F. Kennedy instead of Richard Nixon.
* The planted flag possesses 70 stars, all of which are upside down.
