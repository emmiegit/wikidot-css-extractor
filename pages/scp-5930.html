[[size 125%]] **Special Containment Procedures** [[/size]]
Propaganda operations portraying SCP-5930 as a pentecostal cult are at all times in action to prevent further popularization attempts by members of the organization. Any attempts at information spread will be obstructed. Two security guards accommodated in the area are actively disguised as prominent members of Gylbo Parish in order to deny civilians participation in any of its activities. Under no circumstances may staff personnel participate in these activities. If any properties within Gylbo are released onto the real estate market, the SCP Foundation is to immediately purchase these.

[[size 125%]] **Description** [[/size]]
SCP-5930 designates an ecclesiastical organization and territorial entity known as Gylbo Parish in Gylbo, Värmland, Sweden. The object encompasses the region of Gylbo Parish as it was geographically and administratively organized before the 20th century. The hierarchical structure of the organization follows the structure of the parishes prominent in Sweden from the medieval ages to the year 1862 (cf. [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socken|socken]]]). SCP-5930 primarily functions as a memetic agent spreading SCP-5930-1. 

SCP-5930-1 is the religious doctrine that is gradually imposed upon subjects engaging in the activities of Gylbo Paris. The doctrine is based around the concept ‘divine love’, interpreted as the infinite affection to God. The implications found during Project Cupiditas was that anyone under the influence of SCP-5930-1 will devote their love entirely to the church and anyone they are attracted to without ever losing the sense of attraction. Subjects under the influence of SCP-5930-1 will never be able to lose their devotion to a love interest or the church no matter what they will be forced to endure. This means that subjects under the influence of SCP-5930-1 do not make any attempts to uphold contents of life as life is seen as infinite.

{{**Dr. Fleming:** Good morning Agent.}}

{{**Agent Ritz:** Good morning.}}

{{**Dr. Fleming:** Now, you have been delegated to survey the religious cults that reside within the western parts of Sweden. Correct?}}

{{**Agent Ritz:** Yes.}}

{{**Dr. Fleming:** And you have in particular examined the organization in Gylbo, participated in weekly sermons and conversed with its members?}}

{{**Agent Ritz:** Parish Gylbo, yes I have.}}

{{**Dr. Fleming:** Can you tell me about these sermons, what do these surround?}}

{{**Agent Ritz:** Overall, I can say that I feel enlightened. I have finally been able to experience true love, and true belief.}}

{{**Dr. Fleming:** Hrm, okay. This is your personal experience. My question is about the sermons. What information did you get out from the sermons?}}

{{**Agent Ritz:** Information... Yes, I was supposed to tell you... There are many joyful people and pleasantries involved within Gylbo. We work together, in order to reach God.}}

{{**Dr. Fleming:** And again Agent I am asking, what information do these sermons contain?}}

{{**Agent Ritz:** We listen to his word. We worship God through the one true love.}}

{{**Dr. Fleming:** And h--}}

{{//Agent Ritz straightens up defensively.//}}

{{**Agent Ritz:** It is through the love of our closest, our closest to God that we may reach salvation. And I John saw the Holy City, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And there came unto me--}}

{{**Dr. Fleming:** I&#39;m not interested in this. It&#39;s not what we are here for. Stop.}}

{{//Dr. Fleming pauses.//}}

{{**Dr. Fleming:** Is there any opposition against the board of the parish among the parish members?}}

{{**Agent Ritz:** Opposition? We are loving of each other and the church. Why would we find any kind of antagonism?}}  

{{//Ritz chuckles.//}}

{{**Dr. Fleming:** Right. Have you ever had any religious duties or engagements within the religious community before the encounter with SCP-5930?}}

{{**Agent Ritz:** Before my engagements at Gylbo Parish?}}

{{**Dr. Fleming:** Oh, yes, yes.}}

{{**Agent Ritz:** I assure you I attended church meetings almost every Sunday. My connections to god were no different from anyone else in my area. I, eh, need to say I was very appropriate in my beliefs.}}

{{**Dr. Fleming:** Agent, I do not find this earlier engagement you mention as particularly interesting. As you say, it was no different from anyone else in your area. I am mainly talking about obligations within the Church of Sweden.}}

{{//Ritz turns red.//}}

{{**Agent Ritz:** Well uh, I may not have, eh, contributed in the same regard before to the church. But this must be explain--}}

{{**Dr. Fleming:** Agent, a lot of your closest co-workers here at the foundation have pointed out that you, since your encounter with SCP-5930 significantly have changed your manners and way of life. That you have gone from merely recognizing God to taking dutiful occupations within Gylbo Parish.}} 

{{//Ritz affirms this with furrowed eyebrows and distinctive nodding.//}}

{{**Dr. Fleming:** Is it true, that you have willingly agreed to, among other things, be a leader in weekly Sunday schools for children, partake in rebuilding a cobbled wall surrounding Gylbo church and host monthly nature hikes in the name of Gylbo Parish?}} 

{{**Agent Ritz:** Yes of course. But it is only out of our affection for God that we contribute to the society and nothing else. Surely, Doctor Fleming must understand that this engagement must be the answe--}}

{{**Dr. Fleming:** Stop. I don&#39;t wanna hear it. I think we&#39;re done here.}}

{{With this notice, it is of the board&#39;s intention to inform staff at site-80 of the delicate matter that is Operation Agape. Since its inception, the operation has caused the spread of unsubstantiated claims and rumors on site. In some cases, these have developed into accusations of the ethicality in the operation. }}

{{The board strongly neglects that any part of the operation is executed without professional conduct. Operation Agape is put in place in order to substantially limit the spread of SCP-5930-1 by termination of SCP-5930. Persons of interest are NOT punished in any way incompatible with the rules of conduct. Any personnel deliberately spreading such claims in the future will be penalized. }}

{{Thank you.}}

++++ {{NOTICE FROM THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF SITE-80}}

{{With this notice, it is of the board&#39;s intention to inform staff of some of the details concerning SCP-5930. Again, there have been mild rumors circulating site-80 on the nature of this SCP. While these still are not tolerable, the board has decided that it would deem appropriate to publicly announce some of the new research discoveries when it comes to SCP-5930.}}

{{What in its entirety constitutes SCP-5930 is still unclear; however PoIs with heavy obligations in Gylbo Parish have been interrogated, tested and deemed non-anomalous. Amnestics have had no effect on any anomalous behavior. The object still functions as an anachronistic memetic agent. Therefore, SCP-5930 will continually be designated as the administrative organization that is Gylbo Parish.}}

{{Furthermore, all staff should be aware of the fact that the memetic influence designated as SCP-5930-1 is an anomaly and nothing else. Any personnel stating otherwise will be penalized.}}

{{Thank you.}}

-----

{{By this day Project Cupiditas have been in practice for a year, with the aim to investigate the internal workings of SCP-5930 as well as the spread and processes of SCP-5930-1. This document summarizes the biggest advancements made during the period.}} 

{{SCP-5930 encompasses the entire former Gylbo Parish as it was geographically organized in the 19th century. Since its upcoming in the 1930s and latter destruction in 1938, it has resurrected. The reason behind this was thought to places of worship; however, Project Cupiditas has shown that it rather was an effort exercised by a collective of PoIs that happened to come across Gylbo at the time. The common anomalous property in these PoIs is a meme designated SCP-5930-1.}}

{{D-13480 has since his deployment in Gylbo Parish been subjected to the memetic agent and confirmed affected by SCP-5930-1. The meme can not by the accounts of his personal records have a significantly strong effect. The subject shows zero to few behaviors that are distinctly anomalous. Cognitive and physical attributes remain unchanged. As the subject has changed his behavior and affective sides in few ways determined as directly corresponding to the effects of SCP-5930-1, the project team have been enquiring whether the project should be called off.}}

{{However, since the long-term effects of SCP-5930 may not yet be discernible, Project Cupiditas has been prolonged until further notice.}}

{{It has come to our attention that D-13480 who posed as the main subject for Project Cupiditas this morning was found deceased in his provisional home in Gylbo. The probable cause of death was a hematogenous spread of bacteria to vital organs as a result of Toxaemia.}}

{{The research team have concluded that the death of D-13480 must be considered as indirectly caused by SCP-5930-1. Firstly, autopsy results found a wound that presumably was first infected earlier in September. The wound had not been treated by antiseptics and no traces of antibiotics was found in the subjects body.}} 

{{Secondly, a review of death cases in the region of Gylbo during the years 1948-1950 revealed apparent irregularities. A comparison was made between Gylbo and the average in Sweden per capita.}}

* {{6 of Toxaemia or Sepsis (cf. 2 in Sweden per capita)}}
* {{8 of Influenza (cf. 3 in Sweden per capita)}}
* {{2 post-birth deaths (cf. 0 in Sweden per capita)}}
* {{4 of drowning (cf. 2 in Sweden per capita)}}
* {{11 of Pneumonia (cf. 1 in Sweden per capita)}}
* {{3 of food poisoning (cf. 0 in Sweden per capita)}}

{{The source of the aforementioned death causes can be found within the effects of SCP-5930-1 since it relativizes all notions of finite life. Subjects under the influence of SCP-5930-1 do not recognize any attempts to uphold or nurture life, as life is seen as infinite. Antibiotics and medical treatment is therefore seen as irrelevant in Gylbo Parish. This results in a higher death rate, and lower life-expectancy in Gylbo Parish compared to Sweden as a whole.}}

{{With the insights that Project Cupiditas have collected, the research team has decided to  reclassify the risk class of SCP-5930 from Caution to Warning and determine the project concluded.}}
