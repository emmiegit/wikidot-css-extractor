A Black Rose: It’s been a while, dad. 

A Broken Watch: It has indeed. 

BR: Are you even my father?

BW: Of course not. I thought I raised you smarter than that. 

BR: You didn’t raise me at all. You just tortured me. What kind of kid learns thaumaturgy and pataphysics? No mother, no friends, all I had was you. And you didn’t once acknowledge me. I loved you, and you twisted that love into hate, hate for the world. 

BW: It worked, didn’t it? You’re smarter, stronger, and more efficient than the others. 

BR: So you isolated me, alienated me even from those like me. Imagine finding an organization of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/black-queen-hub | people just like you]]], and you don’t fit in. They united because they were alienated, and I am alienated from them.

BW: You don’t need them. What do they even want? To destroy the Foundation? It’s impossible. Do they want to make up with their fathers? Pointless. When was the last time they did anything worthwhile? When they took over a part of the Library? That was all that Green one, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/codename-green-king-hub| Josephine]]] was it? 

BR:  How’d you even know about them? I mean you clearly knew about them before I was born. What are you? You’re not like the others. You care about me. None of the others do. 

BW: My dear, the Foundation [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/welcome-to-delta-t| beat time]]] ages ago. [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4260| Death too]]]. I’m a lot older than you can imagine, perhaps more so than anyone can. 

BR: Why me? Am I useful to the Foundation? Is that why you created me? 

BW: No, you are an error. I am a man prone to emotions. As I tend to not display, the inward processes intensify. 

BR: I see, so pity it is. That’s my existence then. 

BW: Not pity, love. 

BR: I don’t love you and I never will. 

BW: I am aware. 

BR: I delved deep into the Foundation, deeper than anyone else. And 2000’s just the tip of the iceberg, isn’t it? I know all about the Council, how many times have they been [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/djkaktus-s-proposal-iii | killed]]] or [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ecceperago | replaced?]]] But always some remain. I found vague records of a catastrophic failure of 2000. Additionally, there is tell of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5000 | other ways]]] of resetting the world. I even had a [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/expanded-biography-of-the-administrator | conversation]]] with the Administrator. Didn’t get much out of it, but he led me to you. 

BW: I see. So the truth is it? [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/incident-zero-part-1 | Incident Zero]]], 2000 failed and the world ended. However, the Foundation sent someone on a suicide mission. To rebuild the Foundation, in a new universe. 

BR: That’s you? 

BW: Indeed. And I found you, my little [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dandelions | dandelion]]]. 

BR: So, I’m the result of a suicide. 

BW: How so? 

BR: Another world died, and I’m all there is to show for it. The only difference in a world that follows the same story. 

BW: That’s not true, this new Foundation is better, resurrected one could say. 

BR: It would’ve happened that way anyway. I’m the only result. I bet in the original world, I was part of the collective, a Queen. Now, I’m no dandelion, I’m a rose. A rose, thorny with the thought of beauty, surrounded by darkness. In the darkness, you can’t make out the shape or color. I’m formless, not even anomalous, just a shadow of existence. 

BW: I’ll always be there for you, my love. 

BR: What if the world ends again? Ah I see, you’ve done it many times before. How many? … You don’t even know, imagine that? And in a rage you made me, like Athena bursting out of Zeus’ skull. I’m sorry to say that I’ll be living long past this pitiful world. 

BW: I don’t know how many I have left in me. I’m no Bright, not immortal, nor depraved. I’m no Clef, I’ve seen the sun go out many a time. I’m just a broken watch, Ticking and ticking away. But I skip seconds, minutes, hours, years. I’ve lost track of everything. I can’t lose you too. 

Alison: This is goodbye. I’m sure we will meet again, throughout the worlds and stories. But I have never belonged to you and never will. 

Charles: Goodbye. I love you. Though the Foundation will doubtless outlive the both of us. What is existence without the struggle? I will fight with all my might for the Foundation. 

Alison: And I will find out everything about your Foundation. And I will use it to build a greater world than you could ever dream of. A better world than anyone could ever dream of. What else is a Foundation good for, but to build atop it?</textarea></pre>
