**Item #:** SCP-6826

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6826 is to be kept in Weapons Locker 12-G while not in use. Only researchers of Level 2 security clearance or above are allowed to access it.

**Description:** SCP-6826 is a pump-action Winchester Model 12 shotgun. In terms of appearance, it bears almost no differences to a regular shotgun of its type, albeit its serial numbers have been scratched off, seemingly on purpose. Disassembly of the gun proved no anomalous components, although the tilting bolt, sear and trigger mechanism display minor wear. Despite having all the parts needed to function, SCP-6826 cannot fire. Extensive repairs have been conducted to attempt to make SCP-6826 fire, but to no avail. If someone is trying to look into the barrel while SCP-6826 is cycling shells, regardless of distance, SCP-6826 will refuse to load munitions, and instead will simply eject the shells in the same condition they were in pre-loading. This propagates the question if SCP-6826 can see, since it seems to have some sort of perception that can detect when someone is looking inside of it.

The anomalous properties of SCP-6826 appear when ammunition is loaded into the tube magazine and then cycled through the tilting bolt. Loading a normal unused shotgun shell into the gun and then cycling it shows no effect, but when an already fired shell is inserted into the tube and then cycled, the round will be restocked with gunpowder, a new primer, wad and case, and fresh projectiles. SCP-6826 is essentially able to &#34;reload&#34; fired shells. It is unknown how SCP-6826 is able to produce these materials. When these new shells are loaded into a normal shotgun of its caliber, they can be fired without any adverse effects. SCP-6826&#39;s smoothbore barrel does not need to be changed to accept different gauges of shells. Despite the gauge limitations of a normal Model 12 shotgun (being limited to only 12, 16, 20, and 28 gauges), SCP-6826 is able to accept much larger or smaller gauges which would be unable to be inserted into a regular Model 12. These gauges range from 0 and 1 gauge (used in punt guns) all the way down to much smaller sizes such as .410 Bore. It can also accept different ammunition types (slugs, flechettes, incendiary rounds, blanks, etc). On some occasions, the projectiles of an unfired shell produced through SCP-6826 are changed to much more unconventional objects. Projectiles seen have ranged from confetti, marbles, gumballs, jelly beans, oyster crackers human teeth, pebbles, crumpled up wads of paper, fingernails, toenails, and other randomized items. A wide range of powders have also be seen in a shell, such as flour and powdered salt. On very rare occasions, liquids have been loaded into a shell. These can vary from water, milk, mercury, blood, crude oil, honey, soda, juice, wine, beer and other beverages. Some liquids produced from SCP-6826 would normally be impossible to contain in a shell, such as molten lava and nitric acid. The probability of randomization varies between gauges. If the gauge is low, then it has a much less chance of being randomized. Standard gauges, such as 12 and 20 have a higher chance to be randomized. Sometimes, SCP-6826 will eject shells with a note attatched to them. These notes usually warn the user of the shell&#39;s contents if it is randomized, although some notes can be an attempt for SCP-6826 to &#34;talk&#34; to its user or others around it. Provided is a table describing multiple testing results of SCP-6826&#39;s loading properties.
