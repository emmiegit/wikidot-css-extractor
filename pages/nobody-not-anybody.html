The outsider stands in a palace adorned in glistening gold. The halls are lined with ornate marble and littered with the wealthy elite engaging in conversations concerning matters of which they possess neither knowledge nor interest.

However, the outsider seems to be shocked after his [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/ricordi-di-un-nessuno realization].

— Damn, your memory must have been wiped hard after the bust — says a young man in the corner.

— Tell me already, who has the better music? — An old man grumbles, clearly bored.

— I&#39;ll tell you later. Do you have any more music? —

— There&#39;s a jukebox upstairs, has some good songs. — The young man replies.

— Alright, I&#39;m leaving —The Outsider says while walking off.

— I&#39;m telling you, stop inviting random people here. He didn&#39;t even say which one was better — The old man sighs.

The Outsider keeps walking until reaching a corner. He looks through the window, rain still pouring through the streets of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/locations-of-interest#goricna Gorična]. He doesn&#39;t know what to think, was he part of a gang? Why does the music remind him of his past? The Outsider&#39;s mind is scattered, his memories obscured by a thick fog.

Distracted, he shakes his head. The Outsider enters the elegant elevator, all is quiet except for the smooth jazz music serenading in the background.

//*Ding*//

He steps outside the elevator.

The second floor is much the same as the bottom floor, just more relaxed. The carpet is a deep crimson with dark gloomy lights barely illuminating the way.  He notices the jukebox tucked away with only a lone figure standing beside it.

— Outsider, you came to use the jukebox? Not many people come up here. — Says the figure, noticeably using his cigar.

— Say, can you pick number 13? —

— Ah, &#34;The meeting&#34; It&#39;s a good song. —

He inserts the coin and presses number 13 in the jukebox.

The music is rough and interesting, making him suddenly start to remember a wave of memories from his past.

A small warehouse, seems to be the middle of night. Large swaths of dust covers the building, barely making him able to see. In front of him is a large desk. A man is sitting on the chair on the opposite side, they wear a small bowler hat, a suit and sunglasses even though they are indoors.

—  Nobody, we&#39;ve done quite well in the shadow so far since you&#39;ve been our leader. I think we&#39;re ready to do a smuggling operation. There&#39;s a truck full of amnestics heading towards Vienna, transport it and we&#39;ll get a share of the money. — The man says.

He doesn&#39;t know what to think. At first he was nominated to help lead the fight against the MCD government, however some of the other members started to do more violent and Ilegal crimes. Technically he was still the leader of the shadow but If he left then he would be certainly shot down by the other gang members .

But then again, he didn&#39;t agree to any side. He was his own self, Nobody, not loyal to some ragtag gang or a corrupt government. He made up his mind, he was going to leave.

— Yeah, sure. I&#39;ll be up for the job. —

— Excellent, I knew I could trust you. See you tomorrow. —

Nobody got up and walked out of the warehouse, terrified on what could happen next.

The music stopped.

— So what do you think about it? —

— Yes... It was... interesting. —

— Y&#39;know Outsider, we haven&#39;t talked very much since the bust. I know it wasn&#39;t you, but it&#39;s a shame what the media told about you. —

—Who are you? I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever talked. — The Outsider said, confused.

— You don&#39;t remember me? That&#39;s strange. —

— How about number 7, &#39;&#39; Runaway.&#34; —

— Okay, fine. —

The man with the cigar inserts another coin and presses number 7.

Yet again, this transports him back to memories he didn&#39;t even know he had.

The music was sharp and sudden.

//Flash//

The Outsider looks around, it&#39;s night. He&#39;s running away from the gang before sunrise back home for his life. The gang is powerful, they&#39;ll find a way to make him pay. He turns around the corner, away from the warehouse and keeps running.

//Flash//

Home, finally home.  A sense of warmness and comfort fills the air. Yet he doesn&#39;t feel safe, even here. A few days later, there&#39;s a knock on the door. Police.

— Can I help you? — Nobody asks.

— We have reason to believe you have been using, selling and transporting drugs. Come with us. —

— You must be mistaken. —

— Save it for court. —

//Flash//

A courtroom, large and open. All around he sees people he recognises: the young man, the man with the cigar. On the other side of the room lies the same officer that arrested him. He knew that the Officer looked similar to somebody, he just couldn&#39;t place who it was.

— Nobody, how do you plead? — The Judge says.

— Not guilty, your honour. — Nobody answers, still confused.

— Officer, you may start. —

— Your honour, we have searched his home and found large amounts of amnestics in his drawers. Along with this we have documents confirming he has been selling and smuggling amnestics. —

While the officer is talking, he realizes something. The officer has a grin on his face and Nobody could swear he remembers the same officer being bribed by the shadow in the police station earlier..

They must have sneaked amnestics into his home and foraged documents before arresting him with a corrupt officer as a means of revenge.

— Your honour, that officer is corrupt. He accepted a bribe with the Shadow of Chicago in order to arrest me with fake evidence.—

— The officer is not corrupt.  No such evidence exists of a bribe and the amnestics have been confirmed to be real. —

—What!? —

Silence. His heart is racing with stress, anxiously waiting. It feels forever before the judge makes a verdict.

— Nobody, we have found you guilty of selling and transporting illegal drugs. However as we are a fair society, as part of your punishment, your memories will be wiped, you will have a new name and you&#39;ll be able to re-enter society. —

//Flash//

A brief vision, people are standing around him in some sort of lab. There are devices around him and on him. Suddenly a jolt of energy comes and he blacks out.

The music ends yet again.

— I know who I am now. Nobody. — He says.

— Oh, you remember? —

— Yes, and now I&#39;m finally going to take revenge on the gang and this terrible dictatorship once and for all. —

— Gang? What are you going to do? —

Nobody starts to walk out filled with desire of revenge. He knows that there&#39;s a party for the wealthy near the outskirts of the city where the judge and the leader of the  shadow is. The only problem is that Nobody isn&#39;t invited.

He passes the young boy and the old man on his way out.

— Finally you&#39;re back.  Now decide. — The old man says, visibly grumpy.

— I have to go do something, but the boy with the red scarf has better music. — Nobody replies while walking away.

The young boy smirks over the visibly frustrated old man.

Nobody strides out of the palace into the rising morning sun. The snow-capped mountains showcase the beauty of this region of northern Italy.

Armed with only a pistol and a few homemade bombs that the officers didn&#39;t take, he gets in a dingy old black van and starts driving along Gorična to the mountains.

Eventually, he makes it there. However, Nobody knows that they&#39;ll keep kick him out soon.

Luckily, Nobody seemed to be a master of disguise, an empty slate able to seemingly morph into anyone.

Putting on the disguise and with a stolen identity card, he strolls out of the van and no one bats an eye.

The mansion itself is huge with stone pillars decorated with intricate historical patterns. It  reminds him of the palace earlier but more grand and rich, almost too much. It felt so rich that it seems almost impossible to fully describe it.

Nobody goes past the stern elite, mostly quiet, only talking to their bodyguards and trusted friends.

He sees an elevator and begins to go inside of it. It begins to head down.

This elevator was much more cold, filled with heavy metal walls on the sides. No music, just descent.

It suddenly stops and the door opens. The room following the elevator is small and cramped. Outside the view of any bystanders, Nobody begins to place a few miniature homemade bombs just in case he had to escape. Although they were small, they certainly packed a punch.

Once finished, he walks into the main room. A party, flashing lights, much more energetic than above and a perfect cover for Nobody to blend in.

Out of the corner of his eye, he sees the judge walk into a side room. Even though he was wearing different clothes, Nobody could recognise him from a mile away.

Once inside the side room, he confronts the judge.

— Ah, Outsider. Good to see you here. — The judge says, almost drunk.

— The names Nobody. and I&#39;m here to end your unfair corruption against the people of Gorična. —

— Yeah sure enough, what are you going to do? — While chuckling to himself.

In the blink of an eye, Nobody takes out the pistol and fired at the judge.

The deadly sound of the bullet firing made the whole room go silent. The judge&#39;s body falls to the ground from the chair, blood spilling out of his body.

Just then, the second in command of the gang along with some of the other senior members.

— We&#39;ve been looking for you, Nobody. I&#39;m surprised you&#39;re here, you really thought you could fool me with that cheap disguise? —

He looks at the body of the judge.

— I see you killed him, he was always a good asset of the team. Although I would have rather liked to see you dead than still alive right now, but luckily I can finish the job right now. —

The rest of the shadow members begin firing at Nobody. Realising the gravity of the situation, he begins to run back into the main room.

Unable to find him, the gang begins firing into the crowd causing a wave of ear piercing screams.

— Come on Nobody, where are you? — The second in command shouts.

Spotting him, he begins to chase Nobody back into the room before the elevator. Once in the room, the crowd forces the door connecting both rooms shut.

Just in time, Nobody makes it into the elevator and the door closes.

— Let me in, you little - You will never be anybody, just a pathetic- — He screams at Nobody.

— You&#39;re right, I&#39;m not anybody. I&#39;m Nobody. —

The elevator begins to ascend.

A few seconds later, a large explosion is heard.</textarea></pre>
