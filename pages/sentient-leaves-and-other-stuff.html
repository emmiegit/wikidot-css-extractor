Sometimes he can be seen in the halls of the library. Though never a mind for fancy ramblings or verbose texts, he&#39;s often feeding his hunger for knowledge from the stack of volumes gathered on his desk. Other times he&#39;s writing down his latest idea on a spare paper, whether the paper ends up in the trash bin when it&#39;s done is anyone&#39;s guess.

Though not a member of the Hand, his allegiance has always been a matter of question.

Rumors circulate he lives a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/funny-parodies-and-other-stuff double life with The Jailors]. Wearing a false human face as a scientist named //Charley Lucian//.  If this is true, he&#39;s never used his knowledge to bring the Hand or the Jailors to benefit or harm.

In the end, his one true allegiance might just be to whatever he happens to find interesting today.

By far the most famous work from this author. An epic telling of the history of the Plant Kingdom from sunrise to sunset. Though currently unfinished, the contents of this work were big enough to warrant the creation of their own shelf.

//Tales from Spears to Flowers// gives a thorough account of the world of the Plant Kingdom, from its highest Kings to lowest Peasants. Its times of peace and war, its multitude of different inhabitants, and perspectives from those that inhabit it.

These two tales were composed in conjunction with the first two themes of the Library&#39;s //[https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/scavenger-hunt-contest Scavenger Hunt]// event (some say a third entry didn&#39;t make the cut and has been lost to time). But some think there might be more to these stories than a simple colonial tale. Psychotic himself bears a striking resemblance to the native creatures of //Mandilus 48d// after all.

Besides that, the events which unfolded on that planet are well-remembered. The //Diary of Akhom//, also known as //Philae-436//, is a personal journal from the perspective of one such //Dwelf// watching the destruction of his home. For those who want a different perspective, and some more context, the essay //Mandilus-48d// might be of interest.
