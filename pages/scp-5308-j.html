**Item #:** SCP-5308-J

**Object Class:** Euclid/Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** The items collectively known as SCP-5308-J are to be kept in 5 meter x 5 meter underground rooms with steel walls no less than one meter in thickness, with a two-inch plating of [[[scp-148 | Telekill alloy]]]. The entrance to these vaults is to be guarded at all times by at least two hundred guards from special forces backgrounds, seventeen class-D personnel blinded and given flamethrowers, three priests, two rabbis, an imam, a Sherpa, and a Girl Scout of Abrahamic faith. Four separate onsite nuclear devices are to be detonated in the event of a security breach.

**Description:** SCP-5308-J is a collection of objects of unknown anomalous properties, which have to date eluded the best minds of the Foundation. A detailed description of each item follows.

**SCP-5308-J-1:** A perfectly cubical piece of granite twenty centimeters on a side, weighing nearly 20 kilograms. It was discovered by Agent ████ at a yard sale in ████ █████, ND, and immediately recognized as dangerously Platonic. Previous owner was unfortunately killed during the ensuing firefight. Fortunately, SCP-5308-J-1 survived to be placed into Foundation custody. Please see the experiment log for details on its anomalous properties.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Experiment Log SCP-5308-J-1-13&#34; hide=&#34;- Experiment Log SCP-5308-J-1-13&#34;]]
&gt; **Professor █████:** &#34;Please approach the cube.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3534:** &#34;Uh, sure. Hey, why are you wearing that suit? Should... should I have a suit?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Professor █████:** &#34;Make a note. Subject appears agitated. Memetic or psychic effect? 3534, Please pick up the cube.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3534:** &#34;Okay. Oof. Heavy sucker.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Professor █████:** &#34;Interesting. Gravity manipulation? How do you feel, 3534?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3534:** &#34;Huh? Uh, fine, I guess.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Professor █████:** &#34;My god. It must be healing him.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3534:** &#34;What?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Professor █████:** &#34;But at what cost? Look at his confusion. It&#39;s affecting his mind. D-3534, how do you feel about the cube?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3534:** &#34;It&#39;s an okay cube, I guess.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Professor █████:** &#34;Put the cube down! Right now! Put the cube down!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; D-3534 complies.
&gt; 
&gt; **Professor █████:** &#34;Take the shot! Now! While he&#39;s no longer in contact!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; D-3534 is shot by five separate snipers simultaneously.
&gt; 
&gt; **Professor █████:** &#34;Thank god he put it down. If he&#39;d still been holding the cube when we shot him, there&#39;s no telling what it could have done. I want his remains incinerated and the ashes bound into a concrete matrix, just to be sure.&#34;[[/collapsible]]

**SCP-5308-J-2:** A piece of paper with an anomalous reddish-brown stain. Analysis shows that the stain consists of human blood. Possible connections to SCP-███, SCP-███, and SCP-███ are suspected. The stain appeared shortly after SCP-5308-J-2 seemingly attacked Dr. █████, creating a small, straight cut on the tip of his finger. It should therefore be considered extremely dangerous and hostile.

Appeasing SCP-5308-J-2 is to be considered a class Alpha-One-Aleph priority. Should it make any demands known, they are to be filled out immediately and to the letter, short of allowing SCP-5308-J-2 to escape.

**SCP-5308-J-3:** A spayed female housecat with russet fur weighing approximately 3.5 kilograms. SCP-5308-J-3 was found near the entrance to one of the Foundation&#39;s fronts. Despite multiple interrogation attempts, it has yet to reveal what it was doing there. Analysis into its anomalous properties has been fruitless as yet (see Interview Log SCP-5308-J-3-2 for details).

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Interview Log SCP-5308-J-3-2&#34; hide=&#34;- Interview Log SCP-5308-J-3-2&#34;]]
//Interview with Dr. ████████, Foundation Veterinarian.//

&gt; **Professor ██████:** &#34;So, what&#39;s it made of?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ████████:** &#34;What do you mean?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Professor ██████:** &#34;Is it made of bone?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ████████:** &#34;No. Well, its skeleton is, but not the rest of it.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Professor ██████:** &#34;Is it made of blood?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ████████:** &#34;No.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Professor ██████:** &#34;Is it made of... gravity?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ████████:** &#34;No. How would that even work?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Professor ██████:** &#34;Is it made of fire?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ████████:** &#34;No. It&#39;s just made of, well, of //cat//.&#34;

Dr. ████████ was later terminated in case of lingering mental influence by SCP 5308-J-3.[[/collapsible]]

**SCP-5308-J-4:** A standard size ball-point pen containing what appears to be human blood. It was found in a desk in an abandoned factory in ██████, Saskatchewan. The origin of this blood-like substance is unknown. Under no circumstance is anyone to attempt to write with SCP-5308-J-4. Any personnel who attempts to do so will be terminated, and their surviving relatives assigned to Keter duty.

**Addendum SCP-5308-J-4-14:** Analysis has shown that the substance contained in SCP-5308-J-4 is heavily degraded ink. Object class has been changed to Euclid.

**SCP-5308-J-5:** A three-year-old male Caucasian child who answers to the name of &#34;Jerry.&#34; It was found at a playground near Site-██, playing on a swingset. So far, it has been concluded that SCP-5308-J-5 is not bulletproof, fireproof, regenerative, stronger than average, or capable of commanding dangerous animals. Further tests are to be approved by Director ████████.

For the continued mental health of SCP-5308-J-5, a regular schedule of normal developmental activities is to be strictly enforced. Guards and researchers are to take particular note of Section 5b, &#34;Nap Time,&#34; and Section 7a, &#34;Hugs.&#34; To help combat SCP-5308-J-5&#39;s ongoing behavioral issues, use positive phrases such as &#34;How&#39;s it going, slugger?&#34; &#34;Good going, Jerry!&#34; and &#34;Your parents are probably quite proud of you, if they&#39;re still alive.&#34;
