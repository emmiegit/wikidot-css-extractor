Hey, pal, nice costume.  Yeah.  I like the way it&#39;s just your face with a couple of strings attached.  

Okay, that&#39;s far enough.  Yeah, it&#39;s a real piece, so why don&#39;t you come along quiet-like?  That&#39;s the ticket.  Just over here, an&#39; we can have a little talk.

So, the reason I&#39;m here is--stop that.  It ain&#39;t gonna work.  We had plenty of time t&#39;figure out what it was you did, an&#39; we got a fix for it.  So you can just relax.  You&#39;re collared, so you might as well find out who by.

Anyway, the reason I&#39;m here is that I&#39;m part of a group what contains objects or people what are of an unusual nature.  Yeah, like yerself.  Sucks t&#39;be you, I know.

Now, you could try t&#39;run, but this gun&#39;ll stop you before you get too far.  Won&#39;t kill ya, but you&#39;ll get a helluva headache when you wake up.  This&#39;d drop a horse, an&#39; you weigh a helluva lot less than a horse.

So, I came here t&#39;find out if the rumors were true, an&#39; there really was somethin&#39; here matchin&#39; your description.  We saw you a couple days ago, but I figured we&#39;d see you out on the town t&#39;night.

I always liked Halloween.  I could have any face I wanted.  You got a face like mine, you look forward to wearin&#39; a mask.  So I sympathize.  Only time of the year you get to come out an&#39; mingle.

Anyway, we just been waitin&#39; fer you to come out where we could nab ya.  My partner&#39;s watchin&#39; us, an&#39; pretty soon we&#39;ll go for a ride in our van to yer new home.

Ain&#39;t fair?  Yeah, I know.  I get that a lot.  An&#39; yer right, it ain&#39;t.  This were an ideal world, we could all live in peace.  Unfortunately, you an&#39; me were born in a cold bastard of a universe what doesn&#39;t give a fuck about fairness or justice.  All we got is the best we can do.

Yer ma?  I&#39;m sorry, kid.  We can&#39;t go back to see her.  I&#39;ll make sure to get someone t&#39;talk to her so she don&#39;t worry too much.  Honestly, she&#39;s probably not gonna remember a whole lot of this.  It&#39;s one of the things we do.  But we&#39;ll make sure she&#39;s okay.  You got my word.  Hell, tell you what.  We bring you in, we&#39;ll say you agreed on condition we get some cash to her, make sure she&#39;s nice an&#39; comfy for the rest of her life.  The higher-ups will buy it.  First lesson for ya.  Skips who cooperate have life a hell of a lot easier than the ones who fight back.  They&#39;ll get what they want no matter what, but you could make things easier on &#39;em.  They ain&#39;t stupid.  They&#39;ll reward good behavior.

I can&#39;t let you go, kid.  Yer in too deep.  Yeah, you say you won&#39;t hurt nobody, an&#39; I believe ya.  But we ain&#39;t the only ones out there.  There&#39;s other folks in this game.  Only they don&#39;t want to keep you contained.  They wanna kill you, or worse, turn you into a weapon.  They could make you hurt people.  I seen it done.  An&#39; they&#39;ll hurt people t&#39;get to you.  People like yer ma.  

See, there&#39;s a lot of threats out there.  Some of &#39;em are other people.  Some of &#39;em are things that would destroy the world if we let &#39;em.  I&#39;ve seen what&#39;s out there, an&#39; it ain&#39;t friendly.  Some of it&#39;s wonderful, some of it may help us, but some of it sincerely scares the shit outta me, an&#39; I don&#39;t scare easy.  There are so many things out to get us, someone&#39;s gotta be out there on humanity&#39;s side.

Nobody&#39;s on your side?  ...Yeah, but I&#39;ll tell ya what.  You have any real problems, you think your bein&#39; treated too cruel, tell yer guard to get word to Max Lombardi.  I don&#39;t got a whole lotta pull myself, but I could maybe put a word in the ear of someone who does.  Ain&#39;t gonna promise nothin&#39;.  Nobody&#39;s gonna make everythin&#39; right, y&#39;know.  We just do the best we can.</textarea></pre>
