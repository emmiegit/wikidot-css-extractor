[[span class=&#34;bigtext&#34;]]SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:[[/span]] SCP-7396 currently represents significant risk to veil protocols, though actions are being taken to limit this influence, including:

* Restrictions on deep space remote viewing technologies
* Replacement of personnel at observatories and places of academia with Foundation operatives
* Sabotage of equipment and materials belonging to groups of interest
* Execution of disinformation campaigns, utilizing the above, alongside typical methods to reduce global confidence in the Oort cloud&#39;s existence
 
Any information regarding SCP-7396 is to be scrubbed from public record, with the responsible vector investigated and delegitimized by any means necessary. Cleanup of SCP-7396 phenomena continues to take place through remote incineration. 

Development of stable, long-term containment methodologies is considered a Foundation priority.

[[span class=&#34;bigtext&#34;]]DESCRIPTION:[[/span]] SCP-7396 refers to two related phenomena, designated 7396-A and 7396-B. As a result of the timeline surrounding each, they will be described consecutively, rather than concurrently. 

SCP-7396-A is an accumulation of human biological remains and personal effects within the [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud Oort cloud], first detected on 12/03/1978 via the Nicholas U. Mayall Telescope, although indirectly; a considerable explosion witnessed from the approximate direction in which SCP-7396-A would later be discovered piqued the interest of Foundation plants within science communities worldwide. An official investigation was launched in 1980, with a small, unmanned probe deployed shortly thereafter with intent to determine the cause of the explosion and report its findings to Earth. 

During travel to the location via the [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_Transport_Network Interplanetary Transport Network], SCP-7396-A was discovered, prompting operators to recalibrate the probe&#39;s Lagrangian trajectory so as to investigate the accumulation in greater detail. Foundation analysts surmised that SCP-7396-A&#39;s condition was correlated with the observed explosion, although visual data displayed incongruency with this hypothesis, lacking sufficient supporting evidence to establish a causal link or general timeline. A subsequent lack of activity in the area deprioritized exploration in favor of SCP-7396-A&#39;s containment, which is still underway.

------

The exact quantity of remains floating in the Oort cloud is unclear, given the impacted area, although estimates based on average recorded density place the total bodies in excess of seven million individuals. Despite the sheer numbers observed, many consistencies appear throughout, which reveal further insight into SCP-7396-A&#39;s properties, such as:
 
* Calm demeanor with no signs of struggle, distress, or injury. Groups observed frozen together, in embrace and other relaxed poses
* Biological components identical to that of humans
* Pristine, freshly washed clothing, bearing matching iconography that implies SCP-7396-A is a single party or organization
* Uniform cause of death across all observations, determined to be complications associated with rapid depressurization
* A lack of escape pods, wreckage, or spacesuits
* An abundance of cargo containers, having been logged and searched, all containing personal effects such as clothing, photographs, and letters, neatly and deliberately packed. No provisions, survival tools/weapons, or medicine have been found. However, multiple instances of paper stationery analogous to postcards have been recovered, portraying a similar appearance but different geographic layout to that of Earth. Astronomical deviations in the surrounding skies have led to the conclusion that the depicted planet is not another version of Earth, but a unique body, possibly within our own universe. It should be noted, however, that no hospitable planets other than Earth exist for millions of light years in every direction.

On 01/14/2006, SCP-7396-A&#39;s accumulation rate began declining. This rate decreased steadily until 2013 when further accumulation was considered negligible enough to declare the phenomena concluded. However, the presence of SCP-7396-B, first detected on 09/02/2015 as Incident 7396, resulted in the reopening of the anomaly&#39;s case file.

SCP-7396-B refers to an ongoing discovery of biologically human corpses and mechanical wreckage, scattered in a trail of increasing density located between 0.5-1.4 ly away from the location of SCP-7396-A. Approximations made suggest cadavers exceed five million additional unique individuals, the plurality of which are situated near the far end of the observed range.

SCP-7396-B exhibits features in stark contrast with remains recovered during SCP-7396-A, including but not limited to:

* Stressed demeanor, grievous injury, and/or physical ailment, proportional to distance from SCP-7396-A
* Evidence of malnourishment and hypoxia, proportional to distance from SCP-7396-A
* Near-uniform cause of death, determined to be primarily starvation, although corpses have been observed that appear shredded via explosive force, with some lost to depressurization/exposure to deep space
* Tattered, deteriorated, or repurposed clothing throughout. Insignia/iconography matches that of SCP-7396-A. Occasional space suits have been observed
* A lack of cargo containers and packed belongings
* An abundance of mechanical fragments and other shrapnel belonging to a subluminal interstellar ark, which were recovered and contained for study

A ballistics analysis of the vessel&#39;s fuselage suggests the explosion witnessed in 1978 resulted from a large quantity of ultra-small perforations discovered coating portions of the outer shielding, near remnants of the vessel&#39;s propulsion systems and ventilation grid, the earliest pieces recovered during investigation into SCP-7396-B. Various volatile compounds and mineral fragments, found in trace amounts around the points of entry, are suspected to have caused said damage to the shielding. Despite this, the vessel was noted to have coasted for some time before its eventual disintegration into what currently remains.

No activity has since been recorded from the vicinity of SCP-7396. As of 10/12/2022, an estimated ten million bodies have yet to be destroyed.
