= Also featuring various resources!
@@@@
The Essay and Resource Hub is the centralized location for informational pages written by members of the SCP community. Unlike the **[[[Guide Hub]]]**, the following articles are not considered official advice or required reading, but may still be interesting or useful.

Unlike the “[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/guide guide]” tag, the “[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/essay essay]” or “[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/resource resource]” tags can be added by authors to their own works, which can then be added here in the appropriate section (list works in alphabetical order). Essays are intended to offer advice and opinion on specific aspects of the SCP Foundation or SCP Wiki, while Resources provide In-universe information, often as a collaboration open to new contributions. Hub pages containing useful information have also been listed below for ease of access. Message a member of the [[[http://05command.wikidot.com/maintenance-and-ancillary-staff-team-main| MAST]]] collab log pruning team if you&#39;re unsure whether your work meets the criteria to be classed as an Essay or Resource, or if you think a new subsection should be created.
