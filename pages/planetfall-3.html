The MEKHANE is just days from my grasp. Months I&#39;ve worked. I&#39;ve forcibly inserted the security engrams into the ship&#39;s main system and then sweated it out until I was sure it had forgotten about it. I&#39;ve plotted my exact route to the Confici through the parts of the mountain that are going to be shaded at the right times. I&#39;ve learned how to pilot the Tanxian Type 4 without even touching one. I&#39;m only 600,000 lines of code away from rerouting the Tanxian&#39;s power systems away from heating and interior cooling apparatus and boosting the tibiar actuators for the speed I&#39;ll require. 

The code is coming along slowly. I&#39;m backtracking and finding errors even as I write it. I can see my ribs through my shirt. I&#39;m lightheaded. I need to eat something.   

So close to not worrying about this sort of thing anymore. I don&#39;t despise my flesh, the way some of the patriarchs would have us. But I&#39;m close to outgrowing it. It&#39;ll be a relief, sure, but it did get me this far. And I still need it to do a few more things. 

I mark my place, and stand up to stretch. I reach behind and find the little divot right behind my right shoulder blade. I still wince at the memory of what it felt like, to dig that out. I run a finger into it, finding the seam running across my shoulders. I ease it, careful not to rip any blood vessels or distend any ligaments. 

With a little jerk of my neck to the side, I&#39;ve dislodged my skull. Ducking out from under the cap of flesh around it, I pass my skull through the opened seam. Now I can free the rest of myself. 

At first, the feeling of separating myself from my flesh shell felt like yanking a very deep hair out, for about half an hour. Now it&#39;s like taking off a shirt that&#39;s a little too tight. I work my arms and legs out of the rigid, hollow casing that will keep the other structure upright, and soon I&#39;m entirely free. 

The flesh shell does a neat about-face and looks at me. As it moves, I can hear the the tiny little servos implanted throughout it, located at key joints and around the vital organs. If you were to spend time with it in a quiet room, and you knew to listen, you might notice these sounds.  

Do I really look like that? So...lumpy, unkempt? It doesn&#39;t matter. I hold a hand up in front of my eyes. Gleaming, worked brass, each joint articulated carefully by myself, the fingers filigreed with fine etching. I know it&#39;s vain, but I&#39;m always amazed I could do work like this when I was in a previous form. I&#39;ll say it, I&#39;m a work of art. So much more elegant than a skeleton; functional, but not without some ornamentation. My eyes don&#39;t need to glow blue when I&#39;m like this, really. The only fleshly remnant now rests inside my skull.

I rest my hands on the flesh-shell&#39;s shoulders. I am light, my movements fine, but I am strong. Go, eat something, no conversation unless absolutely necessary, and come straight back, I tell it. The expression on my flesh-face barely shifts, acknowledging. I really hope that&#39;s not how I look when I&#39;m in there. People must think I&#39;m simple. You can only get so much out of an artificial neural unit; fusing it to the spine didn&#39;t leave a lot of room to work with. It leaves my quarters, the door closing behind it, off to grab a soy burger and take a piss while I work on the important stuff. 

I sit back down at my terminal, my metallic frame folding neatly into place, my interface much cleaner and sharper now. I take a look back at the code from the last hour; right away I spot three more mistakes that I missed earlier. Quickly, I correct the errors. The next two hundred lines come rushing to me, clear as an Earth day, and my brass fingers fly as I type.

Much better.</textarea></pre>
