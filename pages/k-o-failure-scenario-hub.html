&gt; The Executive Pugilist skimmed over the title of the young researcher&#39;s proposal and furrowed his brow.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;What the hell is an End-of-World K/O Failure Scenario?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; The researcher grinned, excited to discuss her work.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Any scenario in which the Centre is compromised in such a way that it is permanently and utterly unable to complete its mission, sir. In technical terms, the sharks win.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Isn&#39;t that a little broad?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Maybe, but do we really need a million subclassifications to tell the reader that X causes the Centre to fail in this specific way? In the end, it&#39;s always the sharks winning.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Fair enough,&#34; he shrugged. &#34;I do suppose that would get a little redundant after a while. I&#39;ll send this up to the rest of the Executive Pugilist Assembly. No promises they&#39;ll do anything with it.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Wonderful,&#34; the researcher beamed. &#34;I&#39;ve taken the liberty to include several different examples in the packet. Nothing fancy, just a couple of unique ways the scenario can go down.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; The Executive Pugilist nodded and watched the young researcher take her leave.

&#34;//I remember sitting in the Site-71 cafeteria, eating pickled cabbage and creamed corn salads with my comrades, when I finally heard someone ask aloud what we&#39;d all wondered in the dark corners of our heads.//

//What if they don&#39;t come back?//&#34;

&#34;//Only the tips of Denver&#39;s skyscrapers still protruded above the sea: glass tombstones for citizens that were washed away years ago. Within one of those lonesome monoliths, a young man in a red and black life jacket watched the surf. Despite the knowledge of what lurked within that water, he felt a sense of calm as the sunrise illuminated its surface.//&#34;

//&#34;It was like someone shit in a dead fish and left it in the hot summer sun for a few days. The flesh around his foot was all kinds of black and green and maroon. There were these sharp, tooth-like protrusions sticking out of the skin where I&#39;d put the sutures. They&#39;d chewed their way through the thread, leaving open gaps that exposed more rows of smaller, sharper teeth inside.&#34;//

&gt; Skimming over the list of examples, he furrowed his brow once more.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;What the fuck is an SCP?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; He then sighed and resumed punching his stress-shark.</textarea></pre>
