**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7300 is contained within the Site-438 pond. In events of extreme weather, an object locker with a grow light has been prepared. 

SCP-7300 currently meets with Dr. Joanna Goodman weekly, both for mental health screenings and physical inspection.

**Description:** SCP-7300 is a freshwater phytoplankton[[footnote]]//Pleurosigma, Heleoplankton//[[/footnote]]. While SCP-7300 is able to photosynthesize energy, it can also ingest organic matter. 

SCP-7300 is also capable of speech[[footnote]]Fluent in both English and Swedish[[/footnote]] at average human decibel levels and has substantial knowledge of human society.

+++ Discovery

SCP-7300 was discovered by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wilson-s-wildlife-solutions-hub Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions] during a routine blue-green algae test in the Staats Lake of Eugene, Oregon, where it was reportedly &#34;sobbing&#34; and &#34;begging for forgiveness.&#34; 

In accordance with the Boring Agreement, SCP-7300 was promptly transferred to Site-438. Following a brief observation period, an interview was conducted by Dr. Wexler.

**SCP-7300:** Hey-- ah fuck, man-- god. Uh. Thanks for moving me to a room with windows. I mean, artificial light is nice and all, but nothin&#39; quite replaces the real thing. But maybe shitty light is just my destiny, &#39;cause I&#39;m a shitty--

**Dr. Wexler:** SCP-7300. Please, stay on track. I&#39;ve bought you here to answer some questions, and hopefully we can figure out what happened to you, okay?

**SCP-7300:** That&#39;s the thing-- I think I was //always// like this. A shitty fuckin&#39; mite-- 

**Dr. Wexler:** I&#39;m going to have to ask that you remain calm. I sympathize with your situation, I really do. I got turned into a mosquito once, and lemme tell you, it wasn&#39;t very fun. But I got turned back. We can help you. 

**SCP-7300:** I-- okay. Fuck. 

**Dr. Wexler:** Thank you. To start off... what all do you remember?

**SCP-7300:** Um... a lot. My memories are kind of hazy. I remember being born, and feeling like something //very// wrong was happening. Couldn&#39;t quite place it at first-- just felt like-- like a square peg in a round hole, y&#39;know? Then I realized I was actually a guy peg in an algae hole. 

**Dr. Wexler:** Plankton hole, actually.

**SCP-7300:** A-- I&#39;m a fucking //plankton//? Like-- like Spongebob?

**Dr. Wexler:** I mean, uh... I guess you&#39;re part of the species that inspired the character? 

**SCP-7300:** Man. I should build a robot. Robot wife... Fuck yeah...

**Dr. Wexler:** Sure. So, uh, you mentioned Spongebob, do you have any other memories of human society? 

**SCP-7300:** Yeah! Tons of &#39;em. I watched //so// much cable TV. And I know how to do taxes, like, really well. I&#39;m thinking I was an accountant. I had a wife. And kids. And a kidney stone. And an ex-wife. Turns out divorce papers are harder to fill out than Form W-9s. Way, //way// harder. I don&#39;t remember their names. We lived by a river. Had to move in with my parents later. Then I must&#39;ve died. That&#39;s, uh... that&#39;s about it.

**Dr. Wexler:** That&#39;s... that&#39;s a lot. But you&#39;re saying that you were //once// a human, correct?

**SCP-7300:** I was. I think. I don&#39;t know what god I pissed off for //this// to happen. But I&#39;ve been thinking, and it&#39;s really not that bad-- it&#39;s-- I don&#39;t have to eat-- I mean, I can-- but. 

**Dr. Wexler:** But? 

**SCP-7300:** I just wanna know if this is like, a curse, or some kind of cosmic-level fuck up, or like... god. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m sorry. Shit.

**Dr. Wexler:** It&#39;s okay. You&#39;ve given me a lot of information to go off of. We can give you a happy life here, for now. There&#39;s a nice pond near here. Maybe I can see if we can put you there? 

**SCP-7300:** I... I guess? Ponds are nice. Do you have frogs there? Ducks? 

**Dr. Wexler:** Yeah! A duck recently laid eggs, we&#39;re expecting little chicks to pop up any day now. 

**SCP-7300:** Oh my god. Really?

**Dr. Wexler:** Really. 

**SCP-7300:** That&#39;s uh... That&#39;s... I don&#39;t really know what to say. But, uh, I just... I&#39;ve got one more worry. 

**Dr. Wexler:** What is it? If the pond isn&#39;t to your liking, we can try and--

**SCP-7300:** No-- no, the pond sounds great. Wonderful, even. It&#39;s just... if this //was// some kind of cosmic fuckup, where like, my guy peg got put into an algae hole... then what happened to the algae peg that got put into a guy hole?

**Dr. Wexler:** That&#39;s... we don&#39;t even know if that&#39;s what happened.

**SCP-7300:** No, no, I&#39;ve got a feeling that //is// what&#39;s happened. I&#39;m a victim here! My body is very much my concern! Because it&#39;s //mine//! 

**Dr. Wexler:** You&#39;re drawing unfounded conclusions and--

**SCP-7300:** There&#39;s some fucked up baby out there that&#39;s eating //light// and has like, zero brain function! Plankton don&#39;t //think//! I tried talking to them, to my brothers and sisters. They really don&#39;t! They get eaten up easily, they don&#39;t even think to just //swim away//! Maybe I should just embrace my position in the food chain and--

**Dr. Wexler:** Calm down. Please, just take a deep--  uh, just-- a deep... photosynthesis? Do you want to go see the pond? 

**SCP-7300:** //Do I?!?// Yeah. Fuck yeah. I fucking love ponds.

**Dr. Wexler:** Great. Ah-- just out the window, you can actually see it from here! 

**SCP-7300:** Oh //fuck//. That&#39;s a good pond. Shit, dude.

**Dr. Wexler:** It really is, huh?

**SCP-7300:** Fuck yeah! Hell yeah! Oh man. Y&#39;know what? I take it back--

**Dr. Wexler:** The pond, or--

**SCP-7300:** I love being a plankton!

As of May 1st, 2022, SCP-7300&#39;s morale ratings are at an all-time high. As such, investigations into the origins of SCP-7300 have been placed on low priority indefinitely. SCP-7300&#39;s psychologist, Dr. Goodman, expressed support for this action, stating the following:

[[div class=&#34;quote-block&#34;]]
In this case, doing anything more is unnecessary, and perhaps even harmful. SCP-7300&#39;s mental state practically crashes every single interview. Right now, it&#39;s finally doing better than ever before. 
 
The best we can do is give it a happy life, and we&#39;re doing just that currently. If you&#39;ve spoken with SCP-7300, you can tell how it feels.
 
It just really loves being a plankton. That&#39;s it.
