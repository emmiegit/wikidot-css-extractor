[[tab Overview]]
[[div style=&#34;padding: 3em&#34;]]
+++++ In a world where order and civilization are nothing but mere facades over the endless abyss of unimaginable possibilities of the Anomalous...

 It is only natural that those that have been rejected by the social order would look for answers, hope, justice, and even vengeance in that same never-ending abyss. Empowered by ancient thaumaturgy and occult science, the marginalized of the world may have a fighting chance to reclaim what the so-called &#34;normalcy&#34; has denied them for too long. Anomalous guerrillas, rogue thaumaturgic micro-states, cultic drug syndicates... Freedom fighters or criminals? For the Powers that Be, said the distinction is meaningless for all of them represent a challenge to the fragile equilibrium over which the established order rests upon. Fearful but unwilling to compromise, the rulers of the world dread the day they may not be able to suppress the fire they themselves are so guilty of fueling. But where some may fear the perfect storm, some others may see... a business opportunity.

How can political power be maintained in a reality where the anomalous exist? How to get away with keeping millions in abject poverty when magic can gift practically infinite resources? How to impose arbitrary social hierarchies on those willing to defy even the laws of nature? For how long is it even possible to control a population that can learn to master fire with their minds? To turn into beastmen? To bend reality to their will?

+++++ The answer is to fight fire with fire.

+++++ The answer is Valravn.
[[/=]]

The Valravn Corporation is an Anomalous Private Military Company, in other words, mercenaries. As a private army-for-hire at the behest of the highest bidder, it commands a highly trained force recruited from ex-operatives of the best anomalous and non-anomalous armies of this world... and others. Specialized in anomalous counter-insurgency, Valravn is active in politically unstable regions where organizations like the Foundation and GOC have less influence. At the right price, the Crows of War will lend their services to both governments and other GOIs to suppress any kind of anomalous opposition. No matter how stained and bloodied the task, Valravn will carry it with efficiency, professionalism, and secrecy.

With a vast arsenal of weaponized anomalies and state-of-the-art paratech at their disposal, Valravn&#39;s divisions are among the deadliest combat forces at the level of top Foundation MTFs and GOC elite troops. But the military power of the Corporation is supported by an equally impressive parascientific prowess: they are experts in the weaponization of anomalies, especially those that come from myth. Most of the deadliest Valravn assets find their origin in various world mythologies, reaped from their original context, and twisted into war machines to be unleashed against the unfortunate souls targeted by the Corporation. In addition, Valravn&#39;s Tyr Project is the world-leading research division on paraprosthetics and combat augmentations. Those tough or (un)fortunate enough to survive gruesome injuries are gifted not only with recovery but enhancement. Valravn&#39;s soldiers are not just equipped with the best weapons, usually, they become the weapons themselves.

Led by the mysterious High Table, the Valravn Corporation has been described both as a cult-like business and as a business-like cult. Ideologically, it professes a combination of nordic pagan determinism and capitalism worship. This is the worldview that is borne when the Viking version of the Prosperity Gospel meets the Anomalous Military Industrial Complex. Moral responsibility is an oxymoron in a universe ruled by the rigid Laws of Fate and Demand, relentlessly pushing an eternal pendulum between war and profit. This world in perpetual conflict is a fertile ground for the Corporation, always looking to expand into new ventures. For war is their business, and profiting from it is their sacred duty.

The //ethos// of the Valravn Corporation is perfectly illustrated by its two mottos. The first one, //Óðinn á yðr alla//, translates from Old Norse as &#34;Odins owns you all&#34;, an ancient Viking battle cry that reminds warriors that all lives and deaths ultimately belong to Odin and are bound to Fate, thus freeing them both from the fear of death and the guilt of killing. The second motto, &#34;We feast on the battlefield&#34;, alludes to the carrion-eater nature of corvids. As long as War keeps birthing spoils and battlefields, Valravn will thrive and reap the fruits of the killing fields.

+++++ You never lose at war when war is what you sell.

We fought like hell pushing those Chaos Insurgency bastards up into the mountains. To their credit, they made us pay for every inch advanced. But they were running out of supplies it was just a matter of time before they had to surrender. Maybe 1 or 2 weeks. But Headquarters got impatient... said they hired &#34;specialist support&#34;. Their words, not mine. Anyways those centaur things really freaked me up. There was something in the way they moved... so unnatural. The thing is they had advanced in 2 hours what it took us 4 days.

The Foundation can not comment on the presence of anomalous weaponry during last week&#39;s incident. While the cause of death is certainly anomalous in nature, attributing it to a &#34;weapon&#34; is certainly a conclusion we are still not comfortable making. The paratechnological capabilities necessary for such development, as well as the disregard for ethical considerations, would certainly be both impressive... albeit for different reasons.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Heathenry on the Battlefield, An Analysis of Valravn Corporation Faith.&#34; hide=&#34;- Close Report&#34;]]

+ Excerpts from &#34;Heathenry on the Battlefield, An Analysis of Valravn Corporation Faith&#34;, taken from the &#34;Journal of Esoteric Anthropology and Applied Mythology&#34;, PSYCHE Division Publications.

&gt; ++ Origins
&gt; 
&gt; While the modern operations of Valravn are believed to have started around 1940, the Corporation self-mythologising creed traces its origin to the semi-legendary Jomsviking mercenary order and the fall of Jomsborg. Archaeological evidence for this hypothesis is inconclusive and historical reports of various Valravn iterations existing through history are controversial among scholars.

&gt; ++ Ethics and Tenants
&gt; 
&gt; Like many heathen beliefs, The Valravn faith is heavily deterministic and amoral: “Sin” as a firm concept is a fallacy and guilt by extension needlessly hinders oneself. Where the religion differs from most heathenric movements is its view on nature and wyrd (fate). Most Heathenry movements have animistic views on the environment, believing that spirits, collectively known as &#34;wights”, or “vættir”, inhabit the world and that the land is innately spiritual and therefore sacred, deserving of honor and veneration. In opposition to this, Valravnic beliefs are mostly unconcerned with the sanctity of the land, often seeing the land as something to be exploited or taken advantage of. 
&gt; 
&gt; This is a reflex of the prevailing theme in the Valravn worldview of &#34;Vae victis&#34;, &#34;Might makes right&#34;, or &#34;fortune favors the bold&#34;: by the forces of the wyrd and power, reality is innately destined towards conflict. Conflict is inevitable, and it is the right of those who use conflict for their own benefit to do so. The Æsir, as gods of war and power, hold direct sway over wyrd and by appeasing them one can receive their favor, mostly shown physically as fortune, the main god venerated in this capacity being Othinn, chief of the Æsir. This is notably similar to the “prosperity theology” concept present in some iterations of American Protestantism, though it is thought any direct connection between the two has been deemed unlikely.

&gt; ++ Hierarchy 
&gt; 
&gt; The Valravn faith is an interesting case study of how religion and work interact in the modern day. The fact that faith is intertwined with the function of the Corporation has major effects on the religion, its core beliefs, and its adherents. The Corporation functions as both church and employer - the work is holy and sacred, and betrayal is betraying the Gods and well as the organization. The peer pressure and work environment are highly effective in converting and indoctrinating new employees. 

&gt; ++ Denomination
&gt; 
&gt; Likely due to the international scope of its parent organization, variations on orthodox belief have developed. Syncretism and absorption of local folklore is very common within these sects, often combining the myths and gods of the region with Heathenric deities. Notable among these include the beliefs of “Cuervos de Los Muertos”, a Valkyrie team likely based somewhere in the Yucatán Peninsula, who venerate Mayan deities syncretized with Norse figures (primarily Kukulkan, the Mayan iteration of the feathered serpent deity, combined with the figure of Jǫrmungandr), alongside the use of traditional magic systems. These practices of this and other similar cults are nigh-heretical to some practitioners, but the Corporation as a whole does not seem to prejudice against those with &#34;deviant&#34; beliefs.

[[tab FAQ]]
[[div style=&#34;padding: 3em&#34;]]

**So what was all that about?**
The Valravn Corporation (A.K.A GOI-1043) is a mercenary GOI that specializes in anomalous counter-insurgency. They are principally active in politically unstable regions where the presence of organizations like the Foundation and the GOC is less prominent. They are mostly hired by governments to suppress anomalous rebel groups and protect their interest against otherworldly threats. In a world where the Veil is thinning and the anomalous is finding its way into the hands of those forgotten by hegemonic rule, the business of protecting the rich and privileged from the consequences of their indifference is more lucrative than ever.

**So are Valravn the bad guys?**
In most cases yes. Valravn is a ruthless mercenary corporation that does the dirty job for corrupt governments and shady organizations. So they are pretty much evil. However, it is good to keep in mind that they are not evil for evil sake. They are brutal and ruthless in their operations, but always in service of achieving their mission. Atrocities are just part of their business and a successful business is always their priority. Also, the brutality of their methods is influenced by the nature of the mission and the desires of their client. If hired by a somewhat more benevolent entity, they will comply if commanded to show more restraint and even mercy... for an elevated tariff of course.

**What is the Foundation&#39;s role in all of this?**
The recommended setting for Valravn&#39;s stories is one where the Veil is weakening and people are rediscovering the Anomalous and using it to fight back against oppression. In this context, Valravn is mainly the response of global imperial capitalism to maintain its hegemony in the face of anomalously powered resistance. This situation forces the Foundation to tolerate Valravn as part of the ecosystem that maintains the Veil. This raises the question of whether the &#34;normalcy&#34; that the Foundation upholds was worth protecting in the first place. &#34;Consensus reality&#34; seemed to have been specially defined to benefit certain groups above others. Even the term itself is misleading, who is actually &#34;consenting&#34; to it? Suppressing the anomalous has always been done in the name of the &#34;greater good&#34;? But who is this &#34;greater good&#34; really for? These are the type of questions that are worth exploring in this setting.

However, same as with everything else in the SCPverse, every author and reader is free to choose their canon. Alternative takes on these dynamics are welcomed.

**Is there a more concrete example of why the Foundation tolerates Valravn?**
For example, in the &#34;El Cuervo y las Víboras&#34; series, the Foundation and GOC had signed an accord with Valravn: The Cartagena Agreement. The Corporation is allowed to conduct its business as long as they respect the Veil and only deploys its anomalous assets against anomalous targets. In this canon, Valravn is tolerated mainly for two reasons: First, while certainly the Foundation and GOC could ultimately defeat Valravn, this war will prove too costly for them. Second, Valravn takes care of many anomalous groups in countries where the Foundation has difficulty operating, groups that otherwise will be the Foundation&#39;s problem and threat to the Veil. Whether or not this deal was worth remains in the air.

**What is the difference between Valravn and MC&amp;D?**
They are similar in the sense that both are morally questionable shady organizations led by a group of mysterious individuals who profit from anomalies. The difference is that MC&amp;D get their profit by trading and trafficking anomalies, while Valravn uses anomalies as weapons instead; Valravn&#39;s revenue comes from selling their services as an anomalous mercenary army. It could be said that MC&amp;D and Valravn share a customer base of the global elite but offer different services.

**How sincere is Valravn&#39;s devotion to the Norse Gods?**
Are the leaders of Valravn religious fanatics who worship war as a sacred duty from the gods? Or are they just hyper-capilistic plutocrats who appropriated Norse determinism and warrior culture to justify their business and indoctrinate their recruits? What about the employees? Some may be true believers. Others could just be cynical mercenaries. Maybe the question should be, does it make a difference?

**How does Valravn recruit people?**
Valravn&#39;s leadership tends to prey on the physically or psychologically vulnerable as well as the economically desperate to secure recruits they can control. They usually go after disabled or impoverished combat veterans that would be more willing to sing with the Corporation and all that it implies. They could even include civilians in their recruitment pool if the situation requires it. Though rarely outright forcing people to join them, the &#34;consent&#34; of many of their recruits is questionable at best. However, there are always warmongers that will join the Corporation not only willingly but enthusiastically. Valravn is always welcoming of those blood-thirsty and power-hungry enough to embrace the Corporation&#39;s &#34;gifts&#34; and join the anomalous warfare industry.

**Do all Valravn&#39;s anomalies have to be Norse mythology related?**
No. Valravn has a preference for weaponizing mythological anomalies or at least to get inspiration for its paratech projects from mythology. Some of their anomalies may be from Norse mythology, while others are taken from myths from all over the world. In the end, the Valravn Corporation is very practical. They will take and use whatever anomaly better suits their goals. The mythological angle is more of a thematic suggestion for the writer rather than a Valravn rule. Any anomaly, mythological or otherwise, will be employed by the Corporation if it offers an advantage. Feel free to get creative.

**What the hell is a valravn anyways?**
A valravn[[footnote]] Danish &#34;raven of the slain&#34;[[/footnote]] is a supernatural raven from Danish folklore. They are ravens that after consuming the flesh of those dead on the battlefield, gained human knowledge and the ability to turn into warriors. So the name fits an organization whose main activity is profiting and feeding from the spoils of war.

**Are there actual valravns working at Valravn?**
Probably.

Valkyrie Head Quarters (VHQ) coordinates the operation of all Valkyrie squads. The leader of Valkyrie HQ bears the title of Dróttning.

**Chirons**
In a normal army, losing leg mobility would mark the end of a military career. For Valravn, it is just a necessary rite-of-passage into the next generation of rough terrain mobility. With its all-terrain quadruped paraprosthetics, the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-chiron-model |Chiron Model]]] can ambush the enemy where they least expect it and disengage before they have a chance to respond.

An offshoot of the Serpent&#39;s Hand, Las Víboras is a left-wing anomalous guerrilla organization active in Latinamerica. They use thaumaturgy and other anomalous tactics to fight government oppression across the continent. This often put them at odds with Valravn, the world&#39;s main supplier of anomalous counter-insurgency services.

**Sin Nombre Drug Cartel**
A ruthless and blood-thirsty drug syndicate, they control the trade of the anomalous drug Arcángel. Commanding a powerful army of Nahual sicarios, even the Mexican government and Foundation beware the wrath of the Men With No Name. Las Víboras is one of the few groups brave or foolish enough to stand against Sin Nombre. This creates a complicated dynamic when Valravn enters the picture.

Keep in mind that Valravn is basically a tool for neocolonial capitalism to maintain its grip over the third world. In a reality where magic and the Anomalous exist, the suppression of this knowledge is an integral part of disempowering people and makes them vulnerable to oppression. After all, a lot of historical colonialism was justified as a crusade to bring &#34;Enlightenment&#34; to the superstitious, but if the so-called &#34;superstitious beliefs&#34; were actually closer to reality, then there must be something else going on. This is an opportunity to deconstruct and question the roles of institutions like the Foundation and the GOC who act as the &#34;good cops&#34;, suppressing the anomalous for &#34;the good of the people&#34; while protecting a status quo where injustice and imperialism are unquestioned components of &#34;normalcy&#34;. In other words, they basically gaslight the entire world into accepting a &#34;consensus reality&#34; that benefits the few to detriment of the many. Valravn, on the other hand, acts as the &#34;bad cop&#34;, stepping to suppress anomalous rebellions when The Powers That Be requires more brutal methods to impose neoliberal policies and capitalism realism.

Valravn has a preference for using or at least being inspired by mythical anomalies for their weapons programs[[footnote]]However, this is a thematic suggestion rather than a rule. Valravn anomalies don&#39;t have to be necessarily related to mythology. Feel free to get creative.[[/footnote]], so a good starting point for an idea could be asking how can an ancient weapon or creature be adapted for modern combat. Or maybe the anomaly itself was originally peaceful or at least non-combat oriented,  how did the Corporation manage to twist it into a weapon? Or more interestingly, how can an anomaly serve Valravn operations even if it is not directly military?

A thing to have in mind when writing about Valravn is that for the Corporation their soldiers and employees, anomalous or otherwise, are mostly resources to be utilized in the pursuit of their goals. They have little to no consideration for them as persons. Valravn &#34;augmentations&#34; will almost always lean into the body-horror side of things. Valravn will prey on the physically or psychologically vulnerable to secure recruits they can control. However,  the fact that Valravn dehumanizes its personel does not mean they will waste them. Valravn does not have a big army, instead, they have a very specialized and expensive one. So they will try to deploy their limited resources in an efficient manner. This is reflected in their tactics, for example, they will go for a &#34;surgical strike&#34; instead of relying on &#34;human wave&#34; tactics.

If you are writing an SCP article about a Valravn anomaly there are a few starting plot points to consider. For example, did Valravn surrender the anomaly to the Foundation willingly? What would motivate them to do that? It could be that the anomaly was too difficult to control or was not practical for their goals. Maybe the Foundation had to fight for it, either militarily or politically? Maybe there is technically a truce between them, but their relationship is tense and peace is fragile. Or maybe there is direct hostility and total war is on the table. How was the anomaly used by Valravn? What was the context of the conflict? What were the implications of an anomaly being involved in a war, both for the factions in conflict and for the anomaly itself?

Do Valravn stories have to be political? Not necessarily, it is perfectly possible and valid to focus on the paratech and sci-fi side of the GOI and write an article that is not directly related to politics. On the other hand, due to its subject matter, political implications are hard to avoid when writing this GOI. While Valravn can fit the role of a generic evil army just fine, the GOI lends itself as an avenue to explore and comment on political topics, for example, arms races and the privatization of war. Keep in mind, that engaging with this kind of topic requires an extra effort to be responsible and respectful.

Is Valravn always a villain? They are originally meant to be, however, there are situations where strange times create strange bedfellows. Also, while the Corporation as a whole may be villainous, its individual employees may not be irredeemable. Feel free to try different takes. Something to keep in mind is that the intentions and ethics of whoever is employing them are going to impact the role they play in a story. It is not hard to find threats in the vast multiverse that can make even Valravn seem like the lesser evil.

[[tab GOI Format]]
[[div style=&#34;padding: 3em&#34;]]
Valravn GOI formats come usually in two flavors. One is after-action reports, describing and detailing a recent mission undergone by a military team. Normally an after-action report includes the following parts, but the structure can be flexible:

* Summary (optional): A brief description of what the report is going to be about.
* Background: What was the context where the mission took place? Who were the participants in the conflict? What were their goals? Who is the employer? Who is the enemy? What were their equipment and tactics? What was the objective of the mission? Everything that is necessary to understand why the operation took place.
* Incident Overview: How did the mission go? How did Valravn troops approach the situation? What tactics and strategies were employed? Which assets were deployed? What was the expected outcome? How did it resolve? The goal is to communicate to the reader a clear understanding of what happened during the mission.
* Aftermath: What were the consequences of the mission? Was the objective accomplished? How is this going to impact the region where it took place? How is Valravn benefiting from it?
* Conclusion (Optional): If the mission was successful or failed, elaborate on why. What new information was obtained? Were the Corporation&#39;s goals achieved? How will this impact Valravn&#39;s future strategies?

After-action reports are written from the perspective of military commanders reporting to their superiors. Neutral third-person language is preferred over the first-person. The language used is technical, concise, and detached, similar to Foundation&#39;s clinical tone but with an emphasis on the tactical side of things instead of a scientific one.

The second type of format is internal technical briefings on anomaly weaponization projects[[footnote]]Or any other type of project that could be relevant to the Corporation.[[/footnote]]. These describe the technical and tactical aspects of new Valrvan assets under development:

* Summary (optional): A brief description of what the report is going to be about.
* Background: Everything is necessary to understand the anomaly. What does Valravn know about it? Its origin, properties, behavior, and what makes it a good candidate for military application.
* Technical Description: How is the anomaly going to be weaponized? What change does it need to undergo in order to become a military asset? Can this be mass produced? What are the challenges that may arise?
* Tactical and Strategical Justification: How is this going to benefit Valravn&#39;s operations on both a tactical and a strategic level? What advantage is Valravn getting from this project? What would be the role of the asset on the battlefield?

As with the after-action report, the technical brief structure is flexible and can be modified to suit the particular necessities of an article. Technical briefs are written by the perspective of Valravn researcher presenting a new development to their superior, so the langue is technical and clinical, more &#34;scientific&#34; than the after-action report and more in line with the tone of a Foundation file.

As with Foundation articles, both after-actions reports and technical briefs can be complemented with video and audio logs, interviews, images, chat logs, mail exchanges, and any other supplement that may benefit the narrative.

Valravn articles usually start with a notice from the High Table. It is not necessary to include it but may help to set the tone. This comes imported with Valravn&#39;s theme. The &#34;papernote&#34; component included in the theme can also be used for formatting article sections beyond the High Table notice.
