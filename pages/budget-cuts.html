It was a gloomy day at Site-19.

“They just cut our funding again,” Dr. Bergstrom said, speaking around a mouthful of Salisbury steak. “I’m down to two assistants.”

“I hear you, man,” Agent Rourke said with a sigh. “My team’s getting evaluated by Director Daniels tomorrow. I just //know// he’s gonna disband us. I’ll probably end up working a fucking //desk job//.”

Dr. Wynne, carrying a tray of food, came over and sat down at their cafeteria table.

“This //fucking// place,” she spat. “They just told us they’re gonna be transferring half the staff in our department to other Sites. Said they’re trying to ‘trim the fat’. I swear, I&#39;m in the wrong business. I bet GOC scientists don&#39;t have to put up with this kind of shit.&#34;

Dr. Bergstrom shook his head. “Yeah, working for the Foundation really isn’t what it used to be. Did I tell you they even took away our entire D-class allowance? We’re having to test anomalies on //animals// now!”

“Same here,” Agent Rourke said. “We used to get ‘em for use in high-risk explorations, but then they just stopped sending them over.”

Dr. Wynne nodded. “Us too. Apparently it&#39;s like that everywhere, not just Site-19. They&#39;re saying we’re gonna have to make do without D-class from now on.”

“Huh,” Dr. Bergstrom said, frowning. “I wonder what //that’s// about.”

“Who knows?” Agent Rourke said with a shrug.

For a while the three of them ate in silence.

&#34;Well, at least meat&#39;s back on the menu,&#34; Dr. Bergstrom said at last.
