**Item #:** SCP-2781

**Object Class:** Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to SCP-2781&#39;s widespread habitat, conventional containment is currently not possible. Mobile Task Force Zeta-66 (&#34;Triangular Dragon&#34;) is assigned to verify all sightings of SCP-2781. Civilians who have encountered SCP-2781 instances are to undergo amnestic treatment. All civilian vessels are to be diverted from all identified habitats of SCP-2781. 

**Update (01/08/1983):** Personnel are not to have direct contact with SCP-2781 instances or be underwater in presence of SCP-2781 instances. 

##blue|SCP-2781-969 is contained in a Type XL humanoid containment cell at Site-2781.##

**Description:** SCP-2781 is a --species of black marine entities of unverified taxonomy-- ##blue|collective designation for 969 entities self-referred as &#39;bodhisattva [[footnote]] ##blue|Refers to beings in Mahayana Buddhism who have reached enlightenment but vows to save all other entities in suffering before becoming a buddha.## [[/footnote]] of the high seas&#39;##, with an estimated body length of five metres and two bulbous eyes. ##blue|These entities also possess reality bending capabilities, although usage is rare for the Buddha cautioned against vain use of miracles. See **Addendum 2781-2** for one known usage of reality bending capabilities.## SCP-2781 instances consistently reside on the epipelagic layer of the sea. 

SCP-2781 --is speculated to be carnivorous,-- exclusively --targeting-- ##blue|targets## live humans whose bodies are partially or fully submerged in water (hereon referred to as --prey-- ##blue|&#39;target&#39;##). Conversely, SCP-2781 uniformly avoids non-human animals, deceased humans and live humans not submerged in water. ##blue|This is attributed to the Buddhist belief that humans are most likely to receive dharma effectively.## --Feeding is highly irregular; SCP-2781 instances can spend long durations (up to approximately 55 years) without consuming prey.-- ##blue|SCP-2781 does not require any sustenance to maintain itself.##

SCP-2781 has an indeterminable number of tentacles of varying lengths and widths, usually folded into its body and can be unfolded for the purpose of capturing --prey-- ##blue|targets##. When at least one tentacle is in direct contact with the --prey-- ##blue|target## or their clothes, additional tentacles will envelop the --prey-- ##blue|target## entirely. Envelopment will last for approximately two seconds, after which constriction ends and the --prey-- ##blue|target## disappears. Usage of thermal imaging devices indicates that the --prey-- ##blue|target## spontaneously disappears immediately after complete envelopment, whereas embedded GPS devices lose signal after the --prey&#39;s-- ##blue|target&#39;s## disappearance. 

##blue|The target is thus transported to a dimension tentatively classified as SCP-2781-A. Based on first-person observation, SCP-2781-A is hypothesised to be a &#34;pure land&#34;. [[footnote]] ##blue|Refers to a celestial realm of a buddha or bodhisattva as ascribed in Mahayana Buddhism.## [[/footnote]] To date, SCP-2781 is the only known means to access SCP-2781-A. Targets inside SCP-2781-A will gradually gain claircognizance regarding dharma teachings; SCP-2781-A or an entity which created SCP-2781-A are speculated to be possible sources. This is done with the intent of allowing targets attain Nirvana. After which, they may ascend to Buddhahood or willingly reject Buddhahood to become a bodhisattva. The former cannot be ascertained, whereas in the latter&#39;s case, targets will manifest in the world as an instance of SCP-2781.##

SCP-2781&#39;s existence has been known to the Foundation precursor &#39;Bureau of Onmyō&#39; since the Edo period (1603 -- 1868 CE), whereby instances were sighted in water bodies surrounding Japan. In those sources, they were termed as &#39;umibōzu&#39; (&#34;sea bonze&#34;) due to the head&#39;s superficial resemblance to that of the Buddhist monk a.k.a. bonze. ##blue|The similarities between SCP-2781&#39;s self-designation and the popular term &#39;umibōzu&#39; are notable and can be used as an axiom for further research on SCP-2781.##

Foundation research efforts regarding SCP-2781 began shortly after the organisation&#39;s formation. Since then, additional instances have been identified across the East China Sea and Pacific Ocean. Areas with the highest SCP-2781 population density include the Kanmon Straits, with the earliest known sightings recorded during the Kamakura period (1185 -- 1333 CE). 

To date, --no SCP-2781 instance (live or deceased) has been placed under Foundation captivity. Additionally,-- the known SCP-2781 population is in excess of 900. --Method of reproduction or manifestation are currently unknown.-- ##blue|SCP-2781 does not reproduce. Manifestation is a voluntary process (See paragraph 4 of **Description**).##

**Addendum 2781-1:** Following Agent Trip Kata&#39;s --death-- ##blue|entry into SCP-2781-A## on 03/07/1983 whilst investigating SCP-2781-753 in the Kii Channel, **Special Containment Procedures** have been modified for safety reasons; see **Update (01/08/1983)**.  

**Addendum 2781-2:** On 13/05/2014, all known SCP-2781 instances (up to SCP-2781-968) vanished simultaneously for ten minutes before re-manifesting in their previous positions. The process continued for five hours until the affected instances re-manifest at their previous positions and have become intangible --via unknown means--.  

##blue|Additionally, Site-2781 spontaneously manifested in the Kii Channel. It contains 969 Type XL humanoid containment cells. Currently, one SCP-2781 instance is contained in Site-2781 (SCP-2781-969) while translucent apparitions of the other SCP-2781 instances are held in their respective cells. Due to their intangibility, it is unknown if contact with those SCP-2781 instances can send targets to SCP-2781-A.##

##blue|--They-- We are contained. --Our-- The Foundation&#39;s suffering lessens. Contain. The Middle Way. Amitābha.##
