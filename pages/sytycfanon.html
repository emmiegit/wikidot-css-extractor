**Home of the Set of Nine and the Chugwater Chronicles**

Hello, fellow wiki users! My name is Sergio of the So You Think You Can Fanon podcast. I&#39;m a 23-year-old Grad student currently studying biology. My primary focus as an author is.... all over the place! I tend to write whatever comes to my heart but primarily I focus on comedy articles and humanoids with a dash of seriousness when it calls for it.

Whether I contribute by interviewing SCP personalities and authors on our show or reading SCPs, and also writing them; I&#39;m glad to be a part of the community.

Check out my podcast and other links here: https://linktr.ee/sytycfanon 

If you are interested in more works in my world, please visit [[[The-Ninth-World-Hub]]] to see the full list of stories people have made with my concepts and characters.

 If you would like to write for the Ninth World, please just shoot me a Wikidot PM. I&#39;d love to collaborate on any ideas you may have. Please do not PM me asking to explain downvotes.

**[[[SCP-6419]]] -- Izanami&#39;s Grimoire**
[[module ListPages name=&#34;SCP-6419&#34;]]
**[##green|+%%rating%%##]** (##grey|%%comments%% comments##)
[[/module]]
&gt; Story Description: Part 1 of the Set of Nine. Izanami&#39;s Grimoire is an anomalous book that manipulates reality to kill those who touch it or view its pages. The Chaos Insurgency and the Foundation soon find themselves under its nefarious control.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Author&#39;s Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
 So this is my first successful article although it&#39;s technically the second that I wrote. The idea originally came about from wanting to make an SCP using the Pataphysics theme (Cause I liked the spinny logo plus the subtitle). A friend of mine Matt came up with the idea of an alternate Death note which formed the basis of Izanami&#39;s Grimoire. He also suggested adding the detail that it was a numbered volume which would form the basis of what I would call the Set of Nine.

This article went through several revisions while drafting and even an eventual rewrite. The main hang-up was that it wasn&#39;t believable that the Foundation would continue testing despite the inherent danger to the anomaly. It wasn&#39;t until a user suggested that the Grimoire had been manipulating events that I finally had a version people would enjoy. 

The rewrite changed a number of things. Other works had added details about the CI attack on Site-78 so these were incorporated (Johnston leading troops to clear CI forces). Todd Jackson was reshaped into a more sympathetic character and the story was designed to be more tragic as a result. Chudley and Johnston were given much bigger roles to get readers introduced to the main characters of the series, with Johnston being added in entirely.

Overall, I&#39;m quite happy with this one and it&#39;s very nostalgic for me.

**[[[SCP-6952]]] -- Hephaestus&#39;s Anomalous Weapons Manual**
[[module ListPages name=&#34;SCP-6952&#34;]]
**[##green|+%%rating%%##]** (##grey|%%comments%% comments##)
[[/module]]
&gt; Part 2 of the Set of Nine. The Valravn Corporation offers the Foundation a manual that can create any weapon its user desires in exchange for knowledge of SCP-6755. Clearly, there is more to this mystery than meets the eye...

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Author&#39;s Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
Author Commentary: There&#39;s a lot I can say about this article but honestly I don&#39;t want to get into the drama the preceded the version that&#39;s on the site now so we&#39;ll just talk about the article in its current state.

After writing 6419, I began to brainstorm Ideas for what the next book would be. I knew from the get-go that i wanted one of the books to be a Thaumiel and settled on a book that could be used to make weapons and that would be the crux of the creation of a new MTF that would serve as Site-78&#39;s primary fighting force. This would be the Street Samurai, named after the Shadowrun archetype.

But I needed a new Researcher Character to drive this article. Our previously introduced protagonist, Chudley was not going to fit this article. So I decided to go with a woman to be the yin to Chudley&#39;s yang. Her name would be Maria Johnston and her deal was she was a Biologist with a limited ability in engineering that was thrust onto this project due to her quick thinking skills. I&#39;d envisioned her as someone who always wanted to be a classical hero and jumping at the bit to lead men into the field but also someone who felt as is if they didn&#39;t deserve such a responsibility.

Next, I needed another GOI to tie the book to, and at the time, Kilerpoyo was developing the Valravn hub. Immediately I was drawn in by its cyberpunk aesthetics and its underworld mercenary vibes, especially the concept of their all-female fighting force that I saw as akin to the Sisters of Battle from WH40k. All this mind, I thought they were the perfect fit for this sort of article and I began to base the plot off of them.

I wanted this article to be a lore guide that would be used to form the backbone of Site-78&#39;s technology and the primer for the relationship between the Foundation and Valravn, showing their truce as uneasy. In addition to showing the High Table and their scheming corporate faces, I also wanted to introduce some key characters in the form of Valkyries.

This lead to the development of the Valkyrie squad that was known as the Hospitallers which were denoted by a letter and a number for their codenames. Sigrun, Gondul, Brynhilde, and Herja. Their characterizations started out fairly simple. Gondul was the techie, Brynhilde the leader, Sigrun the brash, and Herja was the mentor/caring mother figure to Sigrun but who would these Valkyries fight?

Well, I needed a group that was objectively worse than Valravn in order to make these Anti-heroes, seem a bit more sympathetic. Enter the Volk Division, a group of anomalous mercenaries who killed SIgrun&#39;s family. There was never meant to be much depth to them, merely cannon fodder to be dispatched.

However, if you read the article now, you&#39;ll notice that Herja and Gondul are nowhere to be found and we encounter two other characters instead, Thalaestris and her commander. Well in the midst of the rewrites, I had begun developing the idea of Valravn being comprised of multiple branches, one of these being Greek. So I pivoted the story away from the Hospitallers, now known as the Sveromeyja to focus on Thalaestris and how Valravn treats the women under its command as commodities and tools to be sold. Thus giving us our first named member of the Street Samurai as she is recruited into the unit at the end.

To conclude my thoughts, despite all the negative backlash: I really do enjoy this article. I had fun crafting all the weapon descriptions and it&#39;s ultimately become one of the pillars that most of my works draw from. Story wise however, I&#39;d still put 6419 above this one.
