++ Verse I




At the flower festival, I saw her from afar
Sitting on a bench with her seven string guitar
Her dress was like a rainbow, her smile like the sun
I was thinking to myself &#34;Well maybe&#39;s she&#39;s the one&#34;

As I was walking over, I looked into her eyes
They were red and cloudy, just like the Martian skies
And then she called me over, and said to sing along
We made music for hours and I learned to play this song

++ Chorus

She says everybody has a story to be told
And she swears they&#39;d love me back on her homeworld
She says everybody will someday find their place
So take my hand and love me, let&#39;s run to outer space

++ Verse II

I walked aboard her starship, we&#39;re kissing in the dark 
I feel her arms around me, when we finally embark
I run my fingers through her hair as we&#39;re sailing past Orion
Humming little tunes in bed, as the stars go flying

We stop inside a nebula, and play in it like snow
She asks if there&#39;s any place that I would like to go
I tell her I&#39;d go anywhere, with her hand in mine
She said she knew a place where the moons always shine

++ Chorus

She says everybody has a story to be told
And she swears they&#39;d love me back on her homeworld
She says everybody will someday find their place
So take my hand and love me, let&#39;s run to outer space

++ Verse III

When we&#39;re standing in the moonlight, I finally see her clear
A dozen eyes and violet skin, she&#39;s frowning ear to ear
Her tendrils pointing down she says she&#39;s sorry that she lied
But I told her that she&#39;s beautiful, we both just hugged and cried

++ Chorus II

I said everybody has a story to be told
And I&#39;ll make sure she&#39;ll always have a hand to hold
I told her in my heart that she&#39;d always have a place
So take my hand and love me, don&#39;t ever hide your face
