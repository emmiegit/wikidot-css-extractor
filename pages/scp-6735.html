**__Special Containment Procedures:__** Location of anomaly unknown. All encounters between Foundation assets and SCP-6735 to date have inflicted unacceptable casualties. Direct confrontations suspended indefinitely. Containment efforts currently prioritize mitigation of effects on civilian personnel and establishment of tranquilizing agent for future confinement of anomaly. HAZ/III protocols applicable in all cases of potential exposure. MTF-G-21 dispatched to Zones 02-1, 03-1, 03-4, and 06-9 in pursuit of SCP-6735. 

All affected personnel, Foundation assets or otherwise, are to be terminated on sight. Bodies must be incinerated. Operatives instructed to continuously inspect their own flesh and flesh of others in search of aberrant protrusions. Such protrusions are confirmation of SCP-6735 exposure. Procedure described above must be enacted immediately. Failure to comply is tantamount to complicity. Security personnel authorized to take any and all actions deemed necessary to ensure minimal spread of effects.

**__Description:__** Tall, corpulent, bipedal entity with general physiology corresponding to that of baseline humans. Facial features described as &#34;excessive.&#34; Anomaly noted as possessing eyes, ears, noses, etc. far in excess of standard number in baseline humans. Distribution of muscle and fat suggests morbid obesity. Entity possesses various horn-like protrusions along its epidermis seemingly comprised of bone or chitin. When idle, entity is observed lightly grabbing protrusions intermittently. Anomaly possesses a facial expression consistently described as friendly, welcoming, or warm. 

Close physical proximity to SCP-6735 induces immediate and drastic physical changes. Skeletal system of affected subjects is irreversibly compromised. Bones fuse at seemingly random points, rendering subject immobile and inflicting exceptionally severe pain. Protrusions similar to those found on SCP-6735 will begin to emerge from various tissues. Maximum recorded length of protrusions is 2.8m. Changes are incapacitating but not fatal. Anomaly will seek out subjects experiencing these effects and dislodge protrusions from their bodies via high force. Protrusions are then grafted to SCP-6735 through unknown means. Entity will run hands along bodies of affected subjects slowly in an apparent attempt to &#34;sate&#34; them (see behavioral notes below). 

Protrusions attached to SCP-6735 vibrate or otherwise &#34;twitch&#34; sporadically. Audio analysis has yielded human vocalizations corresponding to known victims of the anomaly. Anomaly has been observed gently caressing protrusions until vocalizations/movement ceases. Such contact is the only apparent method of stopping movement of protrusions. Human vocalizations cease entirely when this occurs. Uncommonly, protrusions will produce red substance presumed to be blood. Further investigation of protrusions ongoing. Low-range cooing and infantile noises can be heard in vicinity of anomaly when it is not pursuing prey subjects.

**__Discovery:__** Entity discovered wandering streets of ██████, Thailand, terminating three to four adolescents before moving to low-activity area of the city. Upon identification by field team, entity was observed caressing protrusions and humming what was presumed to be a soft, relaxing &#34;lullaby&#34; (Reference Document: 6735-01-AR). Containment attempt aborted after loss of initial recovery team.

+++ ##black|{{ADDENDUM: SCP-6735 PROTRUSION ANALYSIS, ATTEMPT 09}}##
##black|{{**ATTENDING**: Dr. Jeremy Pogan, Clearance Level 4, Organic Threat Analysis Department}}##
##black|{{**PURPOSE**: Analysis of bioelectrical signals produced by SCP-6735 protrusions.}}##
-----
##black|{{**NOTES**: Portion of protrusion collected by field team. All team operatives save for Agent ████ terminated. Sample (ID: #673501) connected to EKG. Initial analysis yields measurable activity. Sample #673501 placed in water-saline solution. No change. Sample #673501 connected to YUR-2 cognitive projection device[[footnote]]Produces digital recreations of measurable thought patterns using 3D rendering.[[/footnote]]. Procedure initializes. Resulting renders collected. Descriptions follow.##}}

##black|{{**RENDER 673051-A:** Render depicts concrete structure. Base of structure is lined with tile floor, possibly marble. Unidentified liquid present on floor. Structure possesses a single entrance with no visible windows. Light produced by unknown means. Paintings along walls of structure depict subjects experiencing positive emotions, mostly elation and ecstasy. Visibility minimal due to unknown yellowish gas present in each area. Laughing is audible in the distance.##}}

{{##black|Central hallway leads to two flanking rooms and main gathering space. Door to left room is locked. Render fails to show interior of room. Door to right room opens without issue. Contents of room are various candies and dessert items. All items are well preserved. Wrappers are present along the wall, suggesting prior consumption. Stuffed animals line the base of the floor near doorway. All show slight damage. Stuffing is exposed and spilling from a small elephant toy. Laughing intensifies. Yellowish gas begins to dissipate. Door to central space is slightly ajar.##}} 

{{##black|Central room is occupied by approximately twenty (20) human subjects. All subjects are prepubescent children or adolescents. SCP-6735 stands in the center of the group. Subjects are initially motionless. SCP-6735 begins cooing. Subjects begin to gently sway in time with coos. Candies, stuffed animals, and other childish items descend vertically from unknown source. Several items are collected by younger subjects. SCP-6735 hums a song. A girl (approximately age 9-12) begins crying. Utterances are conflicting (distress followed by relief). Anomaly approaches subject and comforts her through physical touch. There is an initial struggle. Subject eventually remains still. Rate at which items appear in the room greatly quickens.##}}

{{##black|SCP-6735 turns attention in the direction of render camera. Expression shifts to disgust. Subjects similarly turn attention to render camera. Appearance of items ceases. Quantity of gas present greatly increases. SCP-6735 begins humming, albeit more loudly. Subjects surrounding anomaly begin to convulse and writhe. Sobbing becomes nearly deafening. Reddish-black substance begins to seep forth from orifices of subjects. Humming increases in volume. Render camera disabled through unknown means. Analysis of render concludes. Attempts to recreate render fail.##}}

##black|{{Subsequent sightings of SCP-6735 note disposal of all previous protrusions.}}##

##black|{{All further render logs classified.}}##
