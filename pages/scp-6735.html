**Item #:** SCP-6735

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6735 is presently contained in Unit #194 at Site-14&#39;s Anomalous Wildlife Wing. Subject is to be fed three times daily, and its containment cell should be cleared of ash twice weekly. Usage of SCP-6735 for testing purposes requires prior consent from Director Magnus.

**Description:** SCP-6735 is a mature male dog //(Canis lupus familiaris)// of indeterminate breed, first obtained in 1839 by Her Majesty&#39;s Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal [[[SCP-6087 | (HMFSCP)]]]. 

SCP-6735 is believed to be biologically immortal, and has not been observed to age or become sick at any point throughout its two centuries in containment. Notably, SCP-6735 walks with a slight limp likely the result of blunt force trauma, suggesting that it does not hold any regenerative capabilities. 

SCP-6735 possesses highly luminous eyes of red colouration, and displays an internal body temperature of approximately 55 °C (131 °F). Additionally, the subject&#39;s footprints have been found to contain small quantities of carbon ash, although no source for this has been determined.

SCP-6735 has demonstrated the following anomalous qualities:

* Enhanced vision. Testing has shown that SCP-6735 is capable of easily discerning objects and barriers even in pitch-black environments.

* Limited telekinesis. SCP-6735 is capable of unsealing locked doors, safes and storage cabinets at will, effective within a range of up to three meters. This ability does not extend to appliances fitted with electronic locks.

* The ability to induce spontaneous combustion in humans and animals. This effect appears to be involuntary, and has only been observed when the subject is physically threatened (see Addendum).

**Addendum:** SCP-6735 was previously owned by Walter Henshaw (1807 - 1839), a British occultist and purported sorcerer residing in the town of Weyford, England. While scouring the residence for information regarding the origin of SCP-6735&#39;s anomalous properties, a piece of parchment bearing handwritten instructions was found folded within an alchemical textbook.

The contents of this document have been transcribed below: 

&gt; * Cut from the corpse of a thief hanged at dusk
&gt; 
&gt; * Bandage in funerary shroud sewn by a widow
&gt; 
&gt; * Store in earthen vessel, made with clay from a bishop&#39;s grave
&gt; 
&gt; * Powder with ferns plucked from a crossroads
&gt; 
&gt; * Pickle in brine of stolen salt, Marseilles vinegar and mare&#39;s urine
&gt; 
&gt; * Place by open window and leave sit for six days and nights
&gt; 
&gt; * Bake in oven until dry.

Henshaw&#39;s body was found on the floor of his private study, cause of death was deemed immolation. A shattered ceramic pot was discovered near the doorway.

Skeletal fragments from what was later confirmed to be a severed left hand were retrieved from Henshaw&#39;s garden. Item&#39;s origin remains unknown; laboratory analysis revealed trace amounts of linen cloth, candle wax, acetic acid and canine saliva.
