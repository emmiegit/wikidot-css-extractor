**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7211 is to be contained in a standard animate object containment unit at [[[scp-6868|Site-228]]]. It is to be placed on a pedestal and shielded with impact-resistant glass during experiments. Only one subject at a time is allowed to be in the testing chamber with SCP-7211.

**Description:** SCP-7211 is a 40 cm tall porcelain doll resembling a human male dressed in a red jester uniform, it is noted to have a distressed expression on its face. SCP-7211&#39;s anomalous properties will be triggered if there is at least one human being in SCP-7211&#39;s close proximity (2 meters or closer).

Once its anomalous properties are triggered SCP-7211 will become animate and start to speak. Usually, there is no conversation between SCP-7211 and the subjects, it usually stands up in front of the subjects and starts to tell various jokes, and puns. If the subjects don&#39;t find SCP-7211&#39;s performance funny they will start to cause self-harm and showcase temporary anomalous properties. (See Experiment log). 

If the subject leaves SCP-7211&#39;s vicinity regardless of willingly or not, SCP-7211 will return to its dormant state. Interviewed subjects described the experience as &#34;second-hand embarrassment cranked up to eleven&#34; in unison. 

**Experiment log:**

||~ **Subject** ||~ **Joke**||~ **Result**||
|| D-8567 || I&#39;m afraid for the calendar. Its days are numbered. || The chair D-8567 was sitting on suddenly transformed into a 100 kg tomato. D-8567 tried to lift it up and throw it at SCP-7211 but it was too heavy for him. ||
|| D-1462 || How do you follow Will Smith in the snow? You follow the fresh prints. || D-1462 began to scream then a glass window manifested on the wall and D-1462 jumped through it. The window itself disappeared and D-1462 was later found lying unconscious on Site Director Katona&#39;s office desk. ||
|| D-9966 || I only know 25 letters of the alphabet. I don&#39;t know y. || D-9966 ripped off both of his legs from mid-thigh and swallowed them whole then both legs grew back. ||
|| D-0007 || Why couldn&#39;t the bicycle stand up by itself? It was two tired. || D-0007 transformed into a bicycle and attempted to run over SCP-7211. Once the security personnel removed him from the testing chamber D-0007 transformed back but for the next two hours, he was only able to make sounds similar to a bicycle bell instead of human speech. ||
|| D-2377 || I once had a dream I was floating in an ocean of orange soda. It was more of a Fanta-sea. || D-2377 yelled &#34;I&#39;m sick of this planet!&#34; and his uniform transformed into a Superman costume then he breached containment by flying through the ceiling but later he was recaptured when he approached [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-lunar-area-32|Area-32.]]] His anomalous properties ceased an hour later.||
|| D-4544 || I&#39;m on a seafood diet. I see food and I eat it. || A bottle of Class-â–ˆ amnestic agent manifested in D-4544&#39;s hands which he drank resulting in the loss of at least five years of memories. ||
||D-4269[[footnote]]Using D-4269 for the test was originally recommended by the rest of the Site-228&#39;s D-Class personnel population because he is infamous for having a bad sense of humor. [[/footnote]] || When does a joke become a dad joke? When it becomes apparent. || D-4269 began to laugh so hard that he started to hyperventilate and was transferred to the medical wing. ||

Following the experiment with D-4269, SCP-7211&#39;s facial expression turned from distressed to cheerful and refused to tell jokes to subjects except for D-4269.
