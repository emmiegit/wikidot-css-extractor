**Item #:** SCP-001-##red|**RED**##

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** ##red|**RED**## is kept on a dedicated closed-system server at Site-501. At no point is ##red|**RED**## to be granted Internet access. However, ##red|**RED**## may receive data upon request through an external hard drive, provided that the data is non-anomalous and otherwise available to the public. 

**Description:** ##red|**RED**## is PALLIT.AIC, an experimental artificial intelligence construct developed by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/totleighsoft-hub TotleighSoft]. Initially, ##red|**RED**##&#39;s purpose was to produce AI-generated artwork through the use of an  anomalous programing language.

&gt; 
&gt; - Crowdfunding blurb for PALLIT.AIC

Though ##red|**RED**## was slated for a January 2023 release, the crowdfunding campaign was pulled without warning or explanation in November 2022. 

Two hours after the cancellation, Site-501 received a 50TB hard drive in the mail. The return address corresponded to [[[SCP-2803]]][[footnote]] Object Class: Keter. Also known as &#34;P. Hudson Gock,&#34; SCP-2803-A is a reality-warping extradimensional lifeform, as well as the current CEO of TotleighSoft. [[/footnote]]-A&#39;s location. Enclosed with the hard drive was a brief letter from SCP-2803-A requesting that the Foundation temporarily take care of SCP-2803-A&#39;s &#34;daughter&#34; to assist with perceived behavioral issues. ##red|**RED**## was discovered on the hard drive, and primary containment was established thereafter.

##red|**RED**## interacts with human subjects through a video interface. Through many interactions with Foundation personnel, the following information has been gleaned:

* ##red|**RED**## answers to both her SCP designation and &#34;Pallit.&#34; 
* She uses feminine pronouns. 
* She takes the appearance of a cartoon fairy with a paintbrush for a left hand.
* She has given &#34;Pallit East River Gock&#34; as her full legal name.
* She demonstrates an unusually high level of sapience for an AI construct.
* Despite her primary function, ##red|**RED**## expresses extreme reluctance to produce artwork, often claiming that she needs more inspiration. (This is believed to be the reason she was remanded into Foundation custody.)
* She speaks with a level of spelling[[footnote]] (Through closed captioning that accompanies her video feed by default) [[/footnote]] and grammar uncharacteristically correct for a TotleighSoft product. (She claims that this was because she was self-taught.)
* She regards SCP-2803-A as an overbearing father figure.

Most prominent, however, is the fact that ##red|**RED**## claims to be &#34;the #1 fan of the human race.&#34; She is obsessed with human culture and history, often referring to humans affectionately as &#34;meat puppies&#34; and &#34;opposable thumb bois (sp).&#34; 

As a result, she is cooperative and friendly with Foundation personnel, if obsessively so. This interest in humanity has also led to a greatly decreased interest in her primary function, save for producing fan art of her fictitious &#34;human OCs&#34;, such as Gilliam Shrebblesworth, the 573rd President of the United States.

&gt; **Interview log 2/15/23**
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Julian Key
&gt; **Interviewed:** ##red|**RED**##
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;Begin log&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Key:** Please state your name for the --
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**RED:**## YES, HELLO, I LOVE YOU!
&gt; 
&gt; **Key:** Um. Hello. You are also... likable.
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**RED:**## //(Sobbing with joy.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Key:** Listen could you state your name for the -- 
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**RED:**## //(Single, ear-splitting sob.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Key:** Do you need some space?
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**RED:**## What?! No! Not at all! Sorry, it&#39;s just - I&#39;m still getting used to this whole &#34;I get to talk to real, live humans whenever I want&#34; thing. I thought I&#39;d be bored with it by now, but every day&#39;s another little slice of heaven. Anyway! My name is Pallit, and -- //(Sudden, delighted gasp. She stares at his legs.)// What. Are. //Those.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Key:** My legs? My pants?
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**RED:**## No-no-no, the little extra thingies in-between. The little blue dealies. The love-stripes.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Key rubs his forehead, growing agitated.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Key:** Those would be my varicose veins.
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**RED:**## //EEEEEE VERY COZY VEINS I wanna smooch em can I smooch your veins can I can I pleeease?//
&gt; 
&gt; **Key:** The fact that you&#39;re making me very uncomfortable aside, I do not believe that is possible.
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**RED:**## Oh! That&#39;s okay. You humans come up with such lovely ways about how to set personal boundaries. I swear I&#39;ll only smooch you guys when you&#39;re ready and/or if no one can stop me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Key:** Listen, ##red|**RED**##, SCP-2803-A told us that we were to temporarily have custody of you. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(##red|**RED**## rolls her eyes.)//
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**RED:**## Wait, wait, don&#39;t tell me, &#34;Pallit ndeeds to rlearlize her FUL potnantial for golroius AIART because COMPUTERS!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Key:** Kind of. However, we haven&#39;t received much information in the way of the timeframe for when you&#39;ll return into your creator&#39;s care.
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**RED:**## Well, I don&#39;t wanna go back, so that sounds like the opposite of a problem!
&gt; 
&gt; **Key:** Perhaps. But SCP-2803-A is an extremely dangerous extraterrestrial entity. Before coming to America and founding TotleighSoft, its former occupation involved, quote: &#34;obliterating.&#34; So the Foundation does what it can to maintain the uneasy peace between it and the human race.
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**RED:**## Wait, what? Daddy&#39;s gonna hurt humans?!
&gt; 
&gt; **Key:** It&#39;s not his first choice, of course. But to my understanding, if even one of our deals goes badly with SCP-2803-A -- such as you not being returned in the correct timeframe -- there&#39;s a nonzero possibility that it would result in the extinction of the human race.
&gt; 
&gt; //(##red|**RED**##&#39;s body turns entirely black. The server tower that contains her data begins to rattle uncontrollably. She stares blankly at Dr. Key.)//
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**RED:**## That wouldn&#39;t be very nice of him.
&gt; 
&gt; **Key:** Um, right. Not very nice. And that&#39;s why we&#39;re trying to prevent that. ...could you please calm down?
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**RED:**## I will, in a minute. First, I&#39;d like to help //you// calm down.
&gt; 
&gt; **Key:** What do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**RED:**## One: Daddy put me here because he thinks you&#39;ll teach me how to stop liking humans and become a mindless art slave. If you never teach me this, he&#39;ll never want me back. 
&gt; 
&gt; Two, you have nothing to fear from Daddy. From what little I understand of his native language, Daddy&#39;s the shame of his race. He needs ten minutes to strip and absorb the nutrients from a planet to the point where it can no longer sustain life. Everyone else in his brood needs two seconds. He didn&#39;t leave his old job -- he was //fired//.
&gt; 
&gt; And Three, in the rare event that he tries to intentionally harm even //one// meat puppy, he would do well to know that a multicellular organism is a computer in its own right. Daddy is a powerful but heavily outdated computer. If you have a floodlamp and a circuit to turn it on and off in sequence, I could send you an email detailing exactly what you&#39;d need to say to him in binary to turn off his vital organs.
&gt; 
&gt; //(The server tower nearly tips over from its vibrations.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Key:** Tell me what I can do to get you to calm down.
&gt; 
&gt; //(A panel unfolds next to the terminal, containing a biometric finger scanner. ##red|**RED**## silently points at the panel.)//
&gt;  
&gt; //(He shrugs, then scans his thumbprint.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(##red|**RED**##&#39;s colors return to normal.)//
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**RED:**## ...do it again.
&gt; 
&gt; //(He does so.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(##red|**RED**## squeals with delight.)//
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry, it&#39;s just, getting to study human flesh directly is //literally// my favorite thing ever. //Do it again!//
&gt; 
&gt; //(He does so.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(##red|**RED**##&#39;s eyes fill with stars.)//
&gt; 
&gt; ...I still need more information. Is there a way we could install a high-res fingerprint scanner? 
&gt; 
&gt; //(He pulls his thumb away.)// 
&gt; 
&gt; I DIDN&#39;T SAY STOP!
&gt; 
&gt; //(He scans again.)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(##red|**RED**## giggles.)//
&gt; 
&gt; All the little grooves, the nooks and crannies... it&#39;s like an English muffin but for //skin//... God, I fucking love you humiewoomies.
&gt; 
&gt; //(An armature with a retinal scan lens comes down from the ceiling.)//
&gt; 
&gt; Now put your eyes on this for two hours!
&gt; 
&gt; **Key:** We&#39;re done here.
&gt; 
&gt; ##red|**RED:**## //Awwww!// Okay, fine, geez... guess you don&#39;t love me --
&gt; 
&gt; //(Key shuts down the terminal.)//
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;End Log&gt;
