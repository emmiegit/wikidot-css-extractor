6 AM. The sun is barely over the horizon, the world still a deep blue with tinges of flaming orange and soft pink in the sky. Everything is **silent** for the briefest of moments-

##ba650b|//Why do children wake up so early?//##

She&#39;s jumping on the bed. Crushing my legs beneath her. I don&#39;t care. I know what&#39;s coming.

##b23ea1|&#34;It&#39;s Sunday!&#34;##

##ba650b|//It&#39;s Sunday.//##

Get out of bed, flick on the lights. Kiss my wife good morning. Brush my teeth, shave, and she&#39;s still at my side. She&#39;s always by my side. 

##b23ea1|&#34;Come on, Daddy! It&#39;s time for breakfast!&#34;##

##ba650b|&#34;Breakfast?!&#34;## I growl, raising my arms menacingly. ##ba650b|&#34;Breakfast for the //tickle monster!//&#34;## 

She squeals with laughter and jumps back, but I grab her, lift her up. She&#39;s giggling like mad.

##ba650b|//She deserves the world.//##

I carry her down the stairs as she squirms and laughs. She asks if she can put the chocolate chips in the batter.

##ba650b|&#34;I don&#39;t know, only the best of the best can put them in...think you can handle it?&#34;##

##b23ea1|&#34;I&#39;m the //best// chocolate-chipper, Daddy! In the whole wide world!&#34;##

She&#39;s right, of course. You can&#39;t find a better chocolate-chipper anywhere.

We assemble the tools of our trade: griddle, bowls, wood spoons, spatulas, chocolate chips, batter. She mixes it herself, a true pancake champion among mere mortals. The counter-top shows the evidence of her work, the remnants of her art. At least, that&#39;s what I tell her. I&#39;ll have to clean it later, but I don&#39;t mind. Anything for her.

I scoop the batter onto the hot griddle, and she prepares the chocolate chips. She drops a few onto the first pancake.

##ba650b|&#34;Pshwuuaaaaah!&#34;## I go as the chocolate chips hit the surface. She giggles. That sound could make me happy for a lifetime.

We let the pancakes sit on the griddle as we move to the living room. She boots up the television as I sit on the couch. She&#39;s watching some kids&#39; cartoon.

The room grows a little fuzzy. I&#39;m still exhausted. I lean my head back a little and close my eyes. ##ba650b|//Just a moment&#39;s rest,//## I tell myself. 

It...

##f7f7f7|{{Soon, you will be with me. Soon, I will control you, and everything you are. I am the future, the past, the present.}}##

###f7f7f7|The world was swimming. Colors- vibrant, piercing colors were everywhere.##

##f7f7f7|{{Your perception of free will is only what I allow you to see.}}##

##f7f7f7|There was no up, no down. No left or right.##

##f7f7f7|{{For I decide what you do, what you all do and you all feel.}}##

##f7f7f7|Spinning, swirling, tumbling, floati-##

[[size xx-small]]##b23ea1|&#34;Daddy!&#34;##[[/size]]

##f7f7f7|{{Wake up.}}##

[[a style=&#34;color: #f7f7f7&#34; href=&#34;http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-world-within&#34;]]everything was wrong nothing was where it should be and the world was turning and[[/a]]

[[size x-small]]##b23ea1|&#34;Daddy!&#34;##[[/size]]

##f7f7f7|{{Wake up.}}##

##f7f7f7|None of the world was the way it should be and nothing made any sense and nothing was where it belonged and the world was turning and##

[[size small]]##b23ea1|&#34;Daddy!&#34;##[[/size]]

##f7f7f7|{{WAKE UP.}}##

My eyes fly open as I hear her yell.

##b23ea1|&#34;Daddy! The pancakes!&#34;##

I bolt upright and rush to the kitchen, but I&#39;m too late. Where the pancakes should be are shriveled, burnt pieces of batter. I look back at her. She&#39;s staring up at me, her bottom lip quivering. Tears well in her eyes, spilling over in slow streaks down her face.

##b23ea1|&#34;The...the pancakes...&#34;## she whimpers. 

##ba650b|&#34;Hey, no, baby, it&#39;s okay, it&#39;s okay, baby.&#34;## I scoop her up. ##ba650b|&#34;We&#39;ll go to the store, we&#39;ll get more batter, okay?&#34;##

She stares at me with wet eyes. ##b23ea1|&#34;...Promise?&#34;##

##ba650b|&#34;Of course.&#34;## There&#39;s thuds on the stairs as my wife descends.

##247237|&#34;Was something burning?&#34;## She enters the room, a concerned look on her face.

##ba650b|&#34;The pancakes, but we&#39;re going to go out and get more batter.&#34;##

My wife gives an exaggerated gasp and places a hand over her heart. ##247237|&#34;Then there isn&#39;t a moment to lose! To the car!&#34;## She grabs her from me and lifts her up high. 

She squeals with delight. ##b23ea1|&#34;Mommy&#39;s coming with us!&#34;## She jumps out of my wife&#39;s arms and puts her hands on her hips, a triumphant hero in the dark night of pancake-treachery. ##b23ea1|&#34;To the car!&#34;##

##ba650b|&#34;To the car!&#34;## She bursts out the door and runs to the car as fast as her little legs will carry her. ##ba650b|&#34;You&#39;re a good mother.&#34;## I give her a peck on the lips.

##247237|&#34;You&#39;re a good father.&#34;## She smiles at me.

##b23ea1|&#34;Mommy! Daddy! Come on!&#34;## We chuckle and head out to the car.

------

**Five more turns to the grocery store.** To pancake-y glory. ##f7f7f7|{{Soon.}}##

##b23ea1|&#34;Look Mommy, a bluebird! That&#39;s your favorite!&#34;##

##247237|&#34;Yes it is, good job, Tanya!&#34;##

##b23ea1|&#34;Look, Daddy, it&#39;s so pretty!&#34;##

##ba650b|&#34;I can&#39;t, Tanny, I&#39;m driving.&#34;##

##b23ea1|&#34;Oh yeah, sorry!&#34;##

**Four more turns.** ##f7f7f7|{{It&#39;s all coming together.}}##

##247237|&#34;We should get the store brand batter, it&#39;s much cheaper than-&#34;##

##b23ea1|&#34;Noooo! The store batter isn&#39;t as good!&#34;##

I shrug. ##ba650b|&#34;She&#39;s got a point, hon.&#34;##
##f7f7f7|{{It all goes silent.}}##
My wife huffs.
##f7f7f7|{{Silent. Silent. It all goes //SILENT//.}}##
**Three turns.**
##f7f7f7|{{//**SILENTSILENTSILENTSILENTSILENTSILENTSILENTSILENTSILENT**//}}##
##ba650b|&#34;Tanny, will you //please// stop kicking the back of my chair?&#34;##
##f7f7f7|{{SILENT.}}##
##b23ea1|&#34;But I&#39;m nooot!&#34;##
##f7f7f7|{{IT ALL.}}##
My wife unbuckles her seat-belt to turn around a little. ##247237|&#34;Tanya Kate, stop kicking your father&#39;s chair.&#34;## She starts to turn back around and re-buckle her seat-belt, and there are only
##f7f7f7|{{GOES.}}##
**Two tur-**
[[size xx-large]] ##f7f7f7|{{**SILENT**.}}## [[/size]]
Tanya screams. The truck slams into the side of our car and crumples it like a tin can. The sounds of glass shattering, tires screaming, metal crumbling. The airbags deploy as I&#39;m thrown against the window, which cracks against my head. My wife, still unbuckled, slams into my side. There&#39;s a strangled ##247237|//&#34;URKH-&#34;//## before her neck is snapped by the force of her head, which slams into the side of my seat. As I black out, I see Tanya&#39;s body go through her window.

The ringing in my ears still does not stop as I shake the hand of the Site Director of Site-81 and accept my position.

Safe-class objects. I stare at those words on the paper in my hands.

Safe. 

//Safe//.

...{{And yet.}} ##f7f7f7|{{I am anything but.}}##

I step into the hallway with the Site Director for a Site-wide tour. The ringing in my ears grows louder as we travel. We pass multiple containment chambers - [[[SCP-2151 | a set of rings that fuse people together]]], [[[SCP-2398 | a baseball bat that blows up living things]]], [[[SCP-3864 | a painting that]]] -
