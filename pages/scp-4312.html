**Item #:** SCP-4312

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** As there is currently no known method of containing or preventing SCP-4312, efforts are to be focused on preventing the spread of information about SCP-4312. Online communications are to be monitored for instances of SCP-4312, and any civilian demonstrating knowledge of SCP-4312 is to be administered a textual amnestic. Suppression and removal of civilian evidence of SCP-4312 is considered a Level 2 priority.

**Description:** SCP-4312 is the inversion and reduction of gravitational force on an individual (designated SCP-4312-1.) During an SCP-4312 event, gravity exerts a margin[[footnote]] Exact rate unknown. No video documentation of SCP-4312 has been able to provide a definitive scale. [[/footnote]] of its typical force in precisely the opposite direction as would be expected on the instance of SCP-4312-1. SCP-4312 manifests at random intervals, but is estimated to have approximately one instance every ten days. The only observed criteria for an individual becoming an instance of SCP-4312-1 is that the subject is not inside an enclosed structure at the time.

**Addendum 4312-A:**
//On 1/9/2018, Agent Abigail Kelana was affected by SCP-4312 while on vacation in Hawaii.//
[[collapsible hideLocation=&#34;both&#34; show=&#34;+ Recovered footage&#34; hide=&#34;- Close. &#34;]]

//Agent Kelana was taking a video of a waterfall in Maui at the time of the SCP-4312 event.//
&gt; = **VIDEO LOG**
&gt; ----
&gt; **//[BEGIN LOG]//**
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Kelana:** Huh? 
&gt; 
&gt; //[The camera shakes, falls, and dangles from Agent Kelana&#39;s neck. It is pointing up toward her face. She is holding on to something off-frame, feet dangling toward the sky.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Kelana:** What the hell? Okay, okay. I&#39;m safe for now. You&#39;re safe, Ab. Just some weird stuff, nothing too crazy, you&#39;ve seen worse. My camera&#39;s dangling the correct down, not... holy shit.
&gt; 
&gt; //[The leaf supporting Agent Kelana tears loudly and detaches from the trunk of the tree.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Kelana:** Oh come ON!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Kelana:** Not good not good not good no fucking bueno... Okay, deep breaths.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Kelana:** This has to undo itself sometime. I need a parachute or a glider or... something. Inventory: I&#39;ve got my hiking stuff, a decent sized leaf, and a camera. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[The camera twists away from Agent Kelana.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Kelana:** Not sure what a call for evac can do here, but if I ever needed one, it&#39;s now.
&gt; 
&gt; //[The cap from Agent Kelana&#39;s standard-issue distress beacon falls past the camera.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Kelana:** I&#39;m not going fast. I&#39;ve got time. I&#39;ve... I&#39;ve got time. Fuck, a sleeping bag won&#39;t cut it if I go too high. It&#39;s like really shitty flying. Is this a skip? This has to be a skip... is this happening to everybody?
&gt; 
&gt; //[Agent Kelana can be heard searching her bag.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Kelana:** God damn it. I set my fucking tablet down to film. Of course. Of fucking course. Could be a whatever-K and I don&#39;t get to know. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[By this point, the palm tree Agent Kelana clung to is indistinguishable by the camera&#39;s current settings.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Kelana:** How is filming a waterfall at night more dangerous than staffing a fucking jail for monsters? 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Agent Kelana grabs the camera, ending the first video and immediately beginning another.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Kelana:** You guys view these sequentially. This happened when I was viewing a waterfall. If I don&#39;t make it... The previous video had the waterfall in it. Make sure it&#39;s not memetic or some shit. I don&#39;t know... I&#39;ll get back down and tell you in person. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Agent Kelana lets the camera dangle against the strap again and can be heard searching her bag. After six minutes, she picks up the camera again, holding a makeshift parachute constructed from twine, the palm tree leaf, and her sleeping bag.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Kelana:** I&#39;m ok if this breaks my legs.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Agent Kelana goes quiet for six seconds.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Kelana:** It&#39;s getting... kind of hard to breathe, and this thing isn&#39;t producing as much drag as I thought. Not a good sign... Not, uh, a good sign.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Agent Kelana stops talking and hyperventilates for ten seconds.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Kelana:** Kinda cold... Can&#39;t... feel hands. Shit. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Kelana:** I&#39;m dying, aren&#39;t I?
&gt; 
&gt; //[Agent Kelana attaches her camera and distress beacon to the parachute.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Kelana:** Always thought it&#39;d be more... violent?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Kelana:** Huh.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Kelana:** I&#39;m going to watch the stars.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Agent Kelana throws her parachute towards Earth. The camera descends facing upwards until the parachute deploys after approximately ten seconds of free fall.]//
