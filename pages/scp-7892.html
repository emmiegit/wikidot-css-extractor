**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7892 is currently only allowed to be performed for research purposes. Research on SCP-7892 must first be permitted unanimously by Site-50’s Director,[[footnote]]Director Sesshou Mamiya, able to perform.[[/footnote]] Site-50’s Head of Research,[[footnote]]Hirayuki Handa, unable to perform.[[/footnote]] Site-50’s History Department Lead, [[footnote]]Coco Mamiya, able to perform.[[/footnote]] and Site-50’s RAISA Liaison.[[footnote]]Pi-twan Hsueh, able to perform.[[/footnote]] If all four members approve the proposal, it is to be sent for review to the East Asian Regional Council. Only with their approval may SCP-7892 be performed.

SCP-7892 research may only be performed by members of Provisional Task Force Kappa-70 (“Prisoners of 和”). PTF Kappa-70 will continually be replenished by individuals able to perform, preferably from GoI prisoners and/or terminally ill patients. If this were not to be possible, PTF Kappa-70 will be replenished by willing participants. No willing participant will be considered for research if any other choice is available.

No efforts are to be made to conceal or prohibit entrance into the Yasukuni Shrine. No efforts are to be made to blockade or prohibit praying to the Kami enshrined here. No efforts are to be made to remove enshrined Kami from the Book of Souls,[[footnote]]Registry of all names of the Kami enshrined inside of the shrine.[[/footnote]] but the true list is to be exchanged for one with names of deceased people up to the signing of the Treaty of Peace with Japan.

No member of the Foundation or of any allied group with connections to any enshrined Kami is to --perform SCP-7892-- step inside the Yasukuni Shrine’s Inner Garden. This is not to be enforced; however, no recovery attempts will be made in the event a member is discovered doing so.

**Description:** SCP-7892 is a ritual that can only be performed within the premises of the Yasukuni Shrine,[[footnote]]Shrine that commemorates those who’ve died while in service of Japan. Internationally known for enshrining 1,068 Kami convicted of war crimes, including 14 class-A war criminals.[[/footnote]] Chiyoda City, Tokyo Prefecture. The ritual is believed to be able to dimensionally translocate the performer into another universe, reality, or theological realm. The only remnants of the action are their existence in the memory of other people able to perform SCP-7892, sudden Akiva spikes at the time of performance, and their names appearing on the official list of enshrined Kami in Yasukuni Shrine’s Book of Souls,[[footnote]]The originally intended list of names contains all who’ve died in service of Japan from the beginning of the Boshin War in 1868, until the signing of the Treaty of Peace with Japan in 1951, making up for approx. 2,500,000 Kami. A further 1,100,000 who died during occult battles, including the 6th and 7th Occult War are included in the list.[[/footnote]] People attempting to find information about SCP-7892 or its performers are to be amnesticized and, if necessary, integrated into PTF Kappa-70.

SCP-7892 can only be performed by people with blood ties with any Kami enshrined inside the Yasukuni Shrine. It is not known how the binding spell of the ritual recognizes blood ties, but direct and indirect descendants, as well as non-recognized descendants are known to be able to perform the ritual. The ritual is believed to work similarly to the ritual present on [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2937 SCP-2937]; due to the innate threat of using SCP-2937, this conjecture cannot and will not be proven. Of note is that not all targets capable of performing SCP-7892 will perform the ritual. Those who do perform it, however, appear to enter a fugue state, and stop responding to outside stimuli.

It is not known how an individual learns how to perform SCP-7892, as no member who has performed it is believed to have known it beforehand. The performance itself is also only rudimentarily understood. While a target unable to perform it can document SCP-7892’s performance, crucial steps are either only available to other performers, or a cognitohazardous effect stops a non-performer from perceiving them.

Due to this nature, it is also not known when the first performance of the ritual was conducted, but it is believed to have been enacted at some point after the construction of the Reijibo Hoanden[[footnote]]Repository building for the Book of Souls.[[/footnote]] in 1975. SCP-7892’s creation has been attributed to remnants of the IJAMEA,[[footnote]]Imperial Japanese Anomalous Matters Examination Agency was Imperial Japan’s official anomaly agency. Dissolved then integrated into the Foundation in 1951. Remnants of the IJAMEA are known to still exist, colloquially referred to as “Kakure Shogun”.[[/footnote]] although no evidence of this exists.

**History:** The first confirmed occurrence is the disappearance of Hinata Kurata, Tsukasa Kurata, and Miyamoto Ienaga in 2014. All three were members of the Greater Japan Patriotic Party, a far-right political party of Japan, with the two former also suspected of being “Kakure Shogun”, the latter having known ties with the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-jp#five-elements-association Gogyō-Kessha].[[footnote]]Hostile anti-anomalous association who wishes to rid Japan of all anomalous influence. Member of the Global Occult Coalition’s Council of 108, although the two entities are often at odds due to ideological differences.[[/footnote]]

Due to their ties with known antagonistic GoIs, a search party was sent to the Yasukuni Shrine as another party was sent to interrogate potential witnesses. It is here that two of the agents in the search party, Rebecca Roberts and Mari Iwanaga, disappeared as well. Despite a behavior believed to have heavily deviated from standard procedures, no member of the search party reported anything unusual. Instead, the Head Priest, who at the time was being interviewed, was the only one to react to the event:

**Head Priest:** …Ah. There’s been two more.

**Toyohisa:** Hm? Did you say something?[[footnote]]Up until this point, the head priest had remained silent.[[/footnote]]

**Head Priest:** The doves are singing, and the cherry trees blossom, because it knows two more have joined them.[[footnote]]The shrine contains 500 doves and 600 cherry trees. No doves were heard singing, nor any of the cherry trees were blooming at the time.[[/footnote]]

**Toyohisa:** Singing? What do you mean, singing?

**Head Priest:** They are celebrating the arrival of the Kami. The shrine expands. All are joyous. Can’t you hear it, Kogiku? Can’t you hear the reverence of the old Gods? The cheers of the new? A parade of a thousand horses, all carrying the palanquins? Praise be to Rebecca Roberts, she who honors her parents, who in turn honor theirs. Praise be to Mari Iwanaga, she who honors her parents, who in turn honor theirs. And they honor theirs, and they honor theirs. All the way to He who took on the name of Jinmu, who honored the Great Ninigi-no-Mikoto, who in turn honored the Great Amaterasu-Oomikami.[[footnote]]Jinmu was the first emperor of Japan.

Following this event, and a minimum of three others, Foundation prepared for testing of the exact working of SCP-7892. At this time, it was only known that the ritual started at the shrine’s Daiichi Torii,[[footnote]]First gate of the shrine, located inside of the Outer Garden, in front of Omura Masujiro’s statue, the founder of the Imperial Japanese Army.[[/footnote]] and finished

**Date:** 2014/06/08

**Interviewer:** Agent Hibiki Ogawa
-----
**&lt;00:00&gt;** - Recording starts. Agent is 100 meters from the first torii gate.

**&lt;01:35&gt;** - Agent passes by the first torii gate, but not before praying in front of it. Agent is heard whispering //”thank you”// before entering the Outer Garden.

**&lt;04:41&gt;** - Agent passes by the second torii gate, not before praying in front of it. Agent then turns left, and walks to the Temizuya[[footnote]]Area where the //temizu// ritual is performed. Hands and mouth are washed with water, purifying the visitor before entering the shrine.[[/footnote]] to purify herself.

**&lt;06:01&gt;** - Agent turns right, towards the dove cote. Doves are heard cooing constantly. She walks in front of it, before praying once more. The cooing stops.

**&lt;06:55&gt;** - Agent walks towards the Sanshuden hall. The door opens on its own in front of her. The agent enters, then moves towards an empty reception room. She sits down, and begins conversing, despite being alone. Speech is consistent with petitions to worship enshrined Kami. Agent reveals information regarding her grandfather, as well as information regarding six other family members who are enshrined in Yasukuni. Information given includes a concise life history, major accomplishments, committed crimes, among other details. Some of these details involve behind-the-veil activities, and were not known to the Foundation, nor to the agent.

**&lt;14:17&gt;** - Camera turns off for three seconds. Once the camera comes back on, the agent is standing in front of the Main Sanctuary. The sky and bushes around the sanctuary appear to slightly pulsate. Whether this is actually occurring, or is some sort of camera disruption is not known.

**&lt;14:43&gt;** - Agent prostrates, assuming the dogeza position, then begins chanting what is believed to be a prayer or a mantra. Doves cooing are heard again.

**&lt;15:37&gt;** - Sounds of people marching are heard around the agent, walking to her left and right, towards the sanctuary. Agent continues praying.

**&lt;31:19&gt;** - Agent finishes praying at the same time the sound of footsteps stops being heard. Agent raises her head, and moves towards the sanctuary.

**&lt;32:20&gt;** - Agent stops at the entrance of the sanctuary, and begins screaming, banging her hands on the wooden floor with enough force to break her right hand. The tips of a pair of shoes can be seen at the top of the camera, standing in front of the agent.

**&lt;36:01&gt;** - The shoes move back, disappearing from view.

**&lt;41:12&gt;** - Agent raises her head once more, before exiting the sanctuary, and walking towards the Reijibo Hoanden repository.

**&lt;44:47&gt;** - Upon reaching the repository, the agent notices the doors are entirely missing. Several pages and archives of the Book of Souls are seen outside, apparently having been thrown from the inside.

**&lt;45:01&gt;** - Agent picks up one of the pages, before stopping screaming. She looks at it, the page containing information on one of her ancestors. She pockets it, before walking towards the next paper. This action is repeated a total of seven times.

**&lt;47:36&gt;** - Agent walks inside the repository, carrying the papers. In the middle of the room, she sees an empty page sitting upon a lectern. Behind the lectern, the statue of Omura Masujiro can be seen.

**&lt;49:02&gt;** - The agent pulls an ink brush from the statue, then writes her name on the empty paper. Agent is seen prostrating herself on the ground, head against the ground as she begins repeating the words “thank you”. Due to her position, the camera is obstructed.

**&lt;51:22&gt;** - The cooing of the doves stops at the same time a sudden Akiva spike is detected. Five seconds later, the agent stops vocalizing. Twelve seconds later, the camera turns off.

Ten minutes later, a team reached the repository building, the camera found inside of it. The insides of the camera had been replaced by incense ash. Agent Hibiki was nowhere to be seen. Of note is that both the statue and the repository doors were in their usual positions, and no proof of their movement was detected.

Following the event, a further fifty five explorations attempts were conducted, ten of them successful, leading to the discovery of the following characteristics:
* SCP-7892 performers will stop reacting to outside stimuli, and will only react according to the performance.
* SCP-7892 performers gain all knowledge of any family member enshrined at the Shrine.
* SCP-7892 performers are able to accomplish supernatural feats without damage to themselves (Not proven; damage might be dispensed to them, but is not known to any observers)
* During the performance, SCP-7892 performers might encounter anomalous events related to events in the lives of their ancestors.
* SCP-7892 performers will arrive at the repository no matter what events happen beforehand. The statue of Omura Masujiro will be present near or inside the building.
* The exact moment at which an SCP-7892 performer disappears cannot be registered. (Not proven; however, all attempts to record it so far have failed.)

Following concerns by the Ethics Committee, the exploration phase reached its end. Entrance to the repository for the Book of Souls was prohibited, with a team of guards unable to perform SCP-7892 guarding the building at all times.

The Yasukuni Shrine suffered several attempts to breach into the repository throughout a period of 7 months following its closure, culminating on Incident 7892-1 on 2017/03/15, at exactly 12:00, when 1,851 people entered the Yasukuni Shrine and forcibly started several SCP-7892 performances. Despite the Foundation and the Metropolitan Police’s Special Affairs Division attempting to disperse the performers, flocks of white doves coming from the Shrine interfered, personnel finding themselves [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-514 unable to act while the doves were present]. A further 35 members of personnel assisting at the time became SCP-7892 performers, with each performer disappearing throughout a period of five hours, their names added to the Book of Souls. The event required a mass amnestization campaign, with information on SCP-7892 being shared with relevant parties and involved GoIs, a meeting being held the following week. As a result, several further tests were performed in an attempt to either contain, pacify or eliminate the anomaly.

**Experiment:** Utilization of clones of personnel able to perform SCP-7892 to carry out the rituals.

**Proposed by:** Special Affairs Division, Tokyo Prefecture, Chiyoda Ward Department

**Results:** Clone of individual-45981 entered Yasukuni Shrine, and performed SCP-7892. Upon the finalization of the ritual, the clone disappeared. At the same time, individual-45981 falls into unconsciousness. Further analysis shows that the individual had lost their soul (//tamashii//), which had turned into a Kami at the shrine (//mitama//). Further experiments with cloning and other human replications yielded similar results.

Following the last experiment proposal, Shūshū-In’s archivist Higashikuni offered themselves for the ritual. While the Higashikuni-no-miya branch was abolished in 1947, due to family enshrined in Yasukuni, as well as recent political movements to reinstate abolished branches of the Imperial Family, they were deemed a suitable candidate for the experiment.

The experiment was initially proposed under the belief that members of the Imperial House would be more effective targets when performing SCP-7892, and would thus increase the period of time necessary between each performance.[[footnote]]While the period between each performance has not been estimated, it is believed that able performers will begin approaching the shrine if SCP-7892 is not performed each 10-12 days.[[/footnote]]

Substantial deviations were immediately noticed, as Higashikuni was unable to recall the steps for the performance of SCP-7892, and had to be guided by others based on previous documented information. They remained lucid throughout the entire procedure.

Upon reaching the repository, they found its doors open, with the Statue of Omura Masujiro inside. Events following their entrance into the repository are as follows:

**Higashikuni:** (//Chuckles//) I am much more attuned towards Eastern Studies, I’m afraid, but I believe it’s quite the similar experience. Learning from the past and the present, such that we know better in the future… This shrine is just like such a text. It teaches the same principles that seemed so foreign to us in the past. The same that still escapes our grasp today. And although there’s many messages contained within, contradicting each other, muddying each other… One still stands the test of time, escaping tear, redaction, and revision.

(//Silence.//)

**Higashikuni:** People live because they want peace. No one wishes to live for strife. We live yearning for peace, and we pray so that the dead may reach it. We live our lives in the hopes that there’ll be someone to remember us, someone to pray for us when we’re no longer here. To disregard this is unfair to those who are alive. It’s unfair to the dead too. There’s no free ticket to any Heaven. There shouldn’t be one.

(//Silence. Higashikuni stands up.//)

**Higashikuni:** I suppose you’re right. I shouldn’t force my beliefs onto others. Equally, you shouldn’t either. It’s not fair to make a choice that is theirs. Choices have been made without considering the recipients too many times in the past. This shrine and many others were built so that its victims could find peace. So let them make their choice, because it is theirs, and no one else’s.

(//Higashikuni pulls out an ink brush from their person, before putting it down on the lectern. They were not carrying this item when they entered the shrine.//)

**Higashikuni:** It was a pleasure to speak with you, master. I shall take my leave now.

(//Higashikuni puts their hands together in prayer, then bow their head before leaving the building. While the camera doesn’t capture this, based on sound, it is believed the statue bows as well.//)

Post-event interview revealed that Archivist Higashikuni had managed to appease the statue (Now designated as SCP-7892-1), and SCP-7892 events would no longer need to occur. However, SCP-7892 can still be performed, leading to the same results.

”[...] He’s an old man stuck in his old ways. I cannot blame him for it; there’s the likes of him still alive today. I much prefer the likes of him than those who visit the shrine and pray for it, not for the sake of the dead, but for their own sake. He still fights for Japan, for the Army, for the Emperor. And yet, he fights not with guns and swords, but by offering an open door to those who need it. A place to belong.

Maybe the home he offers is not one liked by many. I’m sure many of the people listening to my words oppose it. I do too. I can’t say I agree with the man, but I can understand him. A place that accepts you is better than none at all. And so the shrine will continue to accept those who fight for an empire that no longer exists, and people will pray for them, because they have found peace in this. [...]”

“[...] I recommend you keep that place open. You cannot deny that which is owed to the dead. That being said, living people should be barred from writing their names in the Book of Souls. That place is not one of honor; not for the living, at the very least. It could never be. There’s many places that accept the living. This is not one of them. [...]”

Since this event, SCP-7892’s steps have been fully deduced, and the ritual has been used a total of 37 times by Foundation and Foundation-allied personnel. Usage of SCP-7892 has received mixed responses from both national and international organizations, including other Foundation Sites and Branches. Following internal pressure, SCP-7892’s usage approval was delegated to the East Asian Regional Council.

14 requests to use SCP-7892 to enshrine retired personnel and other key members of the Foundation able to perform the ritual before their natural death have been submitted to the East Asian Regional Council since then. 8 have been denied, 3 have become invalid, and 3 remain under consideration. No further requests are to be made until all remaining requests are resolved.
