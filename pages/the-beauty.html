The following is a series of emails between attendees of the Denver Anartist Exhibition 2023 relating to an incident that took place shortly after. If you have any further information, please let me know via email at daroldg@awcy.lol.

Dear Arnold,

I attended the recent art exhibition here in Denver last week, and your piece, //The Beauty//, certainly caught my eye.

The way the painting depicts such a strange creature, draped in darkness and with such vibrant glowing eyes, something clearly quite intimidating under such a title is fascinating. It leads the viewer to ponder the beauty of the monstrous and inhuman, the things that many assume wish to harm them, rightfully or otherwise. I noticed as well that it seemed to enrapture a few attendees associated with the Serpent&#39;s Hand for that very reason, an audience that some artists claim are impossible to capture with their works.

As for your flourishes, shall we call them: I found myself struggling to look away as I stared into the depths of the vivid red eyes, dark fur, and sharp appendages. Such a meme that forces attention to be given is rather amateur and unbecoming of a true anartist, in my own critical opinion, I must admit. If that were all, it certainly would&#39;ve ruined my perception of the portrait. However, the feeling of dread and being watched that you managed to weave into the canvas more than made up for it. For a moment, it was as if it wasn&#39;t a painting at all.

Truly well-done. Though it was by no means a perfect work, I feel //The Beauty// was a stand-out piece at the exhibition, and I must award bonus points for standing out without hurting anyone.

[[&gt;]]
May this email find you in good spirits,
-Larry

Dear Larry,

Thank you for your glowing review of my painting. I&#39;ve heard a few similarly pleasant responses, but none quite as strong as yours. It&#39;s really fulfilling to hear a known critic take such a liking to a piece of mine, especially since among critic circles in particular I&#39;ve found little success.

I&#39;ll let you in on a little secret, though; I didn&#39;t include any memes in my piece. That was what was intended to make it stand out, in fact. It leaves the viewer wondering what effect it&#39;s meant to have. I know it&#39;s a bit cliche by now and it&#39;s hardly been effective since it&#39;s been done before, but it seems to have captured people to such an extent they&#39;ve hardly noticed.

Thank you for your message, truly. It&#39;s made my day. I intend to attend the exhibition in Chicago next year as well, especially with how well my painting did here in Denver. Please do let me know if you&#39;ll attend.

Best wishes,
-Arnold

Dear Darold,

Have you heard from Larry Schumer recently?

He reached out to me regarding The Beauty after seeing it at the Denver art exhibition you hosted. He did not respond to my email I sent in response, in which I asked if he were planning to attend next year&#39;s Chicago exhibition, nor did he respond to any further attempts to contact him.

If you know where he&#39;s been hiding, I&#39;d love to hear.

And by the way, the event went excellently. Great job there.

Cheers,
-Arnold

I&#39;m glad to hear you enjoyed the event. As for the whereabouts of Larry, I don&#39;t believe anyone has heard from him since. A wellness check was requested on his home recently by another concerned critic, but he wasn&#39;t there. I&#39;ve attached the related police report below.

[[/=]]
**Date:** __11/16/2023__
**Reporting Officer:** __Dale Brinks__
**Incident:** __Wellness Check, Missing Person__
----
**Detail of Event:**
A wellness check was requested on the home of Larry Schumer.

Scratch marks were discovered in the siding of the house up to 4 feet above the ground. At the Southern end of the house, a large bedroom window was shattered. Most of the bedding had been partially torn and was on the floor.

Foliage in the woods outside the home was roughly cut as if by a machete in the area directly outside the home. Cut foliage made a path roughly 60 feet into the woods before stopping abruptly.

Larry Schumer was not present.

**Action Taken:**
A missing person report has been filed. No further action taken.

Hi Arnold,
I was just at the exhibition thing in Denver. I know the event ended a while ago, but I&#39;m good friends with Darold, and he let me into the back to look at the paintings that hadn&#39;t been sent back yet.
Your painting The Beauty was really interesting. I like how it really makes you think about the artistic value of a background, not even having any fancy effects to mess with the viewer, just letting them take it in. It&#39;s not often you see a painting with no clear subject. The way the foliage disappears into the dark makes you think there&#39;d be something there emerging from it, which really makes it feel like a background to a piece that&#39;s missing something in the foreground rather than just a landscape. Really cool stuff, and I think I have a better appreciation for what goes on behind the subject of an artwork now.
Peace, Brick
