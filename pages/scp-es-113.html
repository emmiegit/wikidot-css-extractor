Facility-13 (2013-Present)
[[/div]]
[[/div]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** Facility-13 [[footnote]] Term used for sites under the Regional Council of Latin America[[/footnote]] was built around SCP-ES-113. Facility-13 must act under the guise of Private School Sir Cantor Padrig, San Carlos de Palacios City[[footnote]]Autonomous and isolated city founded by the Foundation as a means of protection for high-value personnel from Facility-57, located on a high plateau in Gulf of Penas, Chile. It is outfitted with an antimemetic Garlés-Petrocchi dome, Scranton Reality Anchors concealed in the foundations of each house, copies of SCP-ES-███ (&#34;Upgraded Trees&#34;) in the parks to maintain a healthy oxygen level, a nuclear power plant, and a Way within it leading to an armed checkpoint within Facility-57. Other details have been omitted for brevity. Despite the high presence of anomalous technology and Foundation personnel, the Veil remains intact and the existence of the city is kept under the guise of housing for power plant workers. [[/footnote]], Chile, with researchers and security personnel under fictitious identities as professors, inspectors, and janitors. Administrative personnel within the Facility must also complete the school&#39;s administrative functions.

The entirety of students attending Facility-13 must have families with a minimum of two members working within the Foundation. The number of female students must always remain above the number of male students.

SCP-ES-113 is currently behind the door of one of the women&#39;s bathrooms in Facility-13. It must remain constantly closed while tests are not being performed. Once a day, at least one 13-year-old D-Class subject must interact with SCP-ES-113. Given the lack of D-Class subjects fulfilling this requirement, their long-term use and protection against monthly termination is granted under the &#39;D Parenting&#34; Program.

In case of a containment breach, MTF Ny-13 (&#34;Cult of 13&#34;), are to locate SCP-ES-113&#39;s new position and establish a perimeter around it. Immediately after, a new Facility-13 must be built and the prior one dismantled, under the facade of bankruptcy.

Before year 3013, MTF Ni-13 (&#34;Triscaidecaphobia&#34;) must be deployed to neutralize the anomaly under the &#34;Scranton Ambush&#34; Protocol.

[[include component:image-block name=http://lafundacionscp.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-es-113/ANG-L-2.jpg|caption=SCP-ES-113]]

**Description:** SCP-ES-113 is a crude drawing of what is assumed to be a caricature of an unidentified creature possessing animal traits.

SCP-ES-113 can be easily erased, as with any graphite pencil drawing. Once erased, it&#39;ll reappear in the closest primary school, manifesting within a bathroom corresponding to the most represented gender of students within the school. SCP-ES-113 will also demanifest if an exchange is not performed in a period longer than 26 hours.

Once a subject between 5 and 13 years of age is alone in its bathroom, SCP-ES-113 will animate and begin vocalizing, usually saying &#34;I&#39;m offering you a special deal,&#34; or similar phrases, in a slow, shrill voice. Invariably, subjects hearing the phrase will feel a strong compulsion to move towards the source of the sound, where SCP-ES-113 will attempt to convince the subject to &#39;give something they desire in exchange for something they love the same amount[[footnote]]This has shown to be highly ambiguous, with subjects receiving or &#39;giving&#39; something they originally did not want to, but in the majority of cases feeling the exchange was, objectively, fair. More tests pending.[[/footnote]]&#39;. If a subject rejects an exchange, SCP-ES-113 will remain silent and immobile for several seconds, after which the subject begins to feel a growing compulsion to accept the anomaly&#39;s deal. Should the exchange not be accepted within 13 seconds, SCP-ES-113 will express sadness and become inanimate.

In 13.13% of cases, SCP-ES-113 will state that the subject &#39;does not desire or appreciate anything enough&#39;, which will then result in the heart of the affected individual (Subject A) being spontaneously and cleanly cut, then teleported centimeters away from the living being they had the most contact with (Subject B). The heart of Subject B is similarly teleported centimeters away from Subject A.

SCP-ES-113 was initially discovered in the door of a bathroom in ███ █████ School, ███████, Chile, shortly after Incident ES-113-1 took place. After the incident came to Foundation knowledge through agents embedded in the local police, the door containing SCP-ES-113 was taken to a Standard Cell in Facility-12 for initial containment. However, upon arriving at the Facility, SCP-ES-113 disappeared. Two years later, it was discovered again in ███ ████████ School in ████████, Chile, after a child exited the bathroom holding a PlayStation 2® and his room and the kitchen disappeared from his house, approximately at the same time, with markings suggesting both were ripped from the ground. Witnesses were administered amnestics and the cover story of a gas explosion was planted.

**Incident ES-113-1:** On 28/4/2000, during a school recess, approximately at 13:22, a 13-year-old child was found dead in the men&#39;s bathroom, covered in gore and bloodied body tissue. An investigation by local police identified the child as Marcelo Astorga, with the biological material he was covered with belonging to Angélica Aguilera, without a third party at the scene nor possible nearby tools to perform this action. Given these strange occurrences, Foundation agents embedded in local police took the case and reported to the scene, where agents rediscovered the anomalous nature of SCP-ES-113 after testing in the scene with pocket Scranton Reality Anchors. Background research revealed Marco &#39;loved Angélica with all his being&#39;. Facility-13 (2000-2013) was established 13 days after.

&gt; **Results:** D-10238 did not exit the bathroom. After 3 minutes of waiting, a researcher entered to locate him. When found, he was discovered deceased in a similar fashion to the victim of Incident ES-113-1, but covered in bones and flesh in decomposition. A background investigation revealed the bones and flesh belonged to his mother, who had been murdered by the twins.
&gt; **Notes:** //Despite the low ratio of twin D-Class we possess, I believe this proves we have to be more cautious at the time of choosing who to send for testing. D-10238 was not in the least apt for a test with such high cooperation requirements as this one// -- Dr. Sterlab

Impedes hair growth, voice deepening, and keeps the skin soft. Under observation as a possible uncontained anomaly.[[/footnote]] 
&gt; **Premeditated Desire:** Be an astronaut.
&gt; **Resultados:** D-9732 did not leave the bathroom for 7 minutes. After this time, a guard entered to locate him. D-9732 was nowhere to be found, and nothing had disappeared from his room. Before the results could be sent to Research Leader Dr. Sterlab, he was declared as disappeared. Security cameras in his office revealed that he disappeared at the same time Test 91 was being realized. After two months of unsuccessful search by the Foundation&#39;s [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-179 Orbital Composition of Unified Solar Study], both were declared dead. A background investigation showed that D-9732 felt great admiration for Dr. Sterlab and his work.
&gt; **Notes:** //That&#39;s enough. These tests keep better showing how ES-113 works, but at the same time, they do nothing but kill us. Leader Sterlab was the last one left, and now I don&#39;t have anyone. I solicit an immediate halting of all ES-113 testing.// -- Dr. Marin Sterlab

&gt; **Results:**  D-16015 died shortly after beginning the test. A day after, an average of 78% of the world population became aware of the name &#39;Isaac Newton&#39;, relating it to science and repeatedly stating he was an important person for it and with great impact to modern life. Use of SCP-ES-███ was ineffective at removing these memories. To repair ensuing consensus damage, use of SCP-ES-████ to insert memories about Isaac Newton&#39;s life (For further information, click [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton here]).

**Subject:** Dr. Marin Sterlab
**Premeditated Desire:** Unknown
**Note:** This test was conducted without authorization. Dr. Marin Sterlab burst in Facility-13 during the Christmas party of 2013. It is believed that negligence from SCP-ES-113&#39;s night shift guards allowed Dr. Marin Sterlab access without impediment.
**Results:** A thaumaturgical temporal regression [[footnote]]From the Foundation&#39;s Senior Detective Guide, Page 13, //&#34;Making use of the services of a qualified temporal thaumaturge, it is possible to return photons and soundwaves to form a scene. The final result will be a kind of &#39;hologram&#39; of what once happened there, although with quite some grain in the image. It&#39;s worth highlighting how far back this can go depending on the capacity of the thaumaturge in question.  This is a method, that, if one is lucky, they will never have to use. The Foundation only allows it during catastrophes.&#34;// The Foundation&#39;s Senior Detective Guide is available for free for all members of the Anomalous Crime Research Department.[[/footnote]] in SCP-ES-113&#39;s chamber revealed Dr. Marin Sterlab managed to successfully communicate with SCP-ES-113, this being the first documented case of an adult communicating with the anomaly. SCP-ES-113 claimed it was expecting him, and that he would fulfill his desire. Dr. Marin Sterlab repeatedly thanked the entity before vanishing. Seconds after, Facility-13 (2000-2013) disappeared along SCP-ES-113. SCP-ES-113 was later found and a new Facility-13 (2013-Present) was erected.

&gt; 
&gt; **D-10237:** It&#39;s good that you want to talk now, mister drawing.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ES-113:** Hehe. This mister drawing likes being reserved, kid. Being reserved and rewarding those that make effort in accomplishing things. Hehe.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-10237:** Then, would you wait for me to write all you say
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ES-113:** Yes, child. You&#39;ve got all my time. I won&#39;t go anywhere, hehe.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-10237:** Thanks, mister drawing. The Foundation told me to ask what you are.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ES-113:** Me? I&#39;m just me, child. What you see is me. What they see is me. I&#39;m just that. It&#39;s me. Hehe.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-10237:** The Foundation told me to ask again if you said weird things.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ES-113:** I&#39;m SCP-ES-113, a crude drawing of what is assumed to be a caricature of an unidentified creature of animal traits. Or that&#39;s what they think, hehe. They judge me without knowing me, hehe. You never do that, child, that&#39;s wrong.

&gt; **D-10237:** Then, what are you, sir?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ES-113:** I like how polite you are, child, hehe. Kids like you are needed in this world, child. I&#39;m a **{{[COGNITOHAZARD REDACTED]}}**, the 13th of them.

&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ES-113:** Because it&#39;s what I want to do, child. Give the kids what they deserve. Hope that all dreams can come true, regardless of anything. Reward them for being the angels they are.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-10237:** That&#39;s very kind, sir. But then, why did you do that to the other kids that loved each other a lot?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ES-113:** Because that&#39;s what Marcelo wanted, child. I gave Marcelo what he deserved. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-10237:** But I think you hurt him, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ES-113:** Child, I know what I did. Marcelo is happy. Next question.

&gt; **SCP-ES-113:** No. I didn&#39;t kill anyone. No one died. I&#39;m no murderer. I give children what they want. Only that. Only. That. Kids make wishes, I fulfill them. Because I&#39;m a good person. A good person that does good things. Killing is not something we good people do. I don&#39;t kill. I DON&#39;T KILL!
&gt; 
&gt; **D-10237:** Sir, you&#39;re scaring me.
&gt; 
&gt; //In this part the sir went silent.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Sir is still silent, looking at me.//
&gt; 
&gt; //I feel like my mouth had ants walking in it.//
&gt; 
&gt; //I can&#39;t move my head or legs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ES-113:** What did you say, child? What did you wish for?
&gt; 
&gt; //My mouth moves on its own, I&#39;m scared.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-ES-113:** &#34;I want all of those real murderers in the Foundation to die forever.&#34; Oh, yes, child, your wish is very good. There is nothing more pure than wishing that all corruption in the world disappears. Of course I&#39;ll fulfill that. I&#39;ll only need a little time to be able to make it true. It doesn&#39;t look like it, but I&#39;m old and things are hard for me, hehe.
&gt; 
&gt; //Hello, Foundation, it&#39;s me, hehe. Your child wished a very sweet wish that I&#39;ll of course make true. But I&#39;m not like you, nor do I like surprises. I&#39;ll take a long time. The last great organization took me 100,000 years of sleep. But I&#39;ve seen what you do to my brothers, and you inspire me a lot. I give you 1,000 years.//
&gt; 
&gt; //I&#39;d tell you to greet the kid in heaven, but you don&#39;t get to go there.//

&gt; **End Note:** //When D-10237 exited, he claimed not remembering anything prior to the first cognitohazard. It is unknown if SCP-ES-113&#39;s capabilities could destroy the Foundation in its entirety. But I wouldn&#39;t want to find out. I propose the immediate termination of SCP-ES-113. We&#39;ve seen what it is capable of, and I don&#39;t want to see any more of this. I don&#39;t want any more people to die.// -- Dr. Marin Sterlab
