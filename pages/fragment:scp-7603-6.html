+ Babalon&#39;s Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe
++ (Morningstar&#39;s favorite)


[[f&gt;image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7603/Babalon_sigil.png style=&#34;width: 200px;&#34;]]
I owe much to my half-brother, Morningstar. After an especially hard day of work and law school, the two of us would be wiped out, exhausted, and likely covered in blood. I remembered that Morningstar loves chocolate chip cookies, so I dug through my mother&#39;s cookbooks and found my mother&#39;s recipe for protein-packed chocolate chip cookies.

We tried it, and found it very delicious. While demons and angels do not need to eat, protein is still vital in muscle development and regeneration from lost tissue. These provide three sources of protein, and only have a total of seven ingredients. Morningstar and I can not get enough of them. We often pack these cookies on our more dangerous missions, and as a treat for our workouts.

We hope you enjoy them as much as we do.

++ Preference Notes:

**Adrian** likes a bit extra salt. Extra ½ teaspoon.

**Astia** likes hers coated in jimmies.

**Morningstar** loves all variants, but adding additional chocolate chips is popular with him. He also enjoys them with ketchup for some reason, but that has no impact on how the cookies themselves are baked.

I, **Primrose,** prefer a hint of cinnamon. 1 teaspoon.</textarea></pre>
