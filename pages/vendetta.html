I have gotten my revenge.

Ever since I&#39;d been knocked from the highest cliff in the land, and left for dead on the cold, tile ground. But that wasn&#39;t my end. I&#39;d not shattered on the ground, but bounced, preserving my life and igniting a hunger for revenge.

But, I am getting ahead of myself. I am Swolly Bodget, first order of the Steinberger family. We are a noble, semi-transparent people, who live in the great land of the Baer Family China Cabinet. Our family is of noble stature, taking high positions on the third and topmost shelf. We look down upon the silver spoons, wax sculptures, and various doodads and gee-haws. Of course, we have our detractors, in particular a competing noble family.

The Wineglassbergensteins occupy the shelf below us, and covet our precious top shelf spot. We, of course, held the top spot because of our complete status. Every one of our original components was intact, and we shimmered under the low glow of fluorescent lighting. The Wineglassbergensteins, on the other hand, had the misfortune of losing their second smallest tea tray. 

Ever thirsting for power, the Wineglassbergensteins hatched a plot to end our reign. Their second largest teacup, known colloquially as &#34;Ervin&#34;, hatched a plan to get the top spot by smashing one of our family members. But who, they asked, would be best for the task? They pondered, and piddered, they even went as far as pedaling, and eventually they decided on their target: Me. The smallest teacup in the family would be like taking a spoon from a wax baby hand.

So, when the lights were turned off, they seized me from my velvet-lined collectors edition bed, and hoisted me to the very top of the cabinet. I pleaded with them, telling them that the scuffs on their finishing work would disallow them entry to the coveted top space. But my pleas fell on deaf handles. They cast me from on high, down, down to the unforgiving earth. But I did not shatter. I bounced, and as I did, I swore revenge.

The next morning, I was replaced in my casing, unscuffed and filled with shattering rage. These unpolished gangers were no better than common Dixie cups! They would suffer like one too. I plotted for many nights, with my associates Billy the teaspoon and Reginald T. Sugarcubeholder. We decided that for their crimes, the whole family of Wineglassbergenstein would suffer our wrath. They would look up, and cry, &#34;what light, through yonder Solo breaks?&#34; 

We stealthily hopped to their home in the last night of the week, and began our glorious master revenge plan of infinite justice and destruction. We snuck into their camp, and loosened every screw on the wooden platform which held them aloft. Then, in the lower, urban, knickknack wasteland that was the bottom shelf, we threw this pamphlet down.

&gt; +++ PEOPLE OF THE LOWER SHELF
&gt; 
&gt; WE, THE LOVING AND KIND WINEGLASSBERGENSTEIN FAMILY, HAVE CREATED A FUN ACTIVITY GATHERING FOR ALL WALKS OF DOODAD! JOIN THE FINEST OF CHINA, AS WE CELEBRATE UNITY AND HOW COOL WE ARE
&gt; 
&gt; CAKE AND PUNCH WILL BE SERVED FROM US

From here, we waited. When daylight broke, the low waking sounds of the bottom tier were swiftly replaced with excited squeals. There was a stampede of trinkets and thingamajiggers rushing up to the second floor, eager for spoils. Confused, the foolhardy Wineglassbergensteins were overwhelmed by the sheer number of doohickeys storming their gates.

There was a creaking

Then silence.

A great, calamitous sound rang out, crashing, splintering and shattering alike. 

Silence reigned again.

Since then, there hasn&#39;t been a sound from what used to be the lower floors. We have gotten our revenge, and remain the ruling set of the cabinet. All those who would oppose us, and those we ruled, have been smashed to smithereens. There are those among our camp who think that they all deserved it, and our survival was predetermined. Others say that we acted with too much haste, and lost everything that gave us power.

But, in the coming months, things would indeed change. New shelves were installed, new trinkets and antiques placed upon them. They were cold, unconversational types, who never spoke or moved. We pine for the days before, when we could have rivalries and fights, some excitement. But none of that is here, and really, did we ever have any power? The things we presided over were no great feats. This was merely a return to what should have been all along.

In the end, we were only cups.</textarea></pre>
