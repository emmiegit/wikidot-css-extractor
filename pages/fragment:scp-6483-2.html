[[include component:image-block name=dude.jpg|align=right|width=45%|caption=VNP-6483, following slight ontokinetic self-modifications.]]

**Specifications:** Nicolas Roberts, a 70-year-old human member of Mobile Task Force Theta-9 (&#34;The Polar Express&#34;), measuring 179 cm in height and 104 kilograms in weight. Possesses Class III reality-bending abilities. Per his Vanguard employment and housing agreement, he is only allowed to use ontokinetic abilities during Theta-9 missions,[[footnote]] Refer to Addendum 6483-1 for more details. [[/footnote]] disguising visual indicators of fully-realized Class III or above reality benders [[footnote]] E.g. purple eyes.[[/footnote]] during civilian interactions, or emergency circumstances until such a time that ontokinesis has been fully integrated into baseline society.

**Normalization Protocols:** Roberts will provide a benign introduction to the public of the abilities and limitations of reality-warpers. His strong self-identification with the persona of Santa Claus will promote widespread acceptance of ontokinetic abilities. Furthermore, his role as a cultural liaison will aid in the normalization of VNP-1483.

Roberts has significant experience playing the character of Santa Claus, a figure strongly associated with non-religious observations of Christmas. He has agreed to feature in Vanguard Christmas video productions, in which he will use his ontokinetic abilities to perform Nativitatis Events. This controlled application of reality-warping will demonstrate to the public that ontokinetic individuals can be safe, sane, and natural. The association with Santa Claus will reinforce the image of reality-bending as not inherently malevolent.

Roberts will serve in a public-facing role within MTF Theta-9. He will be tasked with conveying cultural nuances about Christmas to representatives of the Third Antarctic Empire, and will in turn be responsible for participating in Empire holiday celebrations to further develop the cultural exchange. As a cultural liaison, Roberts will be permitted to perform Nativitatis Events year-round.

Roberts will feature in Vanguard video productions as Santa Claus, describing holidays celebrated within the Empire, as part of normalization procedures for the Third Antarctic Empire. Furthermore, due to preexisting cultural associations between the character of Santa Claus and nonhuman sentient beings dwelling at Earth&#39;s poles, Santa Claus is an ideal candidate for normalizing the existence of human subspecies.

Nicolas Roberts is no longer considered an anomaly under Foundation jurisdiction. He is employed under standard Vanguard job contracts for Normalized Personnel. His normalization consists of employment with Theta-9, with unanimous recommendation from the Site-322 and Site-120 Classification Committees.

**Additional Information:** Summary of VNP-1483

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Excerpt from VNP-1483**

**Specifications:** [[[SCP-1483 |VNP-1483]]] is an alternate version of the continent of Antarctica. It is currently ruled by the Third Antarctic Empire, a matriarchal imperialist monarchy. The technology level of VNP-1483 is roughly equivalent to that of baseline&#39;s late 20th century. However, mass media capabilities are limited, and most visual records of Third Empire culture are in the form of films or photographs. Computing technology and VNP-1483&#39;s equivalent of the internet are primitive.

The dominant species inhabiting VNP-1483 is //Homo antarcticus,// which is divided into subspecies. The majority of //Homo antarcticus// are visually similar to baseline humanity. However, //Homo antarcticus// also includes &#34;The Black Court&#34;, a subspecies with thick layers of body fat and fur, &#34;Menders&#34;, a clerical subspecies with an additional pair of arms and a metal exoskeleton, and &#34;Watchers-Upon-All&#34;, a subspecies that stands 2.5 meters tall, has six arms, and all-black eyes.

**Normalization Protocols:** The dominant normalcy preservation organization in VNP-1483 is the Imperial Institute of Paranatural and Esoteric Study (IIPES). The IIPES was not strongly affected by a local Impasse, as its philosophy has always included preparing the public for interaction with the anomalous. The policies of IIPES will be reviewed to determine if any are appropriate for Vanguard adoption.

Following the resolution of the Impasse, passage to VNP-1483 was restored. VNP-1483 is a member of the inaugural class of parallel worlds to be revealed to the public. VNP-1483 was selected due to existing friendly diplomatic relations with the Third Antarctic Empire.

The goals of the normalization of VNP-1483 include:
* Increasing the public&#39;s awareness of the existence and nature of parallel realities and the multiversal nexus;
* Increasing the public&#39;s awareness of additional human subspecies;
* Increasing the level of cultural exchange between our reality and VNP-1483;
* Extending the [[[antarctic-exchange-hub|Antarctic Exchange]]] program to civilian researchers.

**Designation and Name:** Mobile Task Force Theta-9 (&#34;The Polar Express&#34;)

**Team Members:** Lauren Burns (Area-179), Leon Holloway (Site-19), Timothy Rainer (Site-120), Cory Chapman (Site-322), Nicolas Roberts (VNP-6483; Site-1483)

**Objectives:**
# Escort vital Vanguard political figures towards Site-1483 via the usage of VNP-6483&#39;s teleportation capabilities to and from the entry to Universe B-10208-Alpha-1483 located in the Queen Alexandra Mountain range.
# Transport of Third Empire personnel as part of the Antarctic Exchange.[[footnote]] A Vanguard program, focused on exchanging knowledge and personnel with the Third Empire. [[/footnote]] Performance of Nativitatis Events within the Empire.[[footnote]] For further information, refer to VNP-1483 Normalization Statement. [[/footnote]]
# Aid the normalization of VNP-1483 on baseline Earth.

**History:** The following is the full timeline of all events leading up to Theta-9&#39;s reestablishment.

* 10/09/2021 -- [[[SCP-6500|The Impasse]]][[footnote]] A worldwide event causing the end of magic and anomalous activity, caused by the actions of the SCP Foundation. [[/footnote]] begins, relieving VNP-6483 of his anomalous properties; his depression increases. Due to the universal decrease in anomalous activity, the entry to Universe B-10208-Alpha-1483 is lost, leading to total accidental dissolution of the highly valuable Foundation-Third Empire alliance. MTF Theta-9 is dissolved.
* 24/11/2021 -- The Impasse is temporarily held off in the areas of FP-120 (&#39;&#39;[[[esterberg-city-wikipedia|Esterberg]]]&#34;) due to the actions of &#34;[[[jaeger-part-2|Nobody]]].&#34;  Shortly after, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/SCP-6500/offset/11 an O5 vote forms Vanguard] and [[[hour-zero|drops the Veil of Normalcy]]], effectively starting the dissolution of the SCP Foundation. VNP-6483 regains his abilities, which significantly improves his mental state. Access to the Third Empire is restored.
* 15/02/2022 -- VNP-1483 is inaugurated into the first class of alternate planes for Normalization. Dr. Jessie Rivera recommends Nicolas Roberts as a possible member of diplomatic staff. The recommendation is initially denied.
* 24/12/2022 -- A review of the Third Empire&#39;s culture under newly-instated Vanguard Normalization Protocols identifies a significant vector for positive cultural exchange.[[footnote]] For further information, refer to VNP-1483 Normalization Statement.[[/footnote]]
*  25/12/2022 -- MTF Theta-9 is officially reformed; Roberts is promoted to a diplomatic role within Vanguard.

**VNP-1483 Normalization Document:** Transcript of VNP-1483/VNP-6483 Normalization Video

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
The following is the transcript of an educational video produced in conjunction by MTF-Theta 9 and the Imperial Institute of Paranatural and Esoteric Study. The first half of the video will serve as a dramatization of a holiday ritual, filmed on-location. The second half will provide an educational lecture.

I&#39;d like to extend a thanks to Nicolas Roberts and Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin for their participation, and to the Third Antarctic Empire for embracing a new era of cooperation.

Merry Christmas, friends, from one side of [[[SCP-6172|the Multiversal Compass]]] to the other.

**Dramatis Personae:**

* **Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin:** Mender of the Third Antarctic Empire. Approximately 2 meters tall and has 4 arms. Responsible for local observation of the Breaking of the Night, an empire-wide celebration celebrating the end of winter and the return of the sun. Played by herself.

* **Santa Claus:** A being responsible for delivering presents to children on Christmas. Played by Nicolas Roberts. 

Dialogue in the video is in Antarctican, though there are English subtitles.

**Transcript:**

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

//Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin stands at a temple doorway, clasping her four arms together. The temple is adorned with traditional Antarctican furnishings, ornate carvings, and tapestries popping with bright reds and rich blues.//

//Snowflakes lightly fall from the sky. She is the only one on the surface; in this month of the year, most Antarcticans dwell underground.//

//She looks to the sky; the sound of sleigh bells echoes from the sky.//

//A red sleigh pulls up before her, drawn by nine reindeer. The animal at the front has a glowing red nose. Santa Claus sits in the sleigh.//

**Santa:** Ho ho ho! A very merry Christmas to you, Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin!

**Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin:** Greetings, Santa Claus, he-Empress of the North Pole, Commander of Elves and Reindeer. I welcome you in the name of Empress Utmai Cjen VI, First Beneath the Sun, Upon the Throne of Bones.

**Santa:** Ho ho ho! Much obliged! May I call you Clarizan?

**Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin:** No.

**Santa:** Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin, I will give your lineage the honor it deserves, or my name isn&#39;t Saint Nick! Ho ho ho! 

**Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin:** Isn&#39;t your name Santa Claus?

**Santa:** I have many names! Ho ho ho! But you may call me whichever ones suit your fancy. Now, join me in my sleigh?

//Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin joins Santa Claus in his sleigh. She is much taller than him.//

**Santa:** Where to, holy Mender?

//Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin points at a tall mountain on the horizon.//

**Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin:** To the place where dawn meets the land, and the sun returns from the long winter.

**Santa:** Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen! Let&#39;s be off!

//Santa cracks his reins. His sled starts to fly. He looks at the camera.//

**Santa:** Tonight, Mender Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin and I will be sharing some of our holiday traditions with each other. I will be sharing with her the joys of Christmas, and she will Break the Night. Oh, great and holy servant of the Empress, perhaps you can tell us of the significance of the Breaking of the Dawn?

**Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin:** The Breaking of the Night is a yearly celebration, in which we hail the return of the sun from the Blighted Lands. In each of the seventeen provinces, it falls to a mender to perform a Blessing upon the highest peak, to welcome the sun back from her journeys through darkness. In this province, the duty falls to this humble servant of the empire.

**Santa:** Ho ho ho! I can see that you deserve to be on the Nice List! 

**Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin:** I hope that is a good thing. 

**Santa:** Well, the Nice List is where all the good children go, and the naughty list is where all the bad children go. On Christmas Eve, I bring the good children presents, and the bad children get no reward.

**Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin:** So you are a hand of justice, o mighty northern he-Empress.

**Santa:** I wouldn&#39;t say that! You see, when Christmas Eve rolls around… I find there&#39;s no such thing as a truly bad child.

//They arrive at the highest peak in the province. The camera pans over the Antarctic plains. The settlements below are covered in a thick layer of snowfall; neither Santa nor Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin are affected by the cold. There are shadows moving through the ice plains below -- carnivorous penguins, migrated to civilization for the winter.//

**Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin:** I shall now perform the Blessings of the Awaited Dawn.

//Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin closes her eyes. She extends her four arms, reaching towards the sky, pulling light from heaven to earth. A sun disc forms behind her head, growing to a width of twenty meters in diameter.//

//Golden light dances across the snow-covered plains. The carnivorous penguins balk at the light; they start waddling towards the wilderness.//

//Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin opens her eyes. They glow yellow, though it slowly fades.//

**Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin:** With this, I welcome the sun&#39;s safe return. 

//Santa extends his hand to Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin. They return to the sleigh and take flight.//

**Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin:** When the dawn eventually comes, hunters shall emerge upon the plains, and slaughter any beasts that yet remain. This is the sun&#39;s yearly gift to us. 

**Santa:** But aren&#39;t you hungry //now?//

**Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin:** I suppose so…

**Santa:** Ho ho ho! In that case, my friend, let me treat you to a Christmas dinner!

//Jump cut to the temple. Santa and Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin stand at opposite ends of a table.//

**Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin:** For a guest as esteemed as the he-Empress of the North, the Empress would allow the finest delicacies, the most celebrated choirs. Yet you are so gracious as to bring your own.

**Santa:** We all have our talents. Ho ho ho!

//Santa snaps his fingers. A red tablecloth appears upon the table. A stuffed roast megapenguin, sweet moss sauce, and other Antarctican delicacies materialize. A Christmas carol played on traditional Antarctican instruments is in the background. The two grab utensils and serve themselves.//

**Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin:** Yet I feel our cultural exchange has been uneven. I have shown you the Blessing of the Awaited Dawn, and the Breaking of the Night. What, Santa, is the true meaning of Christmas?

//Santa smiles mysteriously. His eyes twinkle. The music rises.//

//There is a jump cut and a video tour of various holiday celebrations across the Third Antarctic Empire and Christmas celebrations at various Foundation sites,  including Area-179, Site-43, Site-87, Site-120, and Site-322, over a mix of Christmas tunes. When the tour completes, the video returns to Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin and Nicolas Roberts sitting side-by-side, facing the camera.//

**Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin:** Thank you for watching this educational film on the Breaking of the Dawn and Christmas. We hope you enjoyed our performance. I am Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin, and this is my co-star, Nicolas Roberts.

**Roberts:** It was a pleasure working with you, Clarizan.

**Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin:** The same to you, Nick. Now, I portrayed myself, but you, Nick, are clearly Blessed with power, but are you Santa Claus?

**Roberts:** Ha! The truth is, Clarizan, I&#39;ve been playing the role of Santa Claus for many years, and I&#39;d like to say I&#39;m //like// Santa Claus each and every day, but I&#39;m not the mythical he-Empress of the North. Even so, I try every day to embody the spirit of Christmas.

**Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin:** For those who are not Menders, who do not have Blessings like yours, what does it mean to embody Christmas? 

**Roberts:** That&#39;s quite the question. On my earth, Christmas is a thousand holidays celebrated as one, each meaning something different to everyone who celebrates it. There are elements of the Roman Saturnalia, the Norse Yule, and of course the Christian faith. It&#39;s celebrated across the world, from Chile to Japan, a little differently in every country. But in my heart, there&#39;s one thing that&#39;s most important of all.

**Clarizan Jhulaen Sheldarren Tarannaemin:** And what might that be?

**Roberts:** Generosity. Giving. Thinking of your fellow man or woman and extending a hand to them. Just like how you Break the Night, in service of the Empress and the Empire, being Santa is about bringing joy to those around you. Because at the end of the day, Christmas isn&#39;t about making yourself happy or the gifts you receive, but how you can touch the lives of others, and give them just a taste of magic.
