**Special Containment Procedures:** It is mandatory that Foundation researchers involved in the here-mentioned studies not view any movie suspected of containing instances of SCP-[[$ \sqrt{-1} $]] -J in order to preserve clinical purity. The same researchers are to accept the existence of SCP-[[$ \sqrt{-1} $]] -J as axiomatic and ignore the naysayers. Inklings to hypothesize &#34;more likely&#34; reasons for the central question of this research project are to be resisted because the author desperately needs to publish something and quick, you guys.

In the event of never-before-approved, research-oriented screenings, testers of the study group are not to participate without cellophane lenses that are impregnated with tourmaline-based anaglyph technology and capable of antagonizing Aleph Meta level cognitoadverse effects. To protect further, and as a failsafe in the event of (1) an equipment malfunction or (2) the emergence of tourmaline-resistant instances, testers are to maintain 75% contraction of their orbicularis oculi muscles[[footnote]] Results in squinting. [[/footnote]] for the duration of the film(s). Electrodes may be placed to assist in the sustainment of said contractions.

Two research personnel per participating theater are to covertly crouch outside the cinematic premiers of movies fitting the likely habitat of SCP-[[$ \sqrt{-1} $]]-J, stenographing the content and calculating the concentration of both favorable and unfavorable criticisms as movie-goers leave the theater or venue. If approached with suspicion by any non-Foundation personnel, researchers are to immediately begin diversional maneuvers as outlined by Protocol SQRT—1.[[footnote]] &#34;If approached by a civilian or civilians, agents should maintain the guise of being homeless, preferably excusing themselves to micturate and/or defecate in any appropriately shaped receptacle or natural concavity, maintaining constant visualization with the civilian(s) until the post is safe to reapproach. Extended grunting has been correlated with increased efficacy. If successful production of stool is observed during such a manuever, the guise of vagrancy is to be discontinued and proper hygiene is to be performed. Conversely, if approached by a constabulary authority, agents should begin proselytizing abstruse esoterics of whichever hobby is most familiar to them. 

These diversional maneuvers are intended to counterbalance any suspicion with disinterest and/or disgust in lieu of the Foundation not supporting any other proposed countermeasures, or the funding thereof.&#34;[[/footnote]]

**Description^^-1^^:**[[footnote]]The following were theses posed by the author throughout his --career-- tenancy, but were rejected by senior leadership because each has already been researched extensively, some to the limit of their usefulness. They are included here because the author believes he independently anticipated their scientific fertility, and that is something.[[/footnote]] SCP-[[$ \sqrt{-1} $]]-J is //not//: 
* a 3-part spatial anomaly in an abandoned mobile juice bar that can convert any nipple into an industry-quality juicer. 
* a VHS cassette depicting a puppet that hesitantly admonishes you to rewind the tape and makes your finger inexhaustibly itchy until you press &#34;Play&#34;.
* a pack of crayons that are anomalously incapable of coloring but may or may not begin sleeping when flirted with. 
* a cummerbund which when worn grants the adorner the ability to whisper in any language when less than 5 inches from another&#39;s ear.
* a fucking plush toy for God&#39;s sake that gives adultery-inspiring massages that are isolated to the philtrum.
* a BE-Class-Migration-End-of-Consciousness-Scenario-worthy ounce of dietary fiber.
* about bees.
* a compulsion-impinging didgeridoo that can only be resisted at close proximity when twerking to Top-20 hits.
* a 50 year old Caucasian male who anomalously enjoys pulling up his socks on his calves and who can be heard saying &#34;C&#39;mon, who likes slouchy socks?&#34; each time he does.
* a series of obtuse ritual motions that cause //all// one&#39;s body hair to be curly and lush but that also increases the risk of being poached in proportion to the gravity-defying volume evoked.
* a rampant archival phenomenon whereby the surnames of individuals in official documentation are replaced by their childhood nicknames.
* an infectious telephone call which spontaneously answers on recipients&#39; phones and adds them to a Guinness Book of World Records campaign for the largest teleconference involuntarily assembled.

**Description:** No, SCP-[[$ \sqrt{-1} $]] -J is a theoretical Aleph-Class audiovisual cognitohazard, postulated by the up-and-coming, so-hot-right-now Dr. Walton Matthus Banks, Ph.D. to explain wholly or in part the financial success and continuation of unfavorably-reviewed installments [[footnote]] Per aggregate scores such as Rotten Tomatoes.[[/footnote]] in modern movie franchises. Foundation investigation arose after wondering how a previous Lead Researcher became exceedingly wealthy.

I wonder if he was even looking, or maybe he was missing his glasses? Maybe my rear instills an anomalous effect in electronic devices?? I will review this footage more thoroughly later and report. He denied my request to have a sample processed is his home lab for diagnostics (he apparently doesn&#39;t have a home lab, oddly enough), but was very accommodating otherwise and I would recommend him to anyone, especially my peers.//

Upon witnessing SCP-[[$ \sqrt{-1} $]] -J, and with increasing enthusiasm after each exposure, individuals will be willing or inclined to see a proposed next installment in a franchise or series. Additionally, individuals with a Psychic Resistance Scale score of ≤ 65 will respond with critical enthusiasm to the film employing descriptors such as &#34;well done&#34;, &#34;awesome&#34;, &#34;really //really// good&#34;, and in the case of sequels, &#34;even better than the last one,” regardless of the installment&#39;s content. Foundation anomalosensitive modeling predicts that the severity of SCP-[[$ \sqrt{-1} $]] -J instances is to increase as a result of current 3D/IMAX film technology by orders of magnitude approximating 12 Michael Bays (or [[$ 0.\overline{9394} $]] Jerry Bruckheimers).[[footnote]]1 Michael Bay = 1 Kaiju-Class instantiation/film/year.[[/footnote]]^^,^^[[footnote]] These studies ignored the possibility that the growth may be exponential because it resulted in severe vasoconstriction of cerebral capillary beds of those researchers tasked with the calculation. This was suggested as a possible tertiary anomalous effect of SCP-[[$ \sqrt{-1} $]] -J and the task was aborted citing safety concerns.[[/footnote]]
 
While the author admits that it has not been proven //per se// that the implicated corporations possess the capacity to create SCP-[[$ \sqrt{-1} $]] -J, the likelihood of the observed outcome(s) with respect to the films&#39; ratings and earnings without the use of SCP-[[$ \sqrt{-1} $]]-J is [[$ \approx {1 \over 9.6e968}$]], rendering the assumption (1) essential with respect to the conceptual comprehension of the observed gross revenue numbers, and (2) pragmatically actionable as fact.

+++ Amnestic-Facilitated Interrogation: PoI [[$ \sqrt{-1} $]].

[[collapsible show=&#34;Level 4 Security Clearance Required&#34; hide=&#34;&#39;&#39;Sir, our credential locks are malfunctioning and currently release with just the simplest click of a mouse.&#39;&#39;&#34;]]

&gt; **Dr. B███s:** Alright Jimmy you little tit brie, the jib is up.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jacob:** Jesus calm down, he&#39;s a child and his name is Hiro.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI [[$ \sqrt{-1} $]]:** Can I go back to the Foundation Day Care?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. B███s:** Once you explain well enough why you were attempting to see //another Land Before Time// movie in there, son.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI [[$ \sqrt{-1} $]]:** Where is my dad?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. B███s:** Wise guy, eh? What if I pop you with some Class-Xs? Hmm?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI [[$ \sqrt{-1} $]]:** Like //X-Men//?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. B███s:** No these are classified pills that can selectively erase memories of our choosing. Look here boy.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI [[$ \sqrt{-1} $]]:** Are those Smarties? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. B███s:** They... are.
&gt; 
&gt; //(PoI [[$ \sqrt{-1} $]] eats the Class-X amnestics.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Jacob:** WHA-... What are you //doing?!?//
&gt; 
&gt;  **Dr. B███s:** What do you have to say for yourself now, Jimmy?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI [[$ \sqrt{-1} $]]:** Who is my dad?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. B███s:** Not so wise anymore are you? Tell me; would you like to go watch the new //Land Before Time// movie that&#39;s coming out?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI [[$ \sqrt{-1} $]]:** //(excited)// #4 is coming out?!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. B███s:** ... it&#39;s at #14 now. //(To Jacob)// Both the X&#39;s and the cognitohazard are stronger than I anticipated. Let&#39;s keep him for further interrogation.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jacob:** //What the hell man?!//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. B███s:** Hey kid, do you remember who you are?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI [[$ \sqrt{-1} $]]:** Umm... my name is Jimmy?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. B███s:** //(To Jacob)// See? It&#39;s fine. //(Back to --Hiro-- Jimmy)// So, do you want to work for us? Right now we&#39;re studying movies, so to speak. If you say yes, you can see all the //Land Before Time// movies that they make.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI [[$ \sqrt{-1} $]]:** Are you the //X-files//?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. B███s:** Uh no... but I guess at the same time, yes. 
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI [[$ \sqrt{-1} $]]:** Are you and doctor?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. B███s:** It&#39;s &#34;a&#34; doctor, kid. And well, my name contains both &#34;Dr.&#34; and &#34;Ph.D.&#34;, so...
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI [[$ \sqrt{-1} $]]:** Can I be and doctor?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. B███s:** //(To Jacob)// Are there anti-child labor regulations in the Foundation?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jacob:** I&#39;m calling Kerosara man.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. B███s:** Oh c&#39;mon his dad works with us and it&#39;s inevitable he will too one day... might as well be now and for me. We could call it an  &#34;youth internship&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI [[$ \sqrt{-1} $]]:** When is tomorrow?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. B███s:** Well, I think this is enough to get us an interview log, right? Welcome aboard son!
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI [[$ \sqrt{-1} $]]:** Dad?!
