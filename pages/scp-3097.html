**Item #:** SCP-3097

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3097 is contained in a standard anomalous item locker. Testing of SCP-3097 is to take place explicitly indoors as to avoid any significant damage its effects may cause to surrounding or distant locations. SCP-3097 is to be reduced to a manageable size before re-containment after testing.

All dogs used in the experimentation of SCP-3097 are to be selected from the Foundation&#39;s animal testing subject enclosure and to have been given strict obedience training. Instances are to be subdued with long-range tranquillizers in the unlikely event of refusing to obey staff.

**Description:** SCP-3097 is a common alder tree branch, kept at an approximate length of 60cm when contained. When thrown by a human subject, SCP-3097 will increase in size as it propels through the air until eventually landing. While in midair, SCP-3097 will continue to resize itself so that it remains the same size as it visually appeared when originally perceived from the thrower&#39;s foreground perspective; i.e. the closer SCP-3097 appears to the thrower, the larger it will grow the further the distance it travels; as such, the size of SCP-3097 will also decrease when thrown by someone towards themselves.

**Addendum 3097-1:** On 27/06/2016, it was discovered that the anomalous properties of SCP-3097 also affect any dog which attempts to chase after it when thrown. As of this date, several breeds of dog have been tested with SCP-3097, all of which have been affected. Dogs altered in size by SCP-3097 continue to function with no difficulties due to an apparent condition acquired from their alteration in size, bearing similarities to the [[[SCP-881 | &#34;Forbes effect&#34;]]]. Instances of dog do not experience any apparent physiological changes after significant growth or shrinking, other than visible confusion brought on by their alterations.

**Addendum 3097-2:** On 13/08/20██ a total of [REDACTED] dogs which experienced significant growth from the effects of SCP-3097 were able to breach containment due to several complications which occurred during testing. Re-containment of all escaped instances henceforth referred as SCP-3097-B (several species of Welsh corgi measuring up to ███ meters), is to be accomplished before further testing with other breeds of dog.

**Update:** As of 03/05/20██, a majority of SCP-3097-B instances have been re-contained. There are currently no feasible means of reverting instances back to a manageable size, due to their weight, size and the functionality of SCP-3097’s anomalous properties. The unmanageable size and cost of containing instances of SCP-3097-B have resulted in the suggestion for immediate neutralization of a majority of instances.

**Addendum 3097-3:** Recent consultations with the Foundation Ethics Committee has lead to an alternate proposal for managing the contained instances of SCP-3097-B. Due to maintenance requirements and significant fuel costs of several on-site construction vehicles, required for the transportation of critical building materials, and the trained obedience of SCP-3097-B instances, the use of instances as a more efficient and cost-effective alternative means of transportation has been approved for several sites.
