&gt; **Abstract:** Contact was lost with Site-19 on 2 February 2087, following the initiation of a Category 5 (“Catastrophic”) Containment Breach Lockdown. Amalgamate Task Force 4 (“Götterdämmerung”) was dispatched to detonate the on-site warheads and recover survivors, as per the Lifthrasir Protocol. 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt; BEGIN LOG &gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Status check. We all good?
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** Check.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** Yep.
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** Think so.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** Correct.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Right. Let&#39;s get this done quick – Nineteen isn’t going to be as friendly as usual. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** The morale of Site Nineteen staff is not relevant to this mission.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** Just open the damn door, Jarvis.
&gt; 
&gt; //ATF 4 enter Site-19 via a side-entrance connected to the site cafeteria. The cafeteria shows signs of use from prior to the lockdown initiation. Jarvis closes and re-engages the lock behind them.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** Great.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** What?
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** Spag’ and bol’. Every time there’s a chance for me to have spag’ and bol’, I’m busy with something.
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** Probability anomaly. They’re common nowadays.
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** What, do you have one?
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** I’ve had one for a long time.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** What is it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** Women.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** Incorrect. There are no records of Agent Wagner hosting any anomalous phenomena. Agent Lindow is also present.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Jarvis?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** Yes, Agent Sturluson.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Humour.
&gt; 
&gt; //ATF 4 exit the cafeteria and navigate toward the Site-19 research wing, via the staff quarters.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** The doors should be closed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** Containment breach lockdown procedures necessitates the manual closing and locking of all doorways to restrict movement of anomalous entities.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** Manual? Can’t the system close all the doors?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** Site-19 does not feature a remote door control network. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** It’s because of the digital anomalies stored here, like [[[SCP-2522 | twenty-five twenty-two]]] and fifty-six seventy-nine. Can’t risk them getting control.
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** Is it safe for Jarvis to be with us? Couldn’t he go full Hatbot on us?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** Incorrect. I have not interfaced with the Site-19 network and cannot be accessed without physical connection.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** If we destroyed Hatbot and Penny Royal, would it –
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** This door’s been forced.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** What?
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Wagner points to a doorway. The bulkhead door has been crumpled to one side. A corpse is visible several metres ahead.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** Her head is on backwards.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Wagner searches the corpse.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** Her neck has been broken.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** No shit. She got ID?
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** Donna Lystrae.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** Doctor Donna Lystrae catalogued as deceased.
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** Lets uh, get moving before we’re next.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Lets. We’ll go to item storage first.
&gt; 
&gt; //ATF 4 navigates toward Site-19’s item storage wing. All doors are open, or are crumpled aside to allow access. Multiple corpses of on-site personnel are encountered, with varying causes of death. Agent Byock is forced to stop after encountering a D-class fused with an interior wall. Despite signs of containment breaches, no uncontained anomalies are encountered.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** Hey, hold up. This door’s closed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** Isn’t this Shapey’s room?
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** Yes. Looks like this door has been damaged to stop it from opening.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** Understandable. Shapey probably didn’t want anything getting at him.
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** It’s been damaged from this side. Jarvis, can you open this door?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; //Jarvis forces the bulkhead to [https://web.archive.org/web/20170708022603/https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1831 SCP-1831]&#39;s containment chamber to open. A dismembered D-class is scattered across the room; it is otherwise empty.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** Guess Shapey decided to bolt instead.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** D-class is, uh… number six-eight-four-three-nine.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** SCP-1831 catalogued as uncontained. D-68439 catalogued as deceased.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Everyone knows what Shapey is, right?
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** Higher-dimensional construct, part of the Little Misters.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Right, and everyone knew he could just leave any time he wanted, and there’d be nothing we could do to stop him.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** That’s a good point.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** Query. What is the point?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Why would you stop Shapey from using the door, if you know he can just go around it? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** …
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** I think you broke him.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** Incorrect. I am fully functional.
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** Sure you are.
&gt; 
&gt; //ATF 4 navigate to the item storage wing. All containment chambers encountered en route have been damaged to prevent them from opening; all anomalies are accounted for.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** This must be the work of an – stand up would you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** Sorry. Nerves.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Its fine. This really should be a Hammer Down job. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** Why aren&#39;t they here?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Too understaffed, just like every other task force. Which ones are you four from?
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** Zeta Nine, Mole Rats.
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** Rho One, The Professors.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** Mobile Task Force Kappa-10 “Skynet.”
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** … Rho Nine, Technical Support.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** I’m sorry, what? You’re from tech support?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Lindow.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** Why the hell is he here? Why – have you even been in the field before?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Gamma five.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** What?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** I’m from Gamma Five. Red Herrings.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** Great. We’ve got a trained operative, a book head, a brick-headed robot, his pit crew, and we’re being led by a liar.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Watch it, Lindow.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** No. Why the fuck are you in charge? I’m the one –
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** Proximity alert!
&gt; 
&gt; //The door behind ATF 4 closes. An unseen force strikes it from the other side, indenting the door and preventing it from opening. ATF 4 run to the item storage wing, stopping upon arrival.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** Jarvis, what was it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** Unknown, mobile entity. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** Had it been following us this whole damn time?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** Unknown.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** Sounded like a machine gun – five seventy-seven?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** Possible. Data insufficient for confirmation.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** It’s nasty and fast, that’s all we need to know. Nineteen has internal sensors all over the place, right?
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** Yes. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Byock, will you be able to get into the sensor readings?
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** Well, yeah. Just need a terminal.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Right, and there should be one in the item containment wing.
&gt; 
&gt; //ATF 4 reach the item storage wing within three minutes. Four additional doors are closed and rendered inoperable during the time frame; the offending entity remains out of sight at all times.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** For a catastrophic containment breach, it’s rather – oh boy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Sweet easter. How many of them are there?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** Thirty-five casualties catalogued.
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** Fuck…
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Just find out if there’s anyone left. If there isn’t we’ll just hit the nukes and bolt. Wagner, what are you doing?
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** Some of the skips stored here could be useful assets. I’m seeing what is supposed to be stored here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** Leave them alone. They’re in containment, and the place is getting nuked for a reason. Or did you forget the whole reason we’re here? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** To destroy all of the dangerous skips, yes. But the ones here in storage are mundane, if not beneficial. Example, [[[SCP-109 | one-oh-nine]]]; a bottle that provides and endless supply of beneficial… It’s gone.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** SCP-109 catalogued as uncontained.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** It might’ve been in testing when the breach happened. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** A shame. It would have been useful.
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** I’m in.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Is there anyone else other than us?
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** One.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** Fuck.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Just one? Are you sure?
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** As sure as the system is; one human-shaped warmth spot that’s moving around.
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** Do you know who it is?
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** No way of knowing. Could be a D-class, could be the site director – we have to check to find out.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** Screw them. We set the nuke up, and we get the hell out of here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** You&#39;re joking.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** No I&#39;m not, screen boy. We&#39;re only supposed to rescue if we&#39;re able.
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** There is no reason we cannot recover them. We are not constrained to any time limits, nor have we suffered any injuries. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** We get the survivor, then we rig the nuke.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** And what if we don&#39;t make it to the nuke, hmm? Fat lot of good saving one shmuck will do us when stuff like ninety-five seventy-three is running around because nobody blew it up first.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** Agent Lindow is correct. Nuclear detonation is the primary objective of this mission, and must be ensured.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** Thank you, Jarvis.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Jarvis, do you know how to start the countdown?
&gt; 
&gt; **Jarvis:** Correct.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Fine then. You and Lindow can go set up the nuke — set it for an hour, then  leave. Me, Byock and Wagner will go fetch the survivor. Use your radio if you need us.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow:** Fine.
&gt; 
&gt; //Jarvis and Agent Lindow leave the remainder of the group.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** Isn&#39;t splitting up a bad idea?
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** It lets us multitask, and they weren&#39;t going to come with us anyway. Where&#39;s the survivor?
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** That&#39;s the odd part — they&#39;re inside a containment chamber.
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** That mustn&#39;t be a survivor. It&#39;s a skip.
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** It&#39;s not. All the humanoid sips are accounted for; in their container, or dead. The containment chamber isn&#39;t registered for a humanoid either, so it&#39;s moved at minimum.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Fine, lead the way.
&gt; 
&gt; //Several minutes elapse as Agents Sturluson, Byock and Wagner navigate to Site-19&#39;s Euclid containment wing.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow, Radio:** Sturluson, we got a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** What now.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lindow, Radio:** The nukes are buggered. Controls are smashed beyond repair, manual override is wrecked. Looks like our friend came through and disarmed them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Fucking… is there anything Jarvis can do? Can he fix it?
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Lindow does not respond.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Lindow, can Jarvis fix it?
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Lindow does not respond.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Lindow, are you there?
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** If the interfaces are screwed, there’s nothing we can do. We’ll have to come back with a functional one.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Lindow, respond!
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** She isn’t going to respond.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** And how would you know that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** Because Jarvis isn’t responding either. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** Look, we just… we just get the guy, get out of here, right? We, we tell the others that the consoles were destroyed, and they bring someone else in to clean up, right?
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** I don’t think we have any other choices, excluding abandoning the survivor.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** No. We said we were going to get them, and we’re going to get them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** Well we’d better bust a move before – fuck!
&gt; 
&gt; //[[[SCP-173]]] appears in front of Agent Byock. Agents Sturluson and Wagner maintain eye contact with SCP-173 while Agent Byock recovers.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Get up Byock, we need to move.
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** Blinking.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Shut the door.
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** Shut… yeah, shut the…
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Byock closes a door, obstructing line-of-sight with SCP-173. The door is struck from the other side until a crack forms in the door.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** It’s going to smash through.
&gt; 
&gt; //ATF 4 proceed to the Euclid containment wing at an accelerated pace. SCP-173 pursues the group, destroying obstructions while unobserved. On several occasions it utilises alternate routes in an attempt to outflank the group; the open doorways throughout the site enable it to traverse large distances unnoticed by the group. Agent Byock leads the group to the inhabited containment chamber.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** This… this is the one.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** You’re joking.
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** This is seventeen-three’s chamber.
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** And it’s got the guy in it. It’s not my fault he picked this one.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Fine just… just get the doors open. Wagner, watch that other door over there.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Byock opens the bulkhead doors; damage sustained prevents them from opening enough to allow access.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Byock:** It’s stuck!
&gt; 
&gt; **???:** Have you started the countdown?
&gt; 
&gt; //Agents Sturluson and Wagner leave their positions, attempting to  force the bulkhead doors open.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** No sir. The nukes have been destroyed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Wagner:** It’s not moving.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Keep trying. Byock, get over here!
&gt; 
&gt; **???:** No. You three, leave. The next group can fetch me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sturluson:** Sir, you know –
&gt; 
&gt; //The lights in the main room flicker.//
&gt; 
&gt; **???:** It doesn’t bother me. Just go, now. 
&gt; 
&gt; //All lights in the main room turn off. The sound of a door being destroyed is heard, followed by three snaps in quick succession. SCP-173 appears at the gap in the bulkhead, illuminated by the containment chamber’s interior lighting and facing in.//
&gt; 
&gt; **???:** Fuck you. I&#39;ll get out eventually.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-173 disappears from view before the bulkhead doors are closed again.//
