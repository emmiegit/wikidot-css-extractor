**Item #:** SCP-3844

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** --While proper facilities are under construction-- SCP-3844 is to be contained at its dwelling within the Dolomite Mountains. A 100m x 100m perimeter is to be regularly patrolled by Foundation personnel to ensure no civilians come into contact with SCP-3844. 

Anti-aircraft artillery is to be positioned around SCP-3844&#39;s dwelling. --Artillery is to fire at any airborne entities over the containment perimeter. Any evidence of the existence of SCP-3844 is to be attributed to bombing runs.-- ##blue|Artillery is only to be used in the event of a full scale containment breach.## 

Once a week, one --D-Class-- ##blue|member of the SCP-3844 project## is to be sent to interact with SCP-3844, ##blue|and take temperature and radiation measurements. A team of researchers are to take size measurements, perform IQ tests, and determine the maximum temperature of fire SCP-3844 can expel once per month.## Personnel caught stealing items from SCP-3844 are to be disciplined accordingly.

##blue|SCP-3844 is to be provided with the following reading material as part of its monthly measurements:##
* ##blue|Time Magazine##
* ##blue|Science Magazine##
* ##blue|Nature Magazine##
* ##blue|Communications of the ACM##

**Description:** SCP-3844 is a winged reptile, measuring --73.76m-- ##blue|50.22m## from tail to head, and with a wing span of --67.42m-- ##blue|42.78m##[[footnote]] According to most recent measurements.[[/footnote]]. It is estimated to mass --27,000kg-- ##blue|18,000kg##. SCP-3844&#39;s scales are of a --purple-- ##blue|blue## hue, except around the stomach where they are much lighter. SCP-3844 is capable of --expelling fire at 3400°C from its mouth through an unknown method-- ##blue| forcefully expelling a methane vapor from its mouth (achieving temperatures as high as 1950°C), and igniting it through unknown means.##

SCP-3844 is capable of speech in --at least 14-- ##blue|7## languages, and has --an extensive--  ##blue|moderate## knowledge of world events. During direct interactions with personnel, SCP-3844 takes the form of an adult male, however SCP-3844 ##blue|claims it## can mimic the appearance of any human. 

SCP-3844 inhabits an immense cavern that contains --a currently unquantified amount of valuable metals-- ##blue| 2.69x10^^6^^kg of valuable metals (approximately 2.6 billion US dollars)##. SCP-3844 often burrows underneath these materials, where it presumably sleeps. 

##blue|In conversation, SCP-3844 has confirmed that it is the inspiration behind a number of european myths involving dragons. It also claims to be the model for the Welsh flag[[footnote]] &#34;I used to be red you know. A vibrant red to match the fire I&#39;d breathe. Those were indeed good days.&#34;[[/footnote]].## 

**Addendum:** The following is a transcript of an interview between --Dr. Lester Fegmont-- ##blue|O5-2## and SCP-3844.

&gt; ##blue|&lt;**Begin Log**&gt;##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** I see you&#39;ve finally returned. A few years late, but I guess that&#39;s only to be expected.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**O5-2:** Yes, I guess I am a little late. Sorry about that.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** Don&#39;t worry about it. You&#39;re obviously busy, and in the meantime, I&#39;ve had all manner of new reading material. How long had you known about the nature of light?##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**O5-2:** //[smiles]// Decades at least.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** And the inner workings of our smallest building block?##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**O5-2:** We cracked open the atom during the war.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** Before long you might have an explanation for my kind!##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**O5-2:** Well, you&#39;d be surprised how far science can get you. My division has discovered that some things aren&#39;t even anomalous in the first place.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** So, has science finally found a way to let me stretch my wings?##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**O5-2:** Unfortunately, due to certain advances in radar, we can&#39;t risk you leaving the cavern. However, I&#39;ve asked others to devise a way to possibly... expand your home.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** Oh have you? I&#39;m looking forward to this now.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**O5-2:** I do have to be on my way. Hopefully I will see you again.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|**SCP-3844:** I hope so as well.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|&lt;**End Log**&gt;##
