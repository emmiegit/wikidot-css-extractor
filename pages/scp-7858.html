**Item #:** SCP-7858

**Object Class:** Pending

**Special Containment Procedures:**
Foundation algorithms should review available databases of text messages. Algorithms are to search for:
* Messages referring to a person not in the subject&#39;s contacts,
* An account with activity metadata inconsistent with the number of messages it has sent,
* Messages by adults implying the existence of a child for which there is no legally significant record.

All staff assigned to SCP-7858 require written confirmation from their psychologist and immediate superior that: 
# They have no mental health conditions,
# They have a stable and active social life. 
Staff on the SCP-7858 project receive category 3-M psychological hazard pay. 

**Description:**
The nature of SCP-7858 is currently being determined by staff. 

SCP-7858 manifests as a series of text messages. These messages will reference a person who does not exist. The account owners will have no recollection of the person. They exhibit no abnormal behavior. The only other potential evidence of the absent person is the &#39;//holes//&#39; they leave. &#39;//Hole//&#39; is a technical term in anti-memetics referring to the absence of something that may logically have existed, as implied by, but not proved by, its surroundings.[[footnote]] The existence of //holes// is a proven thaumatological phenomenon. When a working is cast into a //hole//, the fact that the outcome of the working could reasonably exist mitigates backlash. While statistically significant, the effect is not considered useful outside of academia.[[/footnote]]

SCP-7858 is either a weak memetic or powerful anti-memetic entity. These theories are referred to respectively as SCP-7858-A (&#39;Theory A&#39;) and SCP-7858-B (&#39;Theory B&#39;).

//Theory A//: In the event that SCP-7858-A is a weak memetic entity, then SCP-7858-A generates a series of anomalous text messages. It has no bearing on any person or physical entity. The text messages will usually appear without those involved noticing. SCP-7858-A requires a series of interlocking //holes//. Together, these holes must imply the existence of a hypothetical person. SCP-7858-A will fill those //holes// with the most likely hypothetical person. The fact that SCP-7858-A only appears where such holes exist makes it seem as if a person has been wiped from existence. In reality, SCP-7858-A only manifests into a situation that already implies there was once a person.

//Theory B//: In the event that SCP-7858-B is a powerful anti-memetic entity, then SCP-7858-B will erase a victim, all knowledge of that victim, and all evidence of that victim. The only thing not erased by SCP-7858-B is digital records between third-party devices. Records connected to the device of a victim are presumably eradicated with the device. SCP-7858-B will not &#39;re-run&#39; history. Therefore, a victim eliminated by SCP-7858-B creates //holes// in the lives of the people they knew. Proposed //holes// include unspent funds that correspond to money spent on the victim, periods of social isolation corresponding to knowing the victim, or major life choices made based on knowing the victim.

[[include component:coltop show=+ Note By Intern |hide=- Close ]]

Hey there cobber. I&#39;m sorry my notes are a bit on the casual side. I&#39;m Greg, from the Aussie division, and I&#39;m actually a techy. Apparently, I got bumped up to intern scientist for this. I&#39;m a bit of a blockhead for things that don&#39;t spark though. I&#39;m thinking they just grab people for this project. Anyway, I&#39;ve never done any science, I just do computers. I&#39;m not half bad at that though. I did a little digging to give ya some extra info while I was putting this all together. If it&#39;s a mess though now you know why. 

I&#39;m glad to we working with you guys! Happy reading mate!

Charlotte asks Daniel who she should invite to her party. This is the first conversation between Charlotte and Daniel mentioning Matthew. 

[[image Ex%201%20Charlotte%20Daniel.png]]

//Intern Note//

Charlotte and Daniel were close before Matthew. I found 27,000 texts between them in the last 5 years. Daniel and Matthew were studying together and were pretty good friends. I don&#39;t know how Charlotte knows about Matthew, I guess she might&#39;ve sat in or met Daniel after class?

I find it interesting that Charlotte specifically checks in with Daniel about Matthew. It could just be because they know each other, but maybe Charlotte already liked Matthew before this party.

A conversation between Charlotte and Daniel on the night of the party. 

[[image Ex%202%20Daniel%20Charlotte.png]]

//Intern Note//

Looks like this was a real rager. Daniel texts differently, I think he&#39;s on mobile with autocorrect on. I cracked his Facebook and it seems most of his messages are sent from a computer. Thanks to his bargain bin VPN I now know it has a 2080 GPU and Ryzen 7300, which is some serious firepower. Probably a gamer.

I think Daniel has a thing for Charlotte. Feels a bit like a cry for help when he says she should &#39;ignore him.&#39; Maybe he&#39;s just stressed about losing his mate though.

A conversation between Charlotte and Daniel on the night after the party. 

[[image Ex%203-2%20Daniel%20Charlotte.png]]

//Intern Note//

Looks like Daniel is back on his PC. Both of them feel a bit vulnerable, probably because they had such a big night. I reckon Charlotte is sussing out her odds with Matthew. She jumps straight on Daniel when he says he wouldn&#39;t date someone he doesn&#39;t know well. Matthew and Charlotte probably haven&#39;t talked much at this point.

Daniel doesn&#39;t do Matthew any favors by telling Charlotte she doesn&#39;t need to go. Everything he says he wants from a girlfriend maps nicely onto Charlotte too. If he likes Charlotte, Daniel isn&#39;t being too subtle.

A conversation between Charlotte and Enola. Enola thanks Charlotte for helping her with something.

[[image Ex%204%20Charlotte%20Enola.png]]

//Intern Note//

This writing is pretty uptight for Enola. She always does her best to sound proper but she&#39;s normally more of a doll. She&#39;s making the effort though. We know Enola is the lonely type, she probably really wants to be closer to Charlotte but is worried she might spook her, from her or Matthew. Looks like Charlotte has been sleeping over a good bit at Matthew&#39;s, so they&#39;re probably going steady at this point. Charlotte still seems awkward though.

//27 10 2020//

A conversation between Charlotte and Daniel. Charlotte invites Daniel out to go drinking.

[[image Ex%205-2%20Charlotte%20Daniel.png]] 

//Intern Note//

This conversation wasn&#39;t flagged, I had to do a bit of scrolling. It&#39;s important for understanding what comes next.

It doesn&#39;t seem like Matthew comes along. Something is probably up with him and Charlotte. She seems like she //wants// to get hammered. Never a good sign. My ex-wife went pretty hard on the goon before the end too. Just a thought, but given Daniel isn&#39;t too subtle about fancying Charlotte, maybe she knows Daniel likes her. So when she&#39;s in a tough spot, she uses him as help.

I also found something creepy. I am regenerating these messages from a data leak. Charlotte never had this profile picture according to Facebook. In it, you see her holding someone&#39;s hand. This should be Matthew. If I&#39;m right, this hand is the only bit of Matthew Clay anyone will ever see. I hope the poor kid wasn&#39;t real. I feel like I just dug up a corpse.

Charlotte messages Daniel after their night out. 

[[image Ex%206-2%20Charlotte%20Daniel.jpg]]

//Intern Note//

Charlotte says she went to sleep over at Matthews and Daniel hits her with a one-word response. The poor lad is probably suffering at this point, being yanked around at the whims of Charlotte&#39;s relationship. It&#39;s hard to tell whether she and Matthew are really on the rocks. There&#39;s been no mention of a potential breakup so I think they&#39;re still going strong. I buy that she cares about Daniel though. From the materials I&#39;ve read, there&#39;s no evil there, just a girl who&#39;s hurting.

Enola messages Charlotte asking if she wants to go to the gym. Some of Matthew&#39;s habits are discussed.

[[image Ex%207%20Charlotte%20Enola.png]]

//Intern Note//

This is wholesome. It seems like Charlotte and Enola have connected over the four or so months since the last texts. Enola even uses emojis now. I was able to hack into the client list of the gym, it shows that Charlotte did join that Saturday. I guess that&#39;s why the messages would be about that Saturday though.

Enola messages Charlotte discussing how she is feeling sick. 

[[image Ex%2010%20Charlotte%20Enola.png]]

//Intern Note//

I was able to confirm that on the thirteenth Enola contacted her boss and took three days off from work. I couldn&#39;t find any family in Enola&#39;s Facebook friends. She must&#39;ve relied on Matthew pretty hard, and probably Charlotte too at this point. Being sick alone at home sucks, and she&#39;s getting on in years.

This is the last flagged exchange. Enola Clay and Charlotte Chase never talk again. Matthew is never mentioned again. That means on the thirteenth of March Matthew Clay, if he was ever real, ceased to exist.

&gt; //Field Report: AM-0447 Quantifiables//
&gt; 
&gt; The SCP-7858 research team has conducted background checks on the PoIs of this case. Evidence below has been flagged as potentially relevant.
&gt; 
&gt; Research work identified the &#39;mother&#39; of Matthew, Enola Clay. Enola married &#39;Harry Chang&#39; in 1997, and divorced him in 2005. This time would encompass Matthew&#39;s birth. 
&gt; 
&gt; Observation showed that Enola&#39;s current rental, which she moved into in 2007, contains three bedrooms. Two of these are currently guest rooms. They are rarely used. It has been posited that this financial burden was necessitated because one of the guest rooms was Matthew&#39;s room. Enola has claimed she &#39;got a good deal&#39; when approached by a field agent at a bar. Agents were unable to recover the original tenancy contract.
&gt; 
&gt; Enola&#39;s savings are considerable. These savings were mostly acquired from 1999 to today. Her savings rate rose significantly in 2005. Her saving pattern during this period differs significantly from her pre-marital pattern, assessed from 1990 to 1997. It has been proposed that these savings represent money spent on Matthew. Savings are 9% greater than the statistical average amount spent on raising a child by single mothers. Employee assistance program records indicate her divorce had a serious effect on her.
&gt; 
&gt; In August 2021, Daniel switched majors from Politics to Computer Science. This may have been motivated by Matthew&#39;s disappearance, as they would previously have been studying politics together. Having lost his closest social connection in the degree may have been the final push to change major. 
&gt; 
&gt; Charlotte Chase was identified as the &#39;partner&#39; of Matthew. In May of 2021, she sought counseling from &#39;NAMI Kern County,&#39; a local not-for-profit mental health service. This is around two months after Matthew&#39;s supposed disappearance. She had never sought counseling previously. It is proposed this is because Matthew previously acted as emotional support.

Foundation agents staged a robbery at NAMI Kern County, the psychology not-for-profit attended by Charlotte Chase. Various unnetworked data on Charlotte Chase was recovered. The following is a converted Word document written by Charlotte for her psychologist &#39;expressing her feelings&#39; regarding Daniel.

&gt; Okay. I&#39;m just doing this stream of consciousness style. 
&gt; 
&gt; I think honestly this all started with Freddy. He was my boyfriend back in highschool. Really popular and fit but also always so gentle, I felt lucky just to be around him. We didn&#39;t sleep together. We just went on dates and tried different coffee spots and playgrounds late at night. Our first kiss was on the swings at 11, when it was dark enough to see the stars. I think I was really happy, and I&#39;ll never be able to fall in love like that again. 
&gt; 
&gt; Freddy cheated on me. The girl was really into him. Honestly, I think she wasn&#39;t entirely okay. She got pictures of them doing it, or at least people told me it was her. She always denied it. Those pictures ended up everywhere though. They were explicit. I saw it and I remember just having to sit down. I thought I was going to marry Freddy. I&#39;m never going to forget seeing that boy I loved naked in a photo with someone else. It was the first time I even saw him shirtless. I threw up in front of everyone and the next day my hands kept shaking.
&gt; 
&gt; I never talked to Freddy again. That&#39;s probably one of my many problems. I run away from things I can&#39;t handle. I still think about it though. I haven&#39;t been in love since. Now, Daniel. We were already friends before everything happened. We weren&#39;t super close till university, but it helped. He wasn&#39;t so much a guy as just a friend and that&#39;s probably the reason I could be around him. In Uni we got close. I don&#39;t know why. I really liked him though. He was relaxed but would spend lots of time with me and that&#39;s something I really need.
&gt; 
&gt; I kind of knew Daniel liked me. He was always there, he texted weird stuff, and when he gets drunk he was really huggy. I think I used him. Whenever something went wrong I&#39;d call Daniel and we&#39;d drink. Obviously, he was always up for it. That kind of on-tap support is addictive. 
&gt; 
&gt; Then I got really drunk and we slept together. It was stupid. I was just feeling down and I drank way too much, then it happened. Nothing sexy or wild. After that I just couldn&#39;t see him the same way. He was a guy now, not a friend. Whenever I see him I remember what he looked like naked. It makes me want to punch myself.
&gt; 
&gt; I regret it more than anything. I feel like this was where it all went wrong for me, and I lost a lot of friends when I lost Daniel. Nobody nearly as important but it was the rest of what I had. I can&#39;t take it back. I really really really want to. But every time I look at him I get so scared I want to puke. I can&#39;t even text him anymore. I miss him so much.

[[include component:coltop show=+ Interview with Enola Clay |hide=- Close ]]

Foundation agents shadowed Enola Clay for several days. It was found she frequented a local bar alone and often spoke to strangers. Agent &#39;Joshua Zacherensky,&#39; 35, was dispatched to interview her while pretending to be a patron. 

The following are extracts from their conversation.

&gt; Agent Zacherensky: Hey&#39;a.
&gt; Enola Clay: Hello there?
&gt; Z: I&#39;m Josh. You here alone too?
&gt; E: Yeah I am- just enjoying a drink after work.
&gt; Z: Are you the sort who enjoys a chat with their drink? I don&#39;t want-
&gt; E: Not at all! Please, here! Tell me about yourself!
&gt; [Enola pulls up a chair. Agent Zacherensky repeats the cover story.]
&gt; ...
&gt; Z: Can I buy you a drink?
&gt; E: Sure! Get one for yourself- and I&#39;ll buy the next round.
&gt; Z: Oh, you&#39;re great. What do you want?
&gt; ...
&gt; E: Honestly, it&#39;s so hard getting to know people in this town. Everyone already has their cliques. It&#39;s really nice that you came to talk to me you know-
&gt; Z: -and you to me, I feel like I don&#39;t meet enough people-
&gt; E: -Right? At work it&#39;s pretty bad. Back in the day I picked a job that was just close to home, but I decided I wanted the higher salary and honestly I am not sure if that was a mistake. The pay isn&#39;t bad but I feel like nobody cares about each other at all. Oh- bartender- yeah two-- you like Gin right?
&gt; [Zacharensky does finger guns]
&gt; E: Gin and Tonics, please. Where, oh right, yeah so there&#39;s really no community to it. Nobody wanted to come tonight.
&gt; Z: Did things used to be better?
&gt; E: Yeah I think. I used to just go home after the old job, but at least that was my choice. It //feels// better you know? Still. If I can get a bit, sorry that&#39;s the Gin talking, but since the divorce I think I&#39;ve not really made any real friends. And the ones I had are pretty much gone. Sorry. I just wanted to vent a little.
&gt; Z: No kids?
&gt; E: I-- I always wanted kids. I wish I had a kid or two. I&#39;m getting old and I just don&#39;t want to be alone at the... I think I don&#39;t want to talk about this sorry. Tell me about you? Why are you here alone?
&gt; ...
&gt; Z: Actually, do you know a Charlotte Chase? I think she mentioned you once.
&gt; [Enola thinks for several seconds. She is intoxicated.]
&gt; E: Charlotte... Hmm. No I don&#39;t think so. There used to be a girl at my gym called Charlotte I think. She left around June? Maybe July? Might be her. Didn&#39;t talk to her much though.

yeah honestly it is a bit
i guess now i get to just vent
well like you know the whole thing that happened a bit back with her right?
well we havent talked much since
i saw her at that party at laneys but tbh she was pretty cold to me
anyway i like asked her about it and she said shed had a big think and had like one to therapy
gone*
she thinks that the whole thing with freddy back in highschool kinda fucked her up and now she really isnt okay with guys who are into her, like she thinks they are gonna betray her and stuff
so when she figured out i liked her
and she knew fml
she saw me as being just another dude and that meant i wanst trust worthy and stuff
and since she just hasnt been able to see me as a friend anymore
which is pretty shit
tbh i dont even really see it, like she was pretty cool with guys back at the start of uni, this mostly seemed to kick off when that thing between us happened 
so dunno if i buy her story
anywsy
and then she got drunk as fuck and spewed 
she started crying and she told me that she missed me and wished this hadn&#39;t happen, she tried to hit herself at one point, 
it was scary
she just raised her hand up and i could see her getting ready to just pound it into herself
then she clenched her hand and stopped and just kind of kept crying
she says shes alone now
anyway i texted her after and kinda tried to re open things
but she fully cold shouldered me, like one word responses
so i guess thats that you know. end of my first love
i hate it though. honestly im not proud of it but when she was gone i locked myself in the bathroom and cried then i told everyone i was throwing up
it&#39;d be easier if she had a boyfriend or something
i guess thats a bit sexist of me, like, &#39;oh i can&#39;t cope&#39; but i respect it as soon as there&#39;s another guy involved
but i guess it wouldn&#39;t feel so much like she rejects... me... as a person
i just wish this hadn&#39;t happened and i fucking hate it
i think sleeping with her is the worst thing ive ever done and all the rest of this shit is just karma
i betrayed her for one night
i guess it isnt weird she doesnt wanna be around me
but its done now and i only think about it like once a week
happy now?

++ Contemplating SCP-7858-B

**Subject:** Contemplating SCP-7858-B

Hello staff,

I have been briefly drafted into the remit of the SCP-7858 project. I understand that most of you are not used to classification work. However, SCPs are not classified by gods or O5s. This is work that actually needs to be done by scientists. Test my ideas without concern for rank and remit, just think your comments through. I am too busy to have my time wasted by pandering.

SCP-7858-B should be favored. We should look at the sheer coherence of the evidence provided to us. 

We see that those left behind by the SCP event all have clear and present simultaneous changes in their lives. His mother decides to change her job. This is Probably because her home life no longer brings her any joy (So going back to it is no longer a goal). The friend group implodes according to Charlotte, though she says that&#39;s because of Daniel. Charlotte also seeks therapy for the first time. Daniel also changes major.

There is no way to be sure which of the two theories is accurate. However, it seems unlikely that so many coincidences would not merely group together but occur at the same time. All evidence suggests Matthew was once real. Therefore, we should prefer Theory B.

We deal with the incredible on a daily basis. If I told you we contained a game of Monopoly that controlled the housing market of a small midwestern town, I imagine you would believe me. We have all even heard rumors, however dubious, that some departments are responsible for the continued survival of humanity. It makes us forget ourselves.

When assessing an SCP event, we should look to what is //likely//.

There has been a total of roughly 20,000 identified SCP-7858 events. While this sounds like a lot, compared to the nearly 8 billion people on this planet, that is minuscule. That is some 0.0003% of people alive right now. And we have the entire span of every one of those 8 billion lives. Every second could be the right one. When you can stack that many rolls of the dice you //will// get weird results by chance. Rolling a natural 20 is a 5% chance for comparison. You should imagine yourself trying to pull a specific Uno card, but the deck goes on forever and you get to try five hundred times. Suddenly it&#39;s not just likely you&#39;ll get the green four you need, it&#39;s practically guaranteed. It is not surprising that across the lifetimes of billions of people, you pull the right card.

It is obvious that the preconditions for SCP-7858-A events can arise naturally. Now, let&#39;s contemplate the events themselves. What is more likely? An intangible undetectable force that randomly wipes people from existence, for reasons unknown? Or another of a common class of relatively harmless memetic entities. It is obviously more likely that this is just another meme. We have many tools with which to detect the anomalous. We know what cards are in this Uno deck. As far as we know people just disappearing isn&#39;t one of them. Hence Theory A is more likely.

I will also briefly turn my mind to the question of motivation. SCPs do not necessarily need motivations. However, a substantial number of SCPs were made in some way; almost never simply for fun. Even if it is for fun, creating a real-world board game generates entertainment. That remains a motive. There is no clear motive for wiping from existence an insignificant number of people, AKA SCP-7858-B. However, I can easily conceive of the motivation for SCP-7858-A. It would be meant to fill holes in the lives of sad and disconnected people. If I could do such a thing, even I would consider it. It simply isn&#39;t successful. 

It is too weak to actually generate a new person, so as thaumatological workings are known to do, it goes about 1% of the way and does the easiest thing. That is generate some text messages. It lacks the power to even do that properly. So it is only able to manifest where it is most likely to be: in the lives of people with perfectly overlapping holes, that 0.0003% of cases. The meme does not create that situation. It can only appear and survive when it already exists. 

In the absence of evidence to support SCP-7858-B we should not waste our turn on some long-shot theory. We should assume SCP-7858 is not some unique occurrence, but just another memetic entity.

I look forward to hearing your commentary.

**Subject:** Are we affected??

I feel like I may have been affected by SCP-7858. Specifically, the -B variant, which I believe we can all agree is the more likely of the two. 

When I first arrived at this job, I felt like I fit in. It was sort of a camaraderie. For some reason I cannot make sense of I was quite happy to just stand at the edge of events and talk to people when they wanted to talk to me. This is never a truly fun job, but for me it was fulfilling.

That&#39;s not how I feel anymore. For the past year, I just can&#39;t do these things. I get quite anxious about annoying people or getting in their way, and standing around at a party would have made me bring down the mood. There are other things too. I use a mood tracker, and around the time that I feel I was disconnected from everyone, my mood tracking dropped //hard//. Nothing else changed at that point- I just sort of stopped going. 

This all makes sense if I was a victim of SCP-7858, or rather, someone close to me. Probably another one of our colleagues. 

It is Foundation policy to delete the text messages created by an SCP-7858 event. They are kept on our servers alone to &#39;avoid distressing victims&#39;. All of our phones have Foundation observation software on them. 

What do we all think? I think we should be honest about the effects of SCP-7858 so we can confront it together. I know if I vanished, I would want to be remembered. I am sure you all feel the same way.

Thankyou.

Junior Researcher Harrison,

Remain professional. Turn your mind to @RArmistead&#39;s excellent debate post. The chances that you are affected are exceedingly slim. You should picture yourself stepping outside and being struck by lightning. 

The danger that this SCP poses is not of a memetic nature, but that which dangerous information has always posed. It hurts people. You may picture yourself depressed now, but if you actually knew that someone near you had simply vanished, the fear and loss would be much more harmful. If -B is accurate, anyone affected is already suffering. We should not kick them while they are down.

I ask that discussion be kept on topic and scientific.

Eminently,
Assistant Site Director Hoexter.

With all due respect,

Assistant site director, this is a problem of the Foundation&#39;s own making. Our obsession with information control is not an end unto itself. We do not hide things for the sake of hiding them. As you point out, the real harm in losing somebody is how their disappearance leaves us adrift. Their memory is neither here nor there. Yet, that memory has value!

Imagine the suffering of Enola Clay. She loved her son. She dedicated much of her life to him. The reason she goes to a bar every other day, desperately trying to meet someone, to stop being alone, is because her family itself ceased to exist. At this rate she may never find another.

If she at least knew she could make sense of her situation. Instead of believing she never found anyone, that she is doomed to be alone, she would understand that she has been the victim of a terrible happenstance. She could draw strength from that. Some people are struck by lightning site director. Let us not lie to victims.

If you have any heart at all you should support my position.

Control yourself Junior Researcher.

Even contemplating informing a member of the public is deeply unprofessional. Controlling information always has a purpose. Evidently, this information is tempting staff in dangerous ways. Informing all staff of these events will only raise their level of stress. As Enola proves, it also has no benefit. Enola frequents local bars seeking companionship and tries to reach out to work colleagues. Remembering her son would not make her more successful. That knowledge only has the potential to harm her. The grief attached and the guilt of forgetting could destroy her. It may even kill her. 

There is no benefit to such painful and dangerous memories. The Foundation policy was not conceived without due consideration.

I recommend you seek psychological support regarding this matter. If you are feeling alone, the fortnightly game of dodgeball between the research and janitorial staff is good for connecting with people.

Sanguingly,
Assistant Site Director Hoexter.

As per my last post, 

This is not dangerous information. We are not children. Pain can make us stronger. Enola&#39;s current situation is clearly already bad for her. Every lonely day hurts, I know that well. Giving her memories of her son isn&#39;t kicking her when she&#39;s down, it&#39;s giving her something to cling to. Making someone stronger can save them. People also deserve to be remembered. Matthew Clay may be gone, but that doesn&#39;t mean he does not matter.

The real motivation that the Foundation has for holding back this kind of information is that it tries to control everything. Assistant site director, you sound like a fascist. Truth has value. There&#39;s nothing wrong with remembering the people who died. Whether they were eaten by a chair or just vanished one day. We owe that to them on a basic moral level.

I have locked this thread.

This, everybody, is why the psychological health requirements were created.  

This thread is hysterical and helps nobody. Further, researcher Harrison became extremely distressed by the concept that he would also be wiped from existence. I have appended what happened next at my personal discretion. Take this to be a lesson. And no, this is not a psy-op to kill off a dangerous idea, we are the Foundation, not Nazi Germany.

SCP-7858 is a dangerous idea. Not because of any memetic or supernatural reason, it simply hurts the most vulnerable among us to think this way. Do not share your research with anyone who has not passed psychological screening. All bonuses and half of hazard pay for the past year which you received will be **recalled** if you do.

Graciously,
Assistant Site Director Hoexter.

&gt; **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
&gt; Date of action: 3/9/2021.
&gt; Involved units: Site-28 Security Team, SCP-7858 Field Agents
&gt; 
&gt; On the 2nd of September it was realized that Junior Researcher &#39;Harrison&#39; (ID:JR1036-HARRISON) had not attended site-28 for his shift. Security attempted to access the tracking subroutine on JR Harrison&#39;s phone. The phone did not respond. The routine relies on the phone&#39;s own location-tracking features.
&gt; 
&gt; At 1:56 PM, JR Harrison&#39;s phone reported its location. It had automatically connected to a wireless network and so could be tracked via IP address. It came from a Kern County Starbucks. Only two field agents remained in Kern Country: Agent Tiffany Brown and Agent Joshua Zacherensky. They decided that PoIs Charlotte Chase and Enola Clay were JR Harrison&#39;s most likely destinations and split up accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; At 2:11 PM, Agent Zacherensky spotted JR Harrison through the window of Enola Clay&#39;s home. He called local police posing as an FBI agent. He described JR Harrison as a drug dealer. Agent Zacherensky activated the listening software on the PoI&#39;s phones while he waited for the police. Transcript appended.

&gt; **TRANSCRIPT**
&gt; 
&gt; Junior Researcher Harrison: Thankyou for letting me in.
&gt; Enola Clay: That&#39;s no problem Mr Harrison, could you tell me what this is about though?
&gt; H: Of course. I understand this may be hard to believe, but I work with a large organization that, among other things, catalogs missing persons. Look, here&#39;s my ID.
&gt; E: &#39;Foundation.&#39; Well I&#39;ve certainly never heard of you.
&gt; H: They put some work into that.
&gt; E: I see... So why are you here?
&gt; H: I have been asked not to share this with you, but there have been a lot of irregularities around you. 
&gt; E: What do you mean?
&gt; H: Strange spending patterns, text-
&gt; E: You think I am a victim of fraud?
&gt; H: Not precisely. Here, I have a series of text messages that come from your phone. They&#39;ve been deleted since, but I think you will find they match your texting style. Here are some other conversations about the same topic. Please read them. I think it will make things clear to you.
&gt; [Several minutes pass. Enola is seen through the window flicking through several sheets. She appears to have read all of the pages. A police car approaches with its sirens off.]
&gt; E: I&#39;m confused, what is this meant to prove?
&gt; H: Doesn&#39;t it feel like something is wrong in your life? Like you&#39;re missing something?
&gt; E: Well, don&#39;t we all feel that way.
&gt; H: No, not everyone does. Enola, something terrible has happened to you. You were closer to people once, and then an outside power intervened. You have a right to remember Matthew.
&gt; [Police approach the door quietly.]
&gt; E: I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. I don&#39;t remember sending any of these messages, and I don&#39;t have a son or know any Matthews.
&gt; H: You have to-
&gt; [Police open the door and begin to rapidly enter the room.]
&gt; Police Officer (Gloster Potemkin): Hesterly Harrison, you&#39;re under arrest for drug trafficking! Hands in the air!
&gt; H: What? Drug traffi- no wait!
&gt; PO: Ma&#39;am, tell me what your involvement with this man is!
&gt; E: He&#39;s been peddling an insane story that I have a son who I don&#39;t remember. He just showed up at my house. I don&#39;t know him. 
&gt; H: Enola please, you have to believe me! //You had a son!//
&gt; PO: Had a bit too much fun with the goods, ey? We&#39;ve all been there. Come on- hands out.
&gt; H: I&#39;m putting my life on the line for this! You can see that I&#39;m serious-- do I seem like I&#39;m lying to you? 
&gt; E: Yes of course you&#39;re lying to me! 
&gt; H: They&#39;re trying to silence me right now! Please just listen-- believe me-- that&#39;s all I want. I&#39;ll be gone in a moment just I beg you remember h--
&gt; E: You&#39;re deranged- deranged and cruel. I&#39;ve always wanted a child, and here you are peddling this nonsense about a life I haven&#39;t had! Is that what you do? Do you prey on the vulnerable? Were you going to give me some &#39;special little pill&#39; to make it all feel better? Maybe a &#39;trip&#39; to remembering him? I would //never// **ever** forget a child I had! How dare you make up something like this? You cruel fuck- Who&#39;s Matthew?
&gt; 
&gt; **Recording Ended.**
&gt; JR Harrison is apprehended. After an amnestic and psychological treatment, he is returned to work in a low-risk position. He remains on the watch list.
