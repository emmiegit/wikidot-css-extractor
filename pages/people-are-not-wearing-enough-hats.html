&#34;…which brings us once again to the pressing issue of just how much there is left to contain,&#34; said the Head of Foundation Staff to the meeting, shuffling the papers in his hands. A collection of bored individuals sat before him. An excited looking man started to fiddle with the projector up front.

&#34;Next on the agenda,&#34; continued the Head of Staff, &#34;Researcher Erit Invictus has a proposition for a new class of SCP.&#34; A collective groan came from those assembled.

&#34;Now, now, hold your complaints,&#34; said Erit, starting up his presentation, displaying the Foundation symbol. &#34;First off, this is not another class of &#39;SCP&#39;. It&#39;s an entirely different concept altogether. See,&#34; he flicked to the first slide, &#34;even though SCP stands for &#39;Secure, Contain, Protect&#39;, it has come to mean pretty much any anomalous object under the containment of the Foundation. So, what I was thinking is this.&#34;

He flipped over to the next slide, which displayed the letters &#39;NAO&#39; in black block capitals. &#34;Non-Anomalous Object.&#39; &#34;There are too many things humanity is just not ready to know about yet, but are perfectly explainable by Foundation standards. Going by the classic definition of an SCP, we can&#39;t contain them. But, with the NAO-class objects, our horizons are expanded so much further! Take that teleportation system from last month; a few hours of research on it and we understand how it works on a basic level. The problem is that it&#39;s still exceptionally buggy.

&#34;I wasn&#39;t aware of any bugs in the system,&#34; muttered a woman near Researcher Invictus.

&#34;You obviously haven&#39;t heard of the half-dozen researchers whose lower limbs would like to disagree,&#34; said Erit, shooting her a dirty look. &#34;Anyways, until such time that the human race is ready for such a thing to exist, we should contain the teleportation system.&#34;

A few people coughed in the silence that followed. At length, one man stood up and asked, &#34;Aren&#39;t we already on our way to perfecting the technology for use within the Foundation?&#34;

Erit blinked. &#34;I beg your pardon, Mister Tuomey?&#34;

&#34;Well,&#34; began Tuomey, folding his arms behind his back, &#34;I&#39;ve been supervising that project for a few weeks now, and from what my staff has told me, they&#39;ve already worked out that issue. In fact, we&#39;ve already had six successful tests in a row, wherein the subject reached the desired target without any major loss of life or limb. Sure, it&#39;s far away from the requirements of our actually using the system - there&#39;s still the matter of getting them back - but compared to most other SCPs, it&#39;s a really big step forwards.&#34;

&#34;But, but…&#34; sputtered Erit, fumbling with the button in his hand, &#34;that goes against the rules of the Foundation! You&#39;re trying to use an anomalous object for collective gain!&#34;

&#34;Didn&#39;t you just say this concept wasn&#39;t anomalous?&#34; asked Doctor Mackenzie.

Erit swallowed hard and started sweating. &#34;Well, regardless, of that, the teleportation system is still very dangerous. Until humanity is ready for it…&#34;

&#34;Wait, wait,&#34; said, Research Assistant Godbot, holding up his hands. &#34;I&#39;m confused. How do you define when humanity is ready for it?&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s actually a good question,&#34; chipped in Aelanna. &#34;There&#39;s really no way of defining such a concept, now is there?&#34;

&#34;I actually thought we&#39;d be containing really dangerous things that aren&#39;t anomalous,&#34; said Researcher Gargus, &#34;which opens up a whole new can of worms, seeing as that would be a monstrous waste of resources.&#34;

&#34;Look!&#34; shouted Erit, stamping his foot on the ground. &#34;What I&#39;m saying is that our jurisdiction isn&#39;t far enough. If we&#39;re going to be protecting people, shouldn&#39;t we expand what we can contain?&#34;

&#34;If we can understand it, why not utilize it?&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s Serpent&#39;s Hand talk!&#34;

What followed was a large amount of shouting, bickering, quarreling, and all those other words that get involved in things when an argument is started up. Needless to say, the volume continually escalated throughout all of this, making opinions harder and harder to understand. The whole mess was on the verge of physical violence when someone at the end of the table coughed. Everyone present turned to see the Head of Staff sitting perfectly still, a steely look in his eyes.

&#34;All of you sit down,&#34; he said slowly. A quick rush for chairs followed. &#34;Get back in order.&#34; A straightening of ties and clearing of throats. Silence fell over the room for a moment. Erit moved the speak once again, but the Head of Staff stopped him with a raised hand.

&#34;Mister Invictus, it appears you missed a few key points during your initial orientation. Allow me to elaborate them for you.&#34; Researcher Erit nodded his head. &#34;First off, despite our vast resources, the Foundation simply cannot afford to contain everything. Regardless of how expensive certain containments may be, they are always kept under a balanced budget. Taking in such a vast quantity of objects is simply not possible.

&#34;Second, our purpose is to contain anomalous objects. It is not explicitly stated, true, but they are the ones that only we can deal with. Normal organizations simply cannot handle them, and most Groups of Interest wish to use them for selfish or self-destructive purposes. Our focus must be on the paranormal, the supernatural; the everyday, no matter how dangerous, can be left to someone else.&#34;

&#34;But sir…&#34; began Erit, holding out his hands.

&#34;//Left to someone else//,&#34; growled the Head of Staff. Erit swallowed again and nodded. &#34;Third, as was mentioned in your little quarrel, it is not our job to decide what the human race is ready for. That should speak for itself.

&#34;And finally,&#34; he said, casting a glare over everyone else present, &#34;I want to see the attempts to utilize the teleportation system shut down. It goes against policy, and is the only thing Mister Erit got right in his presentation.&#34; He turned to look at Researcher Invictus again. &#34;We get enough of this from new members of the staff. Don&#39;t fall into old habits, Mister Invictus. That will be all.&#34; He sat back in his chair again, and reassumed a disinterested position.

Erit stood at the front of the meeting for a few moments, coughed, and switched over to his final slide. &#34;This concludes my presentation. Any questions?&#34; Several dark glares from those assembled. &#34;Right then. I&#39;ll just be…&#34; He shuffled back to his seat.

&#34;And now, our final item of the day,&#34; said the Head of Staff, shuffling his papers once more, &#34;Researcher Gargus wishes to speak to you all on the state of the fourth wall after his constant assaults on it…&#34;</textarea></pre>
