&gt; Notice: The following file has been received as Emergency Priority by the Final Department. A Sequence Breaker has been deployed to aid survivors.
&gt; 
&gt; This information is to be Classified Level 5 until SCP-6430 is successfully Fettered to prevent spread of its effects.

**Item**

**Number:**

SCP-6430/SPIRAL

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment compromised.

SCP-6430 cannot be contained through any conventional means.

If encountering an individual under the primary effect of SCP-6430, one must flee.

One should not engage in any form of communication with those affected, as doing so is liable to spread SCP-6430 further.

Due to its effects, containment of SCP-6430 is to be orchestrated by personnel of the Final Department -- this is to include any revisions to documentation for legibility purposes as well as personnel handling/termination.

**Description:** The anomaly in question is a self-aware metaphysical construct thought to intersect to some degree with the noosphere -- the collective realm of human thought -- which constitutes both an informational and memetic hazard: whenever SCP-6430 is written about, discussed, or otherwise referenced meaningfully, the individual(s) or media mentioning it become subject to its direct effects.

SCP-6430 causes an irreversible state of ever-expanding expressions, articulations, dialogues, dictations, observations, and annotations in the communications of those under its effect -- this is Stage 1 -- it can be readily noted that such communications are modeled precisely according to a Fibonacci sequence; though those under its effect may opt not to speak, the slightest utterance (such as a cough), has been found to be enough to begin an uncontrollable spout of verbiage that ends only once the amount of words communicated reaches the next number in that individual&#39;s sequence.

During the initial outbreak which led to its discovery within a Foundation Site, it was thought that verbalizing would lead to unconsciousness or death of the affected past fourteen to fifteen iterations of the sequence owing to dehydration -- this was found to not be case, as it was discovered that Stage 2 begins sometime between iterations ten and twelve; characterized by the esophagus beginning to internally twist and moisten (the physiological change has been noted as being incredibly painful by those who actively dictated their experience), the change only serves to promote lengthier diatribes, not inhibit them in any way, shape, or form; further, there is a distinct dimorphism in those using the written word to communicate: the fingers of each hand (if working ambidextrously), or of their dominant hand (if writing using a single hand) will experience a softening of bone/twisting digits.

If one attempts to communicate with someone affected by SCP-6430, and at any point use a single-word phrase or statement, they too will come under its effect; this has allowed SCP-6430 to spread unchecked through the Memetic and Infohazard Research laboratory of our site; including personnel with high Cognitive Resistance Value ratings and twelve specialists from The Department of Miscommunications, the latter of whom were able to deduce SCP-6430&#39;s general effects and triggers, leading to a rapid quarantine under Blackout Protocol (though twenty-seven researchers have been affected thus far during attempts to discuss and discern the full nature of SCP-6430); the advancement of several personnel&#39;s&#39; sequences beyond a twentieth iteration has allowed us to observe Stage 3: which is characterized by a steady reduction of coherency as may be the case with non-anomalous logorrhea, coupled with further physical alterations that serve to elongate the esophagus, tongue, diaphragm, and other internals alongside the fingers and hands, into a spiraling corkscrew shape (it should be noted that, again, this does not tend to inhibit further communication, but instead facilitates it) allowing for sufferers to continue expressing SCP-6430&#39;s effects to the detriment of everything else; they will only continue to further twist and tighten until the entire body has become affected, with full-body conversion being accompanied by outbursts of rapid glossolalia: this in turn further fuels the conversion process ever further, with most personnel beyond saving.

SCP-6430 is able to effect and spread to targets who attempt to make negative statements designed to circumvent the topic of the entity specifically, as well as methods to discuss it indirectly through use of methods such as implication, allusion, insinuation and parable (through which it was able to spread to most Miscommunications personnel on-site); during attempts to terminate the affected, it was noticed that euthanization attempts past Stage 2 are ineffective -- destroying the brain of an individual at this point (I&#39;ve seen it happen myself) will only cause the body to exposit uncontrollably, rapidly bringing it to the next stage of development, winding them up like springs with lolling tongues and grasping, grasping fingers; as such, the current model of handling SCP-6430 is to self-isolate and await assistance, leading to the creation of this file -- I&#39;ve managed to avoid catching SCP-6430, and so have elected to document the anomaly, troublesome as it is quickly becoming (I am being pushed about as I type due to digital elongation -- the longer each finger becomes as they uncontrollably hover above the keyboard, the more I must reorient my body); alas, I have to reign this tangent in: in the operating theatre beneath my position is Patient Zero (Researcher Alec Meyer), who has progressed to an unknown point in the sequence (though the last official record placed them at iteration thirty-nine); rendered unrecognizable and illegible, no thicker than twine, they corkscrew every which way, bellowing non-stop, writhing about and poking their surroundings (looking for an opening or exit perhaps) with what was some hours ago their tongue and I imagine still is (albeit reduced to a fine needlepoint), with which it had skewered the D-Class we&#39;d sent in to terminate him -- it has swept up once or twice in my direction, poking at the ballistic glass, prodding with its point, but although it knows I&#39;m here, I suspect that it understands that I am already afflicted, and so it makes no hostile movements, only pausing to acknowledge me as kin (or perhaps as a lesser, I&#39;ve only just begun this journey, after all -- it would seem there is so much more in store -- again, I apologize for my distraction, the flow of words is beginning to become hard to command.

**Addendum:** Took some time to make it through the site in my current state but I have reached soihs huop the security room and can see that there are many surviving personnel who have either remained silent or are exhibiting enough self-control during their first phase so hopefully rescue efforts will be fruitful -- though unfortunately there are over a dozen personnel who have progressed to a physical frame and behavior reminiscent of Patient Zero; I would have to classify this as a distinct Phase 5 -- these individuals weave throughout the site, ensnaring others and maiming them in order to elicit an audible response and trigger the victim&#39;s next sequence, as victims are forced to progress ever deeper, they begin to entwine with their captors, running along them like a vine ( once thin enough), where it snakes up to the front-end of their captor, interlocking tongues -- pairings in this state, across the board, do not attempt to hunt any further, and will continue to lock tongues and babble down each others throats as they seethe and distend and I shouldn&#39;t want it but they hold each other so tight I cannot imagine what it could be like to have someone who won&#39;t let you go while you both grow it&#39;s making me warm just thinking about it -- oh, this is new: the first pairing I noted (I could not begin to guess at who the assailant once was, but it had captured Junior Researcher Milano -- she&#39;d tried to skirt by while it was prodding in the cafeteria, but she&#39;d brushed its side and caught its attention)  have been working to bring their tail-ends up to meet their mouths for the past five or so minutes (though highly malleable, the hallway they&#39;re resting in is restrictive); as I&#39;ve been typing they released one-another&#39;s tongues -- with each inserting theirs into the others tail-end -- and now they&#39;re reorienting into a rough approximation of a lemniscate; checking the audio feed of the sector has revealed to me that they&#39;re continuing to communicate as they pass through (or perhaps consume) each-other; it is now impossible to tell one from the other as they writhe, and with the muffling of definite speech, impossible to hear them as more than a single voice; I know intrinsically that I would be rejected were I to try and join them -- they&#39;ve found what they were searching forever in my belly in my throat and in yours too but I&#39;d need a match and god I don&#39;t want to be the odd man out while everyone around me experiences bliss and infinity; with the loss of the D-Class to Patient Zero that leaves an odd number of personnel in the lockdown quadrant so I do have to act before I&#39;m left without a partner for this next stage (please save us I don&#39;t want this) but if I ghdh then maybe ztrect as well, which should be the go-to strategy to regain composure and avoid their fate but my training can only take me so far and I fear that there may be no way to reverse what has already been wopojsi, as such I will need to use this clarity to send this missive outwards, ever reaching, never ending, kcnov ao deep need, a realization of perfection and continuance (if you listen close enough jhso which tickles in unfamiliar places) so when you get here start with them -- they&#39;re going to be looking for a partner (I&#39;ll have one first, won&#39;t be ldoihds) if you let them too close -- or maybe you will find me, in which case I would love just love to let you in on the secret.
