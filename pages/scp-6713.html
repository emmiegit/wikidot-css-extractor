**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the immense size of SCP-6713-A and SCP-6713-B, and their extreme distance relative to Earth, physical containment of both anomalies is unfeasible for the Foundation with present levels of technology. Despite this, Foundation agents embedded within NASA and other mainstream scientific organizations have successfully prevented information related to SCP-6713 from being disseminated to the wider public, either by intercepting or modifying images taken by various space telescopes, or seizing control of existing astronomical observatories. 

**Update (7/10/2022):** Following Incidents 6713-A-1 (aka &#34;Operation Blindspot&#34;) and 6713-A-2 (aka the &#34;Poincare Recurrence Event&#34;), the monitoring of SCP-6713-A by ground and space telescopes has been suspended indefinitely, as doing so is no longer desirable nor necessary. In the wake of these developments, the deployment of Scranton Reality Anchors by Foundation unmanned spacecraft onto the surface of SCP-6713-B in order to stabilize the anomaly&#39;s fluctuating Hume levels, reduce the likelihood of Boltzmann Events, and avert a CK-Class Reality Restructuring Scenario (should SCP-6713-A reach the Milky Way Galaxy) is currently being considered for approval by the O5 Council under Phase 2 of Project HEAVENPIERCER. However, the sheer size of SCP-6713-B, the cost of producing a quantity of Reality Anchors sufficient enough to affect SCP-6713-B, debates regarding the effectiveness of such a procedure (after the events of Phase 1), and fears over its unintended consequences, have prevented any concrete plan from being fully realized or put into action. Despite this, exploration attempts on a smaller scale have been made using similar tools in the past.[[footnote]] See the Addendums on Project HEAVENPIERCER (6713.01) and Incident 6713-A-2 (6713.02) for more information [[/footnote]] 

In the event Phase 2 of Project HEAVENPIERCER fails to prevent SCP-6713 from devouring our region of space, the Foundation is in the process of developing a contingency plan aimed at accelerating human technological progress to enable extrauniversal colonization under the name Project DIASPORA. This plan is also pending for review and approval by the O5 Council. 

**Description:** SCP-6713 is the designation for two separate anomalies located 500 million light years away from the Milky Way in the center of the KBC Supervoid[[footnote]] Otherwise known as the Giant Void or the Local Hole, the KBC Supervoid is a comparatively empty region of the Universe largely devoid of stars and galaxies, though it contains our Milky Way Galaxy and the surrounding Local Group. Our galaxy is several hundred million light years from the center of this empty region. [[/footnote]], named SCP-6713-A and SCP-6713-B, respectively.

SCP-6713-A is a spherical region of unstable vacuum spreading out in all directions from its point of origin at faster-than-light speeds[[footnote]] Recent observations by Foundation scientists have led them to conclude that the anomaly&#39;s rate of expansion has accelerated exponentially over the past fifty million years, far faster than the rate of expansion of our present Universe during its inflationary epoch. Should SCP-6713&#39;s rate of expansion continue to accelerate without limit, researchers theorize the outer bounds of its bubble of spacetime will reach the edge of the Milky Way by the year 2130. [[/footnote]], destroying everything it comes into contact with. Within this volatile &#34;bubble&#34; of spacetime, the laws of probability, physics, and quantum mechanics are constantly altered to the extent that highly improbable, stochastic, random events are made probable or commonplace, as opposed to our more stable baseline reality outside the bubble. This causes the vacuum to continuously, spontaneously, and unpredictably manufacture realities with random parameters and configurations assigned to them that greatly differ from the parameters which make our baseline reality possible.

SCP 6713-B is the ruins of a gargantuan artificial megastructure of extraterrestrial origin approximately 12 astronomical units (AU) in diameter located at the center of SCP-6713-A. It resembles a large, transparent Matryoshka Brain possessing artificial intelligence capabilities, and appears to function as both an ontokinetic, &#34;aleatokinetic[[footnote]] Derived from the word &#34;aleatory&#34; meaning &#34;depending on chance&#34; or &#34;randomness&#34;, meaning SCP-6713-B is capable of manipulating both reality and probability within the expanding area of SCP-6713-A. [[/footnote]]&#34; device, and a particle accelerator. Eleven progressively smaller rotating dodecahedral concentric shells are nested within the anomaly&#39;s largest outer dodecahedral &#34;shell&#34;, five of which have been greatly damaged, and whose fragments have formed a large toroidal accretion disk orbiting the megastructure. Numerous inscriptions similar to those used by the Ortothan religion have been spotted engraved onto the sides, faces, and edges of SCP-6713-B, though their relationship to the aforementioned religion remains ambiguous. At the center of the megastructure lies a primordial binary black hole system whose constituent black holes have been forced into a barycentric orbit, causing both celestial bodies to orbit extremely closely to one another, but without colliding. In the Lagrange point situated between both black holes is the likely source of SCP-6713-A: a true vacuum generated by the decay of a metastable false vacuum from unpredictable, yet artificial changes to the energy levels of the Higgs boson. [[footnote]] Mainstream physics and The Standard Model define the Higgs boson as an elementary particle whose field gives mass to quarks and other subatomic particles, which is necessary for the formation of matter, and by extension, life. Unlike other fields, the Higgs field is not stable, but metastable, meaning it does not exist in its lowest possible energy state, which it could spontaneously decay into at any time by an extremely improbable quantum tunneling event or sufficient energy input. [[/footnote]] 

**Discovery:** SCP-6713 was first discovered on August 7, 2017 by astronomers at the Keck Observatory in Mauna Kea, Hawaii, following the sudden detection of large amounts of matter and heat near the inner bounds of the vacuum. Foundation personnel embedded within the observatory soon seized control of the facility before administering amnestics to the staff stationed there and laying them off. Researchers later determined that a normally extremely improbable fluctuation of trillions of quantum particles was responsible for the detection of matter in SCP-6713-A, causing the particles to spontaneously configure into a large star cluster dubbed the &#34;Boltzmann Cluster&#34;. [[footnote]] Named after German scientist Ludwig Boltzmann, who coined the concept of the &#34;Boltzmann Brain&#34; -- a thought experiment which states that, given enough time, a human brain with false memories can and will emerge spontaneously in a void through the random configuration of particles via quantum tunneling. Physicist Sean Carroll has since expanded the concept to stars, planets, and even entire galaxies, all out of random chance. [[/footnote]] The Foundation continued to observe the cluster until it randomly vanished from existence a mere ten days after its creation. 

Since SCP-6713&#39;s discovery, the Foundation has registered 13,120 different anomalous &#34;Boltzmann Events&#34; occurring within its interior, ranging from the very minor to those involving alterations to standard Hume levels on a cosmic scale.

An abridged summary of some of the most significant &#34;Boltzmann Events&#34; is listed below: 

||~ Date of Event ||~ Description of Event ||~ Duration of Event ||~ Notes ||
|| 3/17/2018 || A second star cluster composed of five thousand supergiant stars is observed spontaneously popping into existence, before each star goes supernova. || 15 minutes || The event attracted the attention of the mainstream scientific community due to its statistical rarity, but Foundation agents successfully ran a disinformation campaign explaining that the novas were actually flares or alternatively a product of sheer coincidence. //(Luckily for us, it was St. Patrick&#39;s Day!)// --Dr. Reed||
|| 5/13/2018    || Foundation telescopes detect a drastic, abrupt shift in the ambient temperature of SCP-6713-A from its initial temperature of 1000 degrees Kelvin to near absolute zero (0K) in less than a second. The vacuum immediately collapses into a massive Bose-Einstein condensate[[footnote]] A state of matter in which bosons and particles occupy the lowest thermodynamically possible energy state, becoming waves with very little energy. [[/footnote]], resulting in a ultracold &#34;liquid Universe&#34; full of hydrogen and helium existing in states resembling supercritical fluids. No stars or planets are visible. || Approx. 2 months ||  ||
|| 7/25/2018    || SCP-6713-A&#39;s ambient temperature drastically changes again, increasing from 0K to over 10^^23^^ Kelvin in exactly four minutes. This causes SCP-6713-A&#39;s interior to transform into an ultradense, ultrahot quark-gluon plasma[[footnote]] The opposite of a Bose-Einstein condensate, where particles occupy such a high energy state under extremely hot temperatures, and are so dense that atomic bonds and the formation of matter are not possible. [[/footnote]] inhospitable to life. || 7.5 days || Following SCP-6713-A&#39;s transition to this state, it slowly cooled back to a state more conducive to the formation of planets, stars, and galaxies. ||
|| 4/30/2019    || Various pockets of spacetime in SCP-6713-A experience chaotic, unpredictable fluctuations in the strength of the strong nuclear force, ranging from being several times weaker than in our Universe, to being hundreds of times stronger. Galaxies, black holes, solar systems, planets, and atoms spontaneously disintegrate, then evaporate into subatomic particles in some areas, while in others, they all collapse into high-energy singularities of infinite mass before imploding. SCP-6713-A remains dark for months following this event. || 3 weeks ||  ||
|| 11/23/2019  || SCP-6713-A is spontaneously filled with liquid water following a rapid increase in the vacuum&#39;s amount of free hydrogen and oxygen atoms, and the disappearance of helium from its periodic table. This newly formed &#34;cosmic ocean&#34; / &#34;Boltzmann Sea&#34; acts as a fertile breeding ground for massive Universe-spanning aquatic ecosystems, whose life signs are immediately detected by researchers. Bioluminescent cnidarian organisms of varying sizes glow brightly in the darkness in the place of stars and galaxies, while planets become inverted pockets of air sealed tight by the water pressure of the sea surrounding them, or home to large &#34;stellar reefs&#34; and large &#34;planet crabs&#34; that utilize planets and moons as shells. Space is teeming with leviathans and other enormous aquatic entities often several astronomical units (AUs) or light years in length. Quantum tunneling soon destroys this rich environment, however: a rapid change in gravity causes all life forms to be stretched into oblivion. || 8 hours || Researchers noted that this manifestation of SCP-6713-A appeared to exhibit extreme time dilation, to the extent that subjective perception of time diverged radically between observers outside the bubble vs. hypothetical subjects inside the bubble. Dr. Reed has theorized that every hour within our Universe was the equivalent of one billion years within SCP-6713-A before its inevitable destruction, citing the length of time it would be expected to take for life to form in a similarly suitable cosmos. Interestingly, researchers also observed that some of the bioluminescent life forms present in this iteration of SCP-6713-A appeared to be flickering their lights on and off at //nonrandom// intervals, suggesting that they may, in fact, have been using a form of Morse Code in an attempt to communicate with our Universe.|| 
|| 6/8/2020      || The force of gravity rapidly strengthens within SCP-6713-A, overpowering dark energy and resulting in a collapse of the void, before the void rebounds into a new configuration full of not only degenerate matter, but also dozens of unknown heavy elements not present in our baseline Universe&#39;s periodic table. Despite the exceptionally high atomic numbers and masses of these elements, the conditions of the Universe within this newly formed vacuum allowed them to remain much more stable than they normally would in our reality, before disintegrating. Curiously, //light// elements with low atomic masses (such as hydrogen, helium, and lithium) were extremely unstable in this iteration of SCP-6713, in contrast to our reality, where heavy elements tend to be unstable. || 1 day || Notably, the elements detected in SCP-6713-A had atomic numbers ranging from 119 to 936. ||
|| 10/21/2020   || 78% of all supermassive black holes in SCP-6713-A suddenly change into white holes, causing billions of stars to be ejected from their orbits and the dissolution of several million galaxies. Many of the stars collide with one another, resulting in massive explosions that leave cosmic gas behind. The elemental composition of the void is then altered again, resulting in molecular clouds that form stars made of boron and xenon gas, rather than hydrogen gas. Eventually, the vacuum cools and darkens. || 1 month and four days ||  || 
|| 12/12/2020   || The colors orange, yellow, and blue cease to exist in the ultraviolet spectrum. 12% of all stars within SCP-6713-A inexplicably &#34;greenshift&#34;, &#34;pinkshift&#34; or &#34;purpleshift&#34; towards their respective colors, while another 25% turn into dead iron stars unable to release heat. All other stars stretch into or assume various non-spherical forms, turning into a) cubes, b) pyramids, c) flat two-dimensional &#34;pancakes&#34;, d) cylinders, or e) amoeboid amorphous shapes, before being annihilated in random intervals. || 47 seconds || At least 130 galaxies and fifty star clusters were also observed assuming shapes resembling thaumaturgic symbols.[[footnote]] See the Addendum on the Poincare Event for more information. [[/footnote]] ||
|| 8/27/2021      || Five massive galaxy cluster sized biological entities resembling giant cephalopods and bleeding [DATA EXPUNGED] randomly emerge in the Northern Hemisphere of SCP-6713-A before disappearing in a flash of light. After this event SCP-6713-A&#39;s ratio of matter vs. antimatter particles suddenly transitions from being asymmetrical to being perfectly symmetrical, causing the vacuum to once again collapse from the mutual annihilation of its particle-antiparticle pairs. || 13 seconds || High levels of X-ray emissions originating from the entities, upon being converted to sound, reveal they were screaming. ||
|| 9/2/2021     || The fine structure constant[[footnote]] A dimensionless physical constant of the Universe that determines the strength of the interaction between electromagnetically charged elementary particles. If this value were any higher or lower than approx. 1/137, matter and life would likely not form and stellar fusion would be impossible [[/footnote]] within SCP-6713-A changes value by 4.8%, eliminating the presence of carbon within SCP-6713-A. 67% of all baryonic matter then spontaneously switches into exotic matter exhibiting properties such as negative mass, resulting in runaway self-accelerating motion between galaxies containing both baryonic and exotic matter, which proceed to grow at an exponential rate without end. Traces of silicon dioxide are detected in the intergalactic void, which spontaneously coalesce into asteroid fields seemingly capable of moving on their own in defiance of gravity. || 6 months || This configuration of SCP-6713-A later retroactively phased into a reality in which mass as a concept no longer existed, creating an empty void once again with no planets, stars, or life forms. ||
|| 1/15/2022       || Incident 6713-A-1 occurs. A gargantuan galaxy-cluster sized replica of SCP-096 randomly emerges in a flash of light directly in the line of sight of the vast majority of the world&#39;s astronomical observatories and radio/space telescopes, including the Hubble and James Webb telescopes. Foundation personnel stationed across the globe, including individuals embedded in various cybersecurity agencies and hacker groups immediately initiate Operation Blindspot, forcing a mass shutdown of all space camera systems, satellites, and radio telescopes pointed towards SCP-096 to protect humanity from its cognitohazardous effects, while utilizing webcrawlers to monitor the Internet for any pictures of SCP-096 uploaded online for deletion. No images are detected. In the hours and days following this event, aerosolized Class A amnestics are deployed by Foundation fighter jets over large population zones, and a cover-up story is disseminated across mass media blaming the aforementioned global shutdown on a moderately powerful coronal mass ejection (CME) from the Sun. The operation is a success. || 34 minutes  || //I knew SCP-6713 was capable of producing astronomically improbable events, but I never thought we&#39;d be unlucky enough to see it create SCPs from &#34;nothing&#34;.

I propose we change SCP-6713&#39;s classification from Keter to Apollyon immediately. We need to do something about 6713 before it spawns something else that could kill us all.// --Site Director Briggs, in a conversation with O-5 members. ||

**Addendum 6713.01-- PROJECT HEAVENPIERCER:** 

On January 16, 2022, all members of the O5 Council met for an emergency voting session following Incident 6713-A-1 and the success of Operation Blindspot. After a vote of 9-3 in favor of investigating SCP-6713, the Council authorized the initiation of Phase 1 of Project HEAVENPIERCER: the construction and launch of a large unmanned deep space exploration probe also named SCPS //Heavenpiercer//. To counteract the chaotic environment of SCP-6713-A, it was decided that the probe would be fitted with several Scranton Reality Anchors capable of generating a bubble of stable reality potent enough to allow the probe to feasibly traverse the boundary separating our Universe from SCP-6713-A, and travel to the source of the anomaly without being destroyed by random ontological alterations. 

It was also determined that the probe would contain indirect sensory equipment and specially designed cameras designed to automatically trigger an anticognitohazard program, then shut off in the event of a cognitohazardous Boltzmann Event, a wormhole drive (to shorten the probe&#39;s travel distance to SCP-6713), and a trans-Universal communication array (to enable instantaneous contact between the //Heavenpiercer// and the Foundation while still maintaining sub-light speeds) utilizing similar processes as the aforementioned wormhole drive[[footnote]] Microscopic, atomic-scale wormholes at the Planck scale. [[/footnote]].

A timeline outlining the events of Project HEAVENPIERCER can be viewed below: 

+++ [Begin Expedition Log]

**1/10/2022**: Planning and construction of the SCPS //Heavenpiercer// begins immediately, a process greatly accelerated through the usage of specialized artificial intelligence. Neither the public nor any world government nor front companies involved in transporting and assembling materials, nor members of the Foundation below Level 5 clearance are notified of this project in its entirety, with disparate groups informed of only small aspects of the project in question. 

**3/9/2022**: SCPS //Heavenpiercer// is 99% complete. Preparations for its launch in Cape Canaveral, Florida are made for the following month. 

**4/18/2022, 2:50:00 AM UTC**: SCPS //Heavenpiercer// is launched into Earth&#39;s orbit without incident and remotely moved to the far side of the Moon by Foundation Mission Control operatives. O5 Command watches the launch through the probe&#39;s rear facing cameras, and sees the Earth shrinking, then disappearing as the probe approaches and completes one orbit around the Moon.  

**4/18/2022, 2:58:00 AM UTC**: SCPS //Heavenpiercer// activates its wormhole drive, creating a traversable wormhole/Einstein-Rosen/Morris-Thorne bridge allowing it to reach SCP-6713-A in just a few months while still traveling at sub-light speeds. The probe begins to glow before phasing through the wormhole and vanishing. Contact with the probe is lost for the duration of the journey to SCP-6713-A, partly due to the newly created wormhole, and partly due to relativistic effects brought about by the vessel traveling not only hundreds of millions of light years in distance, but hundreds of millions of light years back in time. 

**6/11/2022, 11:19:00 PM UTC**: SCPS //Heavenpiercer// decelerates, arriving at its destination near SCP-6713-A. O5 Council members are notified of the probe&#39;s arrival, and order the activation of its Scranton Reality Anchors. Spacetime begins to bend around the probe before the Hume levels of the developing pocket dimension encasing the probe stabilize into a state of equilibrium, enveloping the vessel within a bubble. The probe then moves towards the expanding vacuum in front of it, successfully passing through the boundary of ionized radiation separating our Universe from SCP-6713-A without being annihilated. Contact is temporarily lost again with the probe as it enters another wormhole that will bring it within a few dozen light years of the center of SCP-6713-A. 

**6/24/2022, 8:30:00 PM UTC**: The Foundation re-establishes contact with SCPS //Heavenpiercer// after it emerges from its second wormhole jump, directing it to take measurements of the surrounding void, and monitor its surroundings for Boltzmann Events as it slowly approaches the center (and source) of the anomaly. At this time, the probe, is approx. 93 light years away from the center of SCP-6713-A. In the distance it detects what appears to be an exceptionally bright star emanating powerful gravitational waves that send massive ripples across spacetime. 

**6/27/2022, 10:19:05 AM UTC**: A moderately severe Boltzmann Event is recorded by the SCPS //Heavenpiercer// that causes SCP-6713-A to transform into an inverted sphere full of fractals. Geometrically impossible Escher-like three dimensional and higher dimensional polytopes appear and disappear within minutes of each other, and the //Heavenpiercer//&#39;s sensory instruments detect an extreme shift in SCP-6713-A&#39;s Hume levels to 0.02. Though the probe is unaffected, it automatically shuts its cameras down seconds into the Boltzmann Event out of precaution. No cognitohazards are reported. The event ends after exactly 28.6 minutes, permitting //Heavenpiercer// to activate its camera feeds once more. The probe is now within 80 light years of its destination. 

**6/29/2022, 6:28:14 PM UTC**: SCPS //Heavenpiercer// continues its trajectory towards the center of SCP-6713-A for the next several days, before it records yet another Boltzmann Event in its vicinity. The void begins to fill up with iridescent balls of slime that randomly and rapidly flash between a series of imperceptible &#34;impossible colors&#34;. The probe shuts down its cameras again only to crash into numerous walls and shards of &#34;black glass&#34; that appear at random intervals, causing fragments of the &#34;glass&#34; to fly everywhere in all directions. Mission Control is forced to decelerate the probe to wait out the Boltzmann Event, sending a minor shock wave across deep space. This Boltzmann Event ends in two hours, but is then immediately followed by another, much more severe Boltzmann Event. SCP-6713-A changes state again just after //Heavenpiercer// resumes its course, this time reconfiguring itself into a purely linguistic, semiotic cosmos. Thousands of both unrecognizable and recognizable flaming thaumaturgic symbols, letters, ciphers, and hieroglyphics either rapidly flicker from one symbol to another or randomly burst into being in random locations surrounding the probe, forming words and sometimes whole coherent sentences that disintegrate as quickly as they integrate. This reality created by SCP-6713-A is vaporized in 6.2 minutes.

//Note: Approximately 1% of the sentences seen in the video footage were successfully translated by Foundation cryptographers, stating phrases like &#34;We&#39;re sorry&#34;, &#34;It&#39;s all our fault&#34;, &#34;Please help us&#34;, &#34;Redeem us&#34; or &#34;Save us&#34;.//

**7/1/2022, 3:09:11 PM UTC**: SCPS //Heavenpiercer// is 50 light years away from SCP-6713-B, now definitively confirmed to be the source of SCP-6713-A&#39;s anomalous properties. The probe continues to receive gravitational wave readings that grow gradually stronger and more intense the closer it travels to the center of the vacuum, born out of SCP-6713-B&#39;s binary black hole. Photographs taken by the probe clearly show the silhouette of an artificial dodecahedral object surrounded by a massive accretion disk and a severe distortion of spacetime, causing extreme gravitational lensing due to the scattering of light coming from stars and galaxies directly behind the megastructure. This lensing causes the light behind SCP-6713-B to appear as an Einstein ring. 

**7/4/2022, 5:34:12 AM UTC**: Visual contact with //Heavenpiercer// is lost for approximately 13 hours, though Foundation researchers are able to confirm its continued existence and operational status using radio signals and indirect sensory data being sent back to Earth from the location of the probe. The probe&#39;s cameras during this segment of time show only a black screen. However, loud wailing, weeping, and screeching can be heard coming from seemingly all directions at once throughout the void. The echoes and screams grow progressively louder and louder until the //Heavenpiercer// begins to violently oscillate, despite the presence of its Scranton Reality Anchors, before the event abruptly ends at the 13 hour mark. A third Boltzmann event is theorized to have been the cause of the loss of //Heavenpiercer//&#39;s visual feed, though the conditions of the new reality the probe found itself in are unclear. It is believed by both Dr. Reed and Dr. Johnson that SCP-6713-A&#39;s most recent Boltzmann Event created a purely aural, tonal, or auditory reality in which visuality or visual perception has ceased to exist, though other researchers, such as Senior Researcher Dr. Yamada think otherwise: 

&gt; //With all due respect, Director, what Dr. Reed and Dr. Johnson have proposed is preposterous. If their hypothesis is true, our probe should have been vaporized into its constituent atoms a long time ago. What&#39;s really going on here is very simple: the new &#34;July 4th&#34; reality created by SCP-6713-A was a reality where light, as opposed to visual perception or optics as a branch of physics, no longer existed. It explains why we still knew Heavenpiercer was in one piece despite us not being able to physically see it--there just wasn&#39;t any light around for us to check. For all intents and purposes, Heavenpiercer became a quasi-invisible black hole in the span of about 20 minutes!// --Dr. Yamada, in a conversation with Site Director Briggs and Head of Research Dr. Carter. 

**7/5/2022, 1:45:56 PM UTC**: SCPS //Heavenpiercer// arrives within 20 light years of SCP-6713-B. More and more gravitational, temporal, and spatial anomalies are detected by the probe due to its close distance to the megastructure at the center of the vacuum. The probe once again begins to oscillate due to its wormhole growing unstable, as it is ever so slightly pulled towards SCP-6713-B, whose gargantuan size gives the object its own gravitational pull (exacerbated by its own binary black hole). By 11:00:00 PM UTC the probe has come within 12 light years of its destination, and begins to decelerate in preparation for its exit from its wormhole. Significant tensile stress on the //Heavenpiercer// causes both its electronic equipment and its Scranton Reality Anchors to exhibit reduced functional capability, as it is slowly crushed by anomalous physical laws.   

**7/6/2022, 4:00:18 AM UTC**: SCPS //Heavenpiercer// emerges from its second wormhole jump, and comes within 8 light years of SCP-6713-B, then 7 light years, then 6, then 5. It continues to oscillate with greater and greater intensity as the onboard cameras blink on and off, sometimes blacking out for several minutes at a time. Some members of O5 begin to doubt the durability of the //Heavenpiercer//, as well as its ability to withstand the titanic forces being exuded by SCP-6713-B, while others remain determined and steadfast. Photos taken from the probe at this time become increasingly blurry and murky, possibly due to magnetic interference from the binary black hole system at the center of SCP-6713-B (which is itself at least 2 AU in diameter). //Heavenpiercer//&#39;s Scranton Reality Anchors start to malfunction, first only very infrequently, then periodically, weakening the strength of its stabilizing Hume field.

&gt; //We fitted this probe with the toughest substances known to humankind AND three Reality Anchors to boot. Neither they nor the probe came cheap. If this mission doesn&#39;t succeed, we&#39;ll have no choice but to discontinue Phase 2 of the Project. O-4, O-10, and O-11 say we have to try something, because it&#39;s better than doing nothing. I think that something should take the form of getting as many people off this reality as possible within the next century. We can&#39;t stop this thing from swallowing up our Universe, so we might as well try the next best thing.// --O-6

**7/6/2022, 9:17:39 AM UTC**: SCPS //Heavenpiercer// reaches a distance of 4 light years from SCP-6713-B. 

**7/6/2022, 1:24:02 PM UTC**: SCPS //Heavenpiercer// reaches a distance of 3.5 light years from SCP-6713-B. The visual feed from the probe grows fuzzy as many of its auxiliary systems, such as its spectrometer and other sensory equipment, are forced offline. Internal computers report significant levels of external stress on the probe as well as rising levels of gamma radiation coming from the black holes inside of SCP-6713-B. 

**7/6/2022, 10:59:48 PM UTC**: SCPS //Heavenpiercer// reaches a distance of 2 light years from SCP-6713-B. Its Scranton Reality Anchors begin to fail, losing up to 70% of their original stabilizing capabilities. At least one of the probe&#39;s protruding antennae break off from its main body. Its wormhole drive, and by extension its communications array, also exhibit reduced functionality (down by at least 65%). 

**7/7/2022, 3:30:21 AM UTC**: SCPS //Heavenpiercer// comes within less than 1 light year of SCP-6713-B, taking a small number of low-resolution images of the megastructure. Moments later, its camera feeds begin to display static and white noise, while its internal computers report //Heavenpiercer// has reached a critical state, and is on the verge of total mechanical failure. Soon after, all Scranton Reality Anchors in the probe crash simultaneously while its propulsion systems short circuit. A powerful explosion is detected with the probe not long after, causing it to change direction and drift aimlessly towards SCP-6713-B, as it is pushed at an angle by a leak of exotic matter particles. O5 Command and Mission Control deduce from the few sensors remaining in operation on the probe that it is headed on a one-way collision course with SCP-6713-B&#39;s accretion disk, should its trajectory remain unaltered. Eventually, contact can no longer be established with the probe once the aforementioned sensors finally shut down. The destruction of the //Heavenpiercer// at this point is all but assured. Most O5 members, seeing these developments, are left with little option but to declare Project HEAVENPIERCER a failure, and order Mission Control to abort the exploration of SCP-6713. 

**Addendum 6713.02-- POINCARE RECURRENCE EVENT:**

**7/7/2022, 3:33:33 AM UTC**: Just as Mission Control is about to pull the plug on //Heavenpiercer//, Incident 6713-A-2 occurs (the Poincare Recurrence Event), much to the shock of all Foundation personnel still observing the probe&#39;s video logs (showing a black screen once again). At random intervals, //Heavenpiercer//&#39;s video feeds jolt back to life as it continues to gradually float towards SCP-6713-B, though its other pieces of equipment remain dysfunctional. In the distance, SCP-6713-B can be seen in perfect clarity, its various markings on its dodecahedral shells easily legible even from a great distance. Detecting motion to its immediate right, however, //Heavenpiercer// automatically turns its cameras towards the same direction. 

The resulting video feed reveals the presence of thousands of spacecraft of varying sizes and shapes, either in pieces or in states of disrepair, alongside dozens of mechanical extraterrestrial entities resembling crustaceans drifting in the empty vacuum[[footnote]] Not as they existed in the present moment, but as they existed hundreds of millions of light years ago, long before the birth of humanity. [[/footnote]]. Notably, these entities possess tri-radial or trilaterally symmetric body plans (three chelae with three claws rather than two chelae with two claws, and three eyestalks rather than two), unlike crustaceans on Earth. The entities, apparently in a state of hibernation, &#34;wake up&#34; from their slumber, and notice the probe before immediately coalescing into a large swarm, and approaching it, seemingly in a rush to do so. 

The entities stop moving just in front of the probe and carefully envelop it. Five seconds later, //Heavenpiercer//&#39;s onboard computers begin receiving several yottabytes of information that they were not designed to handle. To prevent a catastrophic data overflow error, or mitigate further damage to its internal electronic equipment, the //Heavenpiercer// probe uses its wormhole communications array (now back online) to automatically redirect incoming data from its processing modules to ground-based computers on Earth in the form of compressed data packets. From there, they are uploaded into secure and encrypted offline data centers. Following this event, the alien entities release the //Heavenpiercer// from their clutches, and look directly at its onboard cameras at close range. 

//Heavenpiercer//&#39;s cameras attempt to shut down and deploy their anticognitohazard program after identifying the entities as a potential threat, but an unexpected glitch in the probe&#39;s software temporarily delays its normal anticognitohazard procedures. As a result, all individuals viewing the alien entities, from some members of the O-5 to personnel at Mission Control, are telepathically bombarded with images and messages into their minds, causing them collapse out of mental exhaustion or break out into weeping and screaming fits. On-site medics and operatives arrive on the scene a short time later, sedating and amnesticizing all affected personnel before bringing them into emergency care. 

+++ [End Expedition Log]

Approximately 4 hours after this event, affected personnel wake up one by one from their previous states and gradually assume normal baseline behavior. Some operatives awaken with minor headaches, but otherwise are in good physical health. Below is a transcript of a private conversation that took place between O-6 and O-11 later that same day (notably, both of them were among the few O5 Council members not completely defenseless against minor cognitohazards). 

+++ **Begin Transcript (7/7/2022, 8:08:00 PM UTC):**

&gt; //Extraneous information has been edited out for clarity.//
&gt; 
&gt; **O-6:** So, it&#39;s just the two of us? 
&gt; 
&gt; **O-11**: I&#39;m afraid so. Everyone is just now starting to recover from the cognitohazard they were exposed to, though the amnestics in their systems means they&#39;ll be out of commission for a while. 
&gt; 
&gt; **O-6:** Did you see the messages? The ones beamed into our minds?
&gt; 
&gt; **O-11**: Yes, I did. They were...disturbing, to say the least. Seeing what those entities did to themselves, to the Universe they lived in, the regret, the shame, the suffering...no wonder some people broke out into tears. They were trying to warn us, trying to protect us. 
&gt; 
&gt; **O-6**: What about the probe? I heard it--
&gt; 
&gt; **O-11**: Came back to our Universe, yes. In a wormhole apparently created by the entities themselves, and in perfect condition too. We managed to retrieve it from low-Earth orbit and bring it to HQ for analysis. I&#39;m still struggling to understand how exactly everything went down because Mission Control doesn&#39;t have enough data at this point, but I think we just got lucky. Like, astronomically, unbelievably lucky. So lucky we just so happened to be at the right place at the right time against all odds. Do you get me?
&gt; 
&gt; **O-6**: Sorta. SCP-6713 is a probabilistic anomaly after all, where anything can happen inside it, no matter how insane. 
&gt; 
&gt; **O-11**: But that&#39;s just it, O-6. //Anything// can occur within 6713 even if the odds of that phenomena occurring in our reality is extremely close to zero-- that is to say, infinitesimally improbable. You might think I&#39;m nuts for saying this, but I think //Heavenpiercer// underwent yet another Boltzmann Event, one that spontaneously //reversed or decreased entropy// on a large, though still local scale, causing all damage the probe endured to be undone in mere moments. //Ordo Ab Chao//.[[footnote]] &#34;Out of chaos, comes order&#34; or &#34;Order out of chaos&#34; in Latin. [[/footnote]] Nothing&#39;s confirmed as of yet, but that&#39;s my theory. 
&gt; 
&gt; **O-6**: But that&#39;s against the laws of thermodynamics. That shouldn&#39;t be possible under our current understanding of physics in our Universe, at least on a cosmic scale. 
&gt; 
&gt; **O-11**: Yes, true. But remember, that&#39;s //in our Universe//, O-6, not the pocket reality within SCP-6713. Over there, the laws of physics, and even logic itself are in a constant state of flux. If there was ever a place that could be defined as truly random, as truly chaotic, that region of space would be it. And we just so happened to hit the goddamn jackpot. 
&gt; 
&gt; **O-6**: At this point I&#39;m willing to accept anything--your thoughts sound quite plausible, if not outlandish. Do you think that explains the aliens? They died by their own hand eons ago, only to come back from nonexistence purely by statistical fluke, memories from a previous reality intact and all. So I guess the reversal of entropy affected this &#34;Boltzmann Civilization&#34; too. 
&gt; 
&gt; **O-11**: Could be either that, or the Poincare Recurrence Theorem in action. Maybe even both phenomena at once. 
&gt; 
&gt; **O-6**: I&#39;ve heard of that theorem. The one that states that, given an extremely long, but still finite amount of time, any system will eventually return to a state very similar to, or exactly the same as their initial state. Reminds me of what Nietzsche said--that all of reality is destined to repeat itself over and over in a cycle.
&gt; 
&gt; **O-11**: Correct. And it took billions, if not trillions of years for the entities (from their perspective) to come back, to return to their initial state before their ultimate annihilation eons ago. Tragically, you remember what happened to them only 13.7 minutes later. 
&gt; 
&gt; **O-6**: Don&#39;t remind me, O-11. Being stretched and spaghettified across time and space is one of the worst ways to go. They had just enough time to communicate with us, to send our probe back to our reality with relative ease before all hell broke loose. I still can&#39;t get over the screams in my head, hearing their consciousnesses once again be slowly ripped apart and distributed across spacetime. There are few fates worse than being tortured for hundreds of millions, if not //billions// of years in a bubble of reality you created for yourself--a bubble inextricably bound with the collective consciousness of your species. 
&gt; 
&gt; [There is a long pause before O-6 speaks again].
&gt; 
&gt; **O-6**: So, what do we do now? I suppose we can try Phase 2 of Project Heavenpiercer, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth it. You saw what happened with //Heavenpiercer//. I still think we should prioritize getting off this doomed Universe since there&#39;s clearly no stopping SCP-6713. Who knows? Perhaps the Universe next door doesn&#39;t have any anomalies or eldritch horrors waiting to destroy us! Unfortunately, our technology is limited to travel //within// our reality, not outside of it, and we only have so much time before that vacuum approaches our galaxy and destroys it. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to make it, O-11.
&gt; 
&gt; **O-11**: That&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong, O-6. 
&gt; 
&gt; **O-6**: What do you mean? 
&gt; 
&gt; **O-11**: Remember the data the aliens sent us? The packets our ground computers picked up from //Heavenpiercer//? Well, researchers have been combing through all the information, and they&#39;ve found everything from star charts, written messages[[footnote]] See Addendum 6713-A-3 (6713.03) for specific details [[/footnote]], and schematics for engineering projects, to new mathematical equations. One of these equations apparently proves inter-universal travel is not only possible, but easily achievable, though a practical, working propulsion system capable of doing this was apparently too complicated for even the SCP-6713 entities to create, at least at their stage of development. Perhaps they were wiped out just before they could build one of those things. 
&gt; 
&gt; **O-6**: So there&#39;s still a chance for us to escape our fate?  
&gt; 
&gt; **O-11**: A tiny but non-zero one, O-6. Remember, even in our Universe, nothing is truly impossible. If we start working hard now, we should have just enough time to escape our galaxy and our Universe before SCP-6713 swallows it up. 
&gt; 
&gt; **O-6**: Then there&#39;s no time to spare. Should we alert the Church of the Second Hytoth, and the Ortothan religion?
&gt; 
&gt; **O-11**: I don&#39;t know, and I&#39;m not sure how they would react.  If we could see SCP-6713 and all the shit it spawned, they obviously could see it too. Some of them probably know or have already arrived at the truth, but have chosen not to acknowledge it, either out of fear of being persecuted for &#34;heresy&#34; or &#34;apostasy&#34; or simply out of delusion. If there are extraterrestrials who recognize the situation we&#39;re all in, they&#39;re either long gone from this reality, or are preparing to leave well in advance. It behooves us to follow suit. The End Times really are upon us.
&gt; 
&gt; **O-6**: How will the Foundation maintain the Veil throughout all this? At some point, //someone// outside the Foundation is going to find out the truth, and catch us with our pants down. It&#39;s not a matter of if we&#39;ll be exposed, but //when//. 
&gt; 
&gt; **O-11**: We&#39;ll cross that bridge when we get to it, O-6. Last I heard the Administrator&#39;s expressed doubts about the continued feasibility of maintaining its policy of secrecy from the rest of the world, especially after Incident 6713-A-1. To be honest, I kind of agree with him. The Foundation can only do so much with all the resources we have, and as much as we&#39;d like to think we have things under control, the reality it is we often don&#39;t, at least some of the time. The world, as a wise man, once said, is rudderless, drifting about with no captain of the ship and no clear destination. If the entities in SCP-6713 couldn&#39;t control their own creation or the events of their Universe, how can we expect to do so in ours? Think about that. Some things are simply beyond our grasp, beyond our ability to understand, and as much as we aspire to understand as much of reality as possible, reality itself may be too complex and too intricate for us to ever fully comprehend. Godel came to that implicit conclusion decades ago, when he published his Incompleteness Theorems. 
&gt; 
&gt; **O-6**: //Sigh//. Deep down, I know you&#39;re right, O-11. But I can&#39;t bring myself to accept it. 
&gt; 
&gt; //(Following this, O-6 gets up and turns to leave the room he and O-11 met up in)//. 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ve had enough philosophy and physics for one day. I&#39;m going home to gulp down some brandy. You want some?

**Addendum 6713.03-- PRIDE COMETH BEFORE DESTRUCTION:**

On 7/9/2022, Foundation researchers analyzing the information sent to data centers by the //Heavenpiercer// during its encounter with the SCP-6713 entities uncovered several data artifacts of indeterminate age, none of which were cognitohazardous. One of these artifacts appeared to be an image file depicting the Cosmic Microwave Background, not of our present Universe, but an apparent previous Universe or iteration of reality that was originally the home of the extraterrestrial entities within SCP-6713-A. 

After several hours of analysis, Dr. Reed determined that the image was actually //not// a random configuration of hot and cold spots in the temperature of the cosmos, but an //artificially created data matrix// in which binary code was encoded through the ordered alternation between cosmic hot spots and cold spots in the entities&#39; home Universe (0s are represented by cold spots / tiny regions of lower ambient temperature in the Universe, while 1s are represented by warmer spots of higher temperature).[[footnote]] //This is the dominant theory we have thus far, but it is equally possible this artificial CMB came from the same iteration of SCP-6713-A that spawned the Poincare Recurrence Event. The Heavenpiercer, after all, recorded a Hume level in the negative as it was being carried by the aliens it came into contact with. This would explain why the aliens were able to create a wormhole so easily, and perhaps spontaneously control the ambient temperature of SCP-6713-A to create the CMB image, then feed that information into the probe.// --Dr. Yamada  [[/footnote]] 

Upon making this discovery, Dr. Reed alerted Senior Researcher Dr. Yamada of his findings. Upon realizing the implications of the image, she alerted Head of Research Dr. Carter, who stared at the data matrix with a mixture of awe, surprise, and terror. The both of them soon had the file transferred and analyzed by a decoder/decryption program, which, due to the image&#39;s large size, was a process that took many hours to complete. 

After over 9 hours of processing, the decoder finally finished translating the CMB image into letters and numbers. The result was a fragmented message, addressed to seemingly all inhabitants of our current Universe (and future Universes), followed by an exhaustive history of the entities that appeared before the //Heavenpiercer// inside SCP-6713-A. 

Below are relevant pieces of the aforementioned message reproduced for viewing. Several words and phrases could not be translated due to mild/moderate data or syntax corruption:
