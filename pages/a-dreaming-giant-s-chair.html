Standing proud and silent in Eryri[[footnote]] Let&#39;s not lose such beautiful names to Anglicising. - //M.Y.// [[/footnote]], is the mountain known as Cadair Idris. Should a pilgrim or hiker sleep upon its soil alone, they will be subjected to a lucid dream, in which a Way will open with their minds. These dreams, depending on intent, can bring great inspiration, enlightenment and insight or madness and never-ending tiredness[[footnote]] I don&#39;t know which is worse. - //N.N.// [[/footnote]].

**Knowledge**
[[/=]]

**Traits:** Those who practice the arts of magic regularly or are familiar with its touch, will feel a slight stillness when walking across the mountain&#39;s rocks. This stillness will change to feelings of calm and admiration when a flower from the mountain&#39;s soil is held. A few witnesses have even claimed they hear a man singing before laying down to sleep.

The experience itself is quite simple to enact, so long as you are aware of the existence of the Library[[footnote]] Given who we are, that shouldn&#39;t be a problem. - //M.Y.// [[/footnote]]. Find a decent spot to camp[[footnote]] I&#39;d recommend right next to Llyn Cau. It&#39;s a beautiful spot. - //[[[dr-dafydd-s-personnel-file|Z.D.]]]// [[/footnote]], as you don&#39;t want to wake up in the middle of the act. Before settling down, make sure you&#39;re holding a Snowdon lily, wildly grown. Without one, the ritual is incomplete and the connection cannot be established. Also, note that induced sleep will not result in a connection, so make sure you&#39;re ready for bed.

**Nature:** The ritual is, on the face of it, quite easy to begin. Be warned, however, that you are connecting with the Library in a more personal way than if you were just visiting it physically. You&#39;re allowing a part of yourself, a part of your soul, to join with the Library. So you must be doing this both willingly and respectfully.

Just like the Serpent themselves, the ritual will know if you&#39;ve got ill intentions. Those claims of madness and tiredness are no joke. The slightest hint of greed, malice or betrayal, unconscious or not, and you&#39;ll risk having to face years of wakeful nights. And that&#39;s the best outcome in that case[[footnote]] Remember Cherry Pip? Her screams just got louder and louder. - //M.Y.// [[/footnote]].

The ritual&#39;s Loyalty is one of Competence. It takes honesty, a desire for wisdom and vulnerability.

**History &amp; Associated Parties:** Part of this ritual and its results is well known in Welsh folklore and tourism, resulting in the location being a common site for hikes, birdwatching and photography. Many &#34;Neo-Druids&#34; and &#34;Occultists&#34;[[footnote]] Basically, those who tend to look for things in all the wrong places. - //C.T.// [[/footnote]] have indulged and exaggerated the tale, to fan their own fancies. Most tales claim that the mountain was once the home of a giant called Idris. Idris was great in mind as he was in size. A great philosopher, horticulturalist and astronomer, he would sit on the mountain, which later took his name, and contemplate the curiosities and puzzles of the world.

Whilst the true origin of the ritual is lost to the lower hall of the Library, the most accurate depiction of its origin and fruition can be found in the lost pages of //Y Gododdin//. According to pages, Idirs was one of the last giants and a scholar of the great witch and [[[nx-02|Mabyn]]], Ceridwen[[footnote]] An old friend and skilled poet. Her loss was hard. - //Nahash.// [[/footnote]]. Through her, he managed to achieve access to the Library through oneiric union.

**Approach:** As said, this ritual&#39;s performance is the easy part. Just make sure you&#39;re in the right state of tiredness and have the flower at ready[[footnote]] How it was grown doesn&#39;t matter. Just make sure it&#39;s real. - //Z.D.// [[/footnote]]. Be considerate of your environment too, so bring a tent. It is best to do this with a companion, one who isn&#39;t trying the ritual. If this goes wrong then you need someone to help you regain some sanity or try and perform some counter-curses. Fail to prepare then prepare to fail.

The true test is of your own self. As stated before, you are pouring your very essence and self into the Library and if you aren&#39;t ready, or confident enough on what you want or need, or you have ulterior motives, then you will face damages which are likely irreversible.

**Other Details:** It should be noted that this inspiration and enlightenment is not entirely what you think it would be. You&#39;re not going to fall asleep and wake up a genius or powerful mage. Inspiration could just be one idea, or the answer to a question you&#39;ve been thinking about for a long time. You could wake up knowing all the best places to eat out in Backdoor. But in all likelihood, what you&#39;ll get will be something specifically oriented to you. Just be aware that even if it looks trivial or unnecessary, it will be useful. And even if it isn&#39;t, knowledge for the sake of knowledge is what the ritual is all about.

**Observations &amp; Stories**

[[div_ class=&#34;fancyborder&#34;]]

In the mountains of Meirionnydd, hidden away from the eyes of men and beasts, lived the lonely giant, Idris. Tall, kindly and curious, Idris was one of the last giants left in Albion, for his kind had been dying out for years, both from hunts and from waning magic. With nowhere left to go, Idris hid himself in the mountains, spending all his remaining time gathering flora and star gazing.

One day, whilst walking the hillsides, Idris found a patch of flowers. Delicate they were, and coloured in the smallest flecks of white, pink and yellow among their green leaves. They were dying, for the waters in the ground they had used to grow had since flowed away to smoother paths. Without sustenance, their heads dropped. //&#34;By the heavens,&#34;// cried the giant in shock, collecting the petalled beauties in his hands, //&#34;what an unfortunates! Do not fret, my little lilies. I shall bring you back. You shall be stronger and prettier than before, I promise.&#34;//

Taking the flowers, the giant walked to the peak of his home and cracked the stones with his fists. With the damp earth exposed, Idris planted the flowers into the hillside and watered them with cool waters from the lakes. //&#34;There, my little ones,&#34;// smiled the giant, //&#34;Now, you shall live once again.&#34;// And thanks to the kindness of Idris, the flowers did live once again, as did their children and descendants.

That night, on the hillsides, Idris slumbered deeply. In the slumber, he dreamt.

//&#34;By the lords,&#34;// exclaimed Idris, //&#34;where am I?&#34;// For in the dream, he had awakened beneath a star filled sky. But these were not the stars he recognised from his mountain home. They were older and great in number, with some not even appearing to be stars at all. Just balls of blackness or clouds of dust. Idris was amazed by the sheer scale of the sky&#39;s contents. And below, at his feet, were blooms of the flowers, lining a pool of shallow, cool water. //&#34;Did you do this&#34;,// asked the giant, kneeling down to speak with the blooms. Then from out of the waters, clothed in silver and painted in his ancestors&#39; sigils,  was a woman Idris knew all too well.

This was Ceridwen, the auburn haired scholar, one of the nine Mabyn and patron of the Library. Idris bowed deeply and greeted her. //&#34;My lady, it is a privilege to meet you. I had hoped you&#39;d survived the culling.&#34;// Ceridwen smiled softly and bowed back. //&#34;I ask,&#34;// said Idris, his face shining with hope, //&#34;is this the Library? The place between places? The realm all scholars seek?&#34;// Idris had long desired to visit the Library for study and sanctuary, but unjust fear and hate had resulted in his exclusion from entry at the hands of men.

Ceridwen said nothing but reached down and took a flower from the pool and placed it within her mouth. Then, to Idris&#39; surprise and slight disgust, a white snake emerged from her lips and coiled down her body.  As the snake moved along the water, it grew larger and larger, before eventually towering above Idris himself. Finally, it stopped and gazed down at the giant with brilliant emerald eyes. //&#34;I have been summoned,&#34;// they exclaimed, //&#34;Which mortal calls me in their soul?&#34;// //&#34;I suppose it was me,&#34;// whimpered Idris, shaking slightly, //&#34;Are you the Nahash, the guardian of the written?&#34;// //&#34;I am,&#34;// replied Nahash, coiling around Idris and raising him up with their tail, //&#34;You must be the lonely giant Ceridwen spoke of. Tell me, what is it you want from me?&#34;//

Idris swallowed and bowed his head slightly. //&#34;Great [[[history-of-behemoths|Behemoth]]], I am hated in my world. I must live in isolation, away from the gates to the realm of the Library. I long to study in these halls but have never had the chance. I wish - I ask you to help me. I ask to be one of your Hands.&#34;// Nahash&#39;s gaze turned towards Ceridwen, who nodded slowly again, to which the Serpent replied with their own nod before returning to Idris. //&#34;Curiosity is a virtue and should not be stultified or hampered. See these flowers below. Should you wish to visit the Tree and the Library, hold a bloom in your hand as you sleep. As you drift, your being shall be allowed to roam this place. But act with care, for I do not grant this boon for simple reasons. Betray my blessing and you shall face punishment. Do we have a deal?&#34;//

Idris agreed and picked up a flower from the water. When he looked up, Nahash and Ceridwen had been replaced with an enormous tree. Idris was amazed. Its branches reach far into the sky, its roots spread far into the hidden depths of the waters, and touched almost everything that could be. And from its wood danced fine lights of blue and gold and black. //&#34;I shall accept this gift with my life.&#34;//

And then, the giant awoke.

And so, from that day onward, Idris was blessed with oneiric union with the Library, and would move through its halls and branches when he dreamt. Through the dreams, he went on to learn and craft, forging new methods in magic and horticulture and paving paths and gardens into the landscape. And when his time came, years after, he parted knowing his blessing would remain and be shared long after he&#39;d been forgotten. For as long as the flowers bloomed and the desire for knowledge remained, all will be welcomed to the Library.

**Doubt**
[[/=]]

Whilst the ritual itself has been attempted by many parties and a good number have emerged successful and free from any real damage, there has been no known record of a successful attempt with multiple dreamers. There were rumours of an attempted joint experience, but they were merely rumours[[footnote]] There has been one attempt. I beg you not to try it. Please. Don&#39;t. - //N.N.// [[/footnote]]. Idris managed so, but the constitution of a giant is very different to that of a regular humanoid. Also, with knowledge comes power. It may be better to only attempt the ritual once to save yourself from addictions, power games or even moral dilemmas.
