------

**Special Containment Procedures:** No Foundation personnel are to enter SCP-6756 without written approval of Site command and extensive orientation to the anomaly. Otherwise all contact with the village is to be conducted through a single Foundation personnel fluent in Japanese permanently residing in SCP-6756.

Provocation and termination of SCP-6756-1 instances is strictly forbidden. 

**Description:** SCP-6756 is a village with a current population of 52 located in the Kyushu region of Japan. SCP-6756&#39;s anomalous property becomes apparent once a human being remains at the location for a period of at least 24 hours, upon which they begin to notice considerable improvement in their mood as well as the feeling of contentment and appreciation towards the qualities and property they currently possess. The population of SCP-6756 is aware of this effect, and the current belief among them is that it has been present for as long as the village itself.

[[include component:image-block |name=shrine.jpg |caption=Depiction of SCP-6756-1 located in the temple shrine in SCP-6756.]]

The forested areas around SCP-6756 are home to an indigenous species[[footnote]] Referred to as SCP-6756-1. [[/footnote]] of mammal bearing resemblance to mustelids and foxes. Instances of SCP-6756-1 are carnivorous pack hunters,[[footnote]] Size of the pack near SCP-6756 estimated to be around 35 instances. [[/footnote]] and are capable of fast and agile movement in pursuit of prey while jumping from one tree to another.  
SCP-6756-1 generally avoid human contact, preferring to keep their distance, although they occasionally display extremely aggressive behavior which is thought to be of territorial reasons. Targets of aggression are subjected to being surrounded by the pack of SCP-6756-1 instances that then use sharp spurs located in the wrist to sever tendons and damage major organs. 

As of yet, no resident of SCP-6756 has expressed concern for the presence of SCP-6756-1 despite having to move in the forested area daily in search of food and other necessities.

**Field Video Log Transcript 1-A**

**Date:** 24/6/2017

**Exploration Team:** MTF Lambda-12 (&#34;Pest Control&#34;)

**Status:** MTF Lambda-12, the first response team has established a mobile base of operations near the edge of the forested area in order to observe instances of SCP-6756-1. 
FOX-1, GECKO-2, WISP-3 and TIGER-4 move in to the forest to investigate after 48 hours of observation failed to produce significant information.
-----
At 1200 hours MTF Lambda-12 proceeded into the forested area, heading straight east in a scouting formation, keeping a distance of 5 meters to each other. Team advanced for 17 minutes without reporting until WISP-3 notified the others of a confirmed visual of what he described as &#34;a weasel in the tree&#34;. The team kept moving as the suspected anomalous entity moved out of sight, although the screeches identified as those of SCP-6756-1 instances, which so far had been a constant reminder of their presence, increased in frequency.

Lambda-12 proceeded straight east for an additional 45 minutes until arriving at a clearing where they spotted papyrus stuck in trees, each depicting a symbol unrecognizable due to the effects of weather on the papyrus. The team took time to check the state of their equipment and further discuss their plan of action. TIGER-4 inspected the symbols closer, upon which an instance of SCP-6756-1 emerged from the foliage and charged at him with great speed. TIGER-4 managed to raise his weapon, but the creature flew past him and disappeared from sight. The team was instructed to not touch the symbols and keep moving immediately, estimating the instance&#39;s aggression stemming from territorial behavior. 

Lambda-12 spotted several instances of SCP-6756-1 stalking them, prompting them to take a more defensive position in which to advance without giving them any possible blind spots from which to attack. The pieces of papyrus bearing a symbol increased in number the further the team went, this time their condition being much better. TIGER-4 was able to recognize a total of 3 symbols which had the meaning of &#34;fox&#34;, &#34;enemy&#34; and &#34;veil&#34; respectively.

FOX-1 notifies the team of a child he spotted approximately 50 meters ahead. The child spots them, and runs away, heading north-east. The team changed course to follow the child, and shortly after arrived to another clearing which turned out to be a small rice field. 2 women of Japanese descent as well as the child were present on the other side of the field.

**Field Video Log Transcript 1-B**

**Date:** 24/6/2017

**Exploration Team:** MTF Lambda-12 (&#34;Pest Control)

**Status:** First response team members FOX-1, GECKO-2 and WISP-3 have vacated the village to return to base. TIGER-4 was temporarily left behind to seek information from the villagers due to his fluency in Japanese. 
-----
Lambda-12 headed straight north-west for 21 minutes. GECKO-2 made note of the absence of the vocalizations produced by SCP-6756-1. The team was instructed to keep the defensive position and their current course, as that is the fastest route to the edge of the forest.

FOX-1 ordered the team to stop, and inspected the inner thigh area of WISP-3, discovering a piece of papyrus bearing a symbol. FOX-1 then gave the order for each member to check all the clothes and gear they have on their person, resulting in 5 additional pieces of papyrus being discovered. 

An instance of SCP-6756-1 jumped from the foliage at GECKO-2 and used a sharp appendage in it&#39;s wrist to strike at his neck, causing him to fall down. GECKO-2 screamed and covered the resulting laceration with his hand. The team responded by moving closer to GECKO-2 and opening fire at the entity which managed to avoid the gunfire for several seconds before a shot landed, killing the entity which bursted into pale blue fire before disappearing entirely. 

The team was alarmed by the abundance of screeches from the nearby trees, and spotted dozens of SCP-6756-1 instances moving rapidly in the trees all around them.  FOX-1 made the call to keep moving in order to avoid being surrounded and overwhelmed by the sheer numbers disadvantage. Several of the entities moved in closer to the fleeing team which responded with gunfire, though it is unclear if any of the shots hit their mark. This lapse in attention allowed several more of the entities to slash and bite GECKO-2 who was already suffering from blood loss. FOX-1 and WISP-3 were both subjected to a simultaneous attack from at least 12 SCP-6756-1 entities.

Audio equipment failed, and contact with the team was lost.

------
**Note:** All members of the team with the exception of TIGER-4 were killed. No bodies were recovered, although all gear and clothing were recovered in a moderate condition. The papyrus symbols in the teams possession were not located.

= **REPORT LOG**
----
The following is the collective log of the research conducted by TIGER-4 following his orders to remain within the village until ordered otherwise.

----
&gt; //It&#39;s 25/6/2017. Day 2 has passed since arriving here. I&#39;m pleased to tell you that the environment here is actually pretty great. The village seemed like a dump at first, but the buildings are actually very similar to those you used to see in the older parts of the countryside. You don&#39;t see this just anywhere, how cool is that?//
&gt; 
&gt; //I think I made a lot of progress getting through to these villagers. The elder, Takeo has somewhat of a leader role here so I believe getting what I can out of him should be my first priority. For now I&#39;ll try to earn their trust, just respecting what they have here has gotten me to a good start, so I&#39;ll keep on helping them with their chores to get closer. The villagers still seem a bit tense around me, must be the assault rifle. Understandable, but with those things screeching next door, I&#39;ll keep it close a bit longer.//

&gt; //Day 3. I think I&#39;ve gotten a bit distracted by this place. There&#39;s a lot of things here that make you, how would I put it, see things in a better light. But I have a job to do.// 
&gt; //Speaking of which, I found that the papyrus symbols we saw earlier are apparently some type of messages. There&#39;s a bunch of them inside the temple, and earlier today I saw some kids run into the forest, each holding one piece. My guess was that they were some kind of communication system with those things, but it&#39;s been hard to get a straight answer from Takeo. I feel like he&#39;s dodging the question, and the rest of these people are definitely not helping.// 
&gt; 
&gt; //I don&#39;t think these people wanted to be found. But that&#39;s just one more reason to contain this place, for them and for us.//

&gt; //It is late evening of Day 5. Takeo asked me if I truly wished to find the answers I was looking for. Naturally I was. I&#39;m going to spend a couple of days solely in the temple. I don&#39;t know why I have to do this, but my guess is that it&#39;s a test of sorts. You know, take some time to think and reflect like what monks do.//  
&gt; 
&gt; //Before I go silent, I have what could be just me but... the people here are very happy considering they are living with so little, surrounded by dangerous animals. It could just be a minimalistic mindset, but they seem just a bit too in unison about it. I wouldn&#39;t think too much about it but I can&#39;t help but to think that me settling here so quickly... nevermind, I&#39;ll continue looking into this.//
&gt; 
&gt; //While I&#39;m still in the paranoid phase, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen Takeo eat anything. I usually see him either at the temple or the shrine. If he has food, he brings it to the shrine. Not one speck of rice for himself.// 

&gt; //This is the dawn of day 14, and the moment I get a hold of my gear again. I spent the last 8 days inside the temple with Takeo. I have to say the experience was enlightening in many levels.//
&gt; 
&gt; //I believe I have convinced Takeo that I, and as extension, the Foundation have nothing but good intentions for their home. I was finally told that apparently the SCP-6756-1 entities are aggressive only towards those who visit the village, and then attempt to leave the area. My question to why they would care about that was again met with a non-direct answer, though this could be a lead. I was told about &#34;Menshuo&#34;, nothing about what it is, just that you should check it out.// 
&gt; 
&gt; //That&#39;s it for the good news though. My suspicions for the symbols were right. For once Takeo was actually direct about it. The symbols are used as a way of communicating with the entities. At the end of my 6th day in the temple Takeo painted a symbol, explaining it&#39;s meaning to be &#34;Emperor&#34;.// 
&gt; 
&gt; [Silence for 5 seconds]
&gt; 
&gt; //He told the villagers snuck symbols like that on the team before they left. Takeo explained they were scared of us, not knowing what our intentions were. I too had one in the back of my shin at some point.//
&gt; 
&gt; //It&#39;s just- I should stay here, and you should stay there.//

------

[[include component:image-block |name=shrine2.jpg |caption=Statue found in a shrine near the town of Menshuo.]]

Menshuo was found to be a deserted town used to house miners from 1952 to 1972, though historical records confirm the area having been inhabited for at least 600 years prior. 

The known records indicate a part of Menshuo&#39;s population having been forcibly drafted to fight in the Second Sino-Japanese War,[[footnote]] A military conflict (1937-1945) between the Empire of Japan and the Republic of China.  [[/footnote]] though this does not explain the apparent disappearance of the entire population.

Nothing that could be linked to SCP-6756 was found in the town limits, however a search into the forest near Menshuo revealed a still tended shrine which housed a statue which depicts a creature assumed to be SCP-6756-1. Menshuo or the nearby forest area show no anomalous properties.

= **INTERVIEW LOG**
----
**DATE:** 10/7/2017

**NOTE:** Takeo Hasami, the apparent elder figure of SCP-6756 was interviewed. The following is a translation of the conversation.
----

= [BEGIN LOG]

**TIGER-4:** Thank you for agreeing to this. I can assure you it&#39;s very important. We want to understand and protect this place.

**Takeo:** I believe you, I really do. I&#39;ve walked the grounds of this village for decades, but I&#39;m not above considering myself all knowing of this place. Our days in the temple were equally enlightening to me as well. I am glad the news you have brought with you from the outside world were good unlike my expectations. None of us have been very fond of what used to be the Emperor. 

**TIGER-4:** That&#39;s great. There&#39;s still something we-

**Takeo:** Did they find out about Menshuo?

**TIGER-4:** Yes, must&#39;ve been a sad sight. It has quite the interesting history, albeit equally sad. We are still unsure why Menshuo is so important.

**Takeo:** Menshuo is my past, always there like the mountain breeze. And I fear it may be my future as well. 

**TIGER-4:** You lived there didn&#39;t you? You left with most of the others when they- the soldiers came for you.

//An elderly woman walks into the room and sets a teapot and two cups on the low table in front of them. The two thank her, and she walks away. Takeo remains silent until the woman has closed the door.//

**Takeo:** I know you&#39;ve been meaning to ask. So ask away.

**TIGER-4:** Oh, um- right. Everyone here, including myself strangely is very... content with the current situation. I can assume many of you came here from similar circumstances as you, but that&#39;s not all there is to it, right? This village, while beautiful and peaceful, isn&#39;t so great as to make me feel this way. 

//Takeo closes his eyes and smiles.//

**Takeo:** I didn&#39;t give you enough credit. You walk with the spirits as well. Fine, it is true that this is no ordinary village, and neither was Menshuo. How about another test of your erudition. Do you have any knowledge of an old legend of &#34;Kakurezato&#34;?

**TIGER-4:** That would be a legend about hidden villages of peace, happiness and harmony. But don&#39;t tell me this is a so called Kakurezato, as the legend also holds those who once visit can never find their way back. Some of my team clearly managed to come back last week.

**Takeo:** Very good, but there is a seed of truth buried in every legend. If you were to leave now, would you bet on your chances of coming back?

//TIGER-4 remains silent.//

**Takeo:** Happiness is like a stream, it has force and meaning behind it which only grows and spreads when linked into others of its kind. They become a river which flows into the opposite direction of another significant part of men, women and children alike. 

//Takeo pauses for a moment. TIGER-4 remains silent.//

**Takeo:** The Emperor knew what he was doing in ordering the population of many a Kakurezato to be divided, quite well in fact. I can&#39;t think of anyone who is at peace, but still wishes to participate in such violence. 

**TIGER-4:** You knew of another Kakurezato, but this time you didn&#39;t wait for the Emperor to find you again.

//Takeo stands up, and waves his hand at TIGER-4, prompting him to follow him out of the temple&#39;s backdoor.//
//The two walk up to a small path leading to the shrine behind the temple, passing two men who are presumably coming from the shrine. TIGER-4 spots a small plate of fried rice set on the shrine, however Takeo walks past the shrine into the forest.//
//They arrive to a clearing, approximately 12 carved stones are set in rows in the middle of the clearing.//

**TIGER-4:** What is this?

//TIGER-4 looks at the stone nearest to Takeo. The writing in the stone is in Japanese, but TIGER-4 is able to translate it.//

**TIGER-4:** Hasami Takeo. Showa 27,[[footnote]] The year 1952 in the Japanese Calendar. [[/footnote]] The era of no Emperor.

//TIGER-4 looks around for Takeo, spotting not only him, but also dozens of SCP-6756-1 instances in the trees around the clearing.//

**Takeo:** When I first arrived here, I was far from content despite what this village is. Expecting this village to eventually meet the same fate at the hands of war as so many other Kakurezato, I doubted if I&#39;d ever know the peace the others here do. 

//Takeo looks back towards the shrine still visible in the distance, prompting TIGER-4 to look as well.//

**Takeo:** But help comes to those who know to ask. Ironic how my help arrived bearing weapons. Some claws, some rifles. 

//Takeo walks into the forest and disappears from sight. A pale blue hue lasting for several seconds can be seen amongst the vegetation. The SCP-6756-1 instances retreat from TIGER-4&#39;s line of sight, leaving him to stand in the clearing in silence.//
