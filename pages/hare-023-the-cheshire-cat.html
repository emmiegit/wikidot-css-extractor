Chappell,

We lost the newest shipment of moonshine from Indianapolis. We were at the docks taking the goods out of the boat, when one of the boys started spluttering and turning purple. I figured he probably swallowed his cig, and was about to check on him when his skull folded inward.

He had barely hit the floor when some fucker dragged himself over the edge of the boat. I pulled my piece and told him to get his ass up and come with me. I don&#39;t know what the fuck he did, but the next thing I knew, I was flat on my ass and he was pointing the Colt at me. We looked at each other for a good long minute, then he dropped the gun and bolted. The whole time, muttering something about getting his fucking hat back.

It was Christoph, the fucking spook you shot. He had that crazy look in his eyes, but I&#39;d recognize that face anywhere. I have no idea how he&#39;s alive, but this shit can&#39;t be good.

A little bird told us he was staying at the Palmer House last April. We set up an ambush in his hotel room, half a dozen of our boys and the boss himself lying in wait for him. By the time he woke up, he was staring down the barrel of a loaded Thompson. Chappell made an example out of him before dumping his body in the river.

We watched him die. We watched Chappell&#39;s pet fish shred the body to pieces. We watched his effects burn. What none of us understand is why we&#39;re still seeing him walking around like nothing happened.

He&#39;s got to have some place he&#39;s operating out of, but so far we haven&#39;t found it. We searched his hotel room, but all we found was a slip of paper with the address of the Sharpers&#39;[[footnote]]  [RAISA DEFINITION - &#34;SHARPERS&#34;] A term used by the Chicago Spirit to refer to Marshall Carter &amp; Dark Ltd.  [[/footnote]] stronghold downtown, tacked onto the wall. Chappell doesn&#39;t think he&#39;s in league with the Sharpers &#39;cause they don&#39;t right like the Spooks, but you never know.

Some of our inside men have been eavesdropping around the other groups to see if they&#39;ve got anything on the Cat.

&gt; Sieskel - The Titans[[footnote]]  [RAISA DEFINITION - &#34;TITANS&#34;] A term used by the Chicago Spirit to refer to paratechnology company Prometheus Labs, Incorporated.  [[/footnote]]
&gt; They got nothing on the Cat. Portlands does seem like a likely hideout for him though.

&gt; Gretzky - The Cheesers[[footnote]]  [RAISA DEFINITION - &#34;CHEESERS&#34;] A term used by the Chicago Spirit to refer to the Foundation. [[/footnote]]
&gt; It&#39;s not like the Cheesers to send Hares and Carolls out into the open like this, so it&#39;s probably not one of their own guys. I did find a file about a colored man in Georgia who fits the bill, but there&#39;s no way in hell that&#39;s the Cat. Just a coincidence.

&gt; The caretakers of the Library keep giving me different answers.
&gt;
&gt; Some have never heard of him, some say they know someone similar, some say the Cat&#39;s a dame. Though the stories of what he can do are consistent, no two caretakers describe the same person. I&#39;ll send a note if I find something good.

We don&#39;t know. It doesn&#39;t seem like he remembers anything from before he crawled out of that boat. He still hates our guts though, but that could be because we tried to kill him as soon as we crawled aboard.

He also seems to have a connection to the Sharpers. We had only recently found out the location of the Sharpers&#39; place, and that was with weeks of surveillance. There&#39;s no way he found it through conventional means.
