**Item #:** SCP-7781

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7781 is to be kept handcuffed to the center of the ceiling in a 10 x 10 x 5 steel cuboid, with cameras on all four (4) upper corners and is to be monitored constantly by security personnel. Feeding is to occur no more than once every fortnight, only providing &lt;two (2) litres of blood each time. The handcuffs are to be swapped once a month due to SCP-7781&#39;s tendency to try and chew through them. In the event of a containment breach, the chamber is to be filled with 20 litres of human blood which should lure SCP-7781 back.

**Description:** SCP-7781 is a humanoid female who appears to be around the age of 18-25 and stands at 1.57 meters tall. Subject wears a deep purple coloured zip-up hoodie over a white crop-top with black leggings and blue sneakers. The only unusual thing about SCP-7781&#39;s appearance is it&#39;s set of teeth, entirely composed of canine-like sharply pointed teeth, which it has ███ of. Subject also displays subtly red tinted eyes. Subject is extremely aggressive to males and docile around females. It appears to instinctively know what the biological gender of the person near it is. SCP-7781 is considered sapient and understands the foundation and it&#39;s motives. Subject also attempts relentlessly to breach containment and threatens to &#34;annihilate anything in my [its] path&#34;. 

It&#39;s main anomalous property is that it can undo the healing process of old wounds from anyone within a 5 meter radius around it, such as old scars and past surgeries. This makes it extremely lethal to people who have had organ transplants and open heart surgery. The time since the injury happened does not seem to matter, subject has been recorded to open up wounds that have healed more than thirty (30) years ago with ease. SCP-7781 also requires a diet of blood to remain it&#39;s calmest, but if too much is consumed then it&#39;s radius of effect widens to fifteen (15) meters, the rate at which wounds are opened is much quicker and it&#39;s overall intelligence, speed and unpredictability increases. 

SCP-7781 also shows remarkable speed and agility normally though and has been documented to scale vertical walls as high as 10 meters and can sprint at speeds of twenty (20) km/h to upwards of ███ km/h when starved or over-fed. SCP-7781 also displays heightened durability and regenerative ability, able remain conscious after being exposed to the full force of a ████████ explosive at point blank range with minor damage to its skin (cuts, bruises etc), healing within a matter of minutes. Healing appears to deplete SCP-7781&#39;s &#34;blood supply&#34; meaning it needs to eventually replace it. Because of this, durability tests are strictly prohibited, unless authorised by 05-█. 

For reasons the foundation doesn&#39;t fully understand yet, SCP-7781&#39;s most innate desire is to taste the blood of every human individual on earth, and is willing to do anything to fulfil this desire. For this reason, and the fact that all attempts at terminating SCP-7781 have been unsuccessful, SCP-7781 is to be locked in it&#39;s containment cell at all times, never to be let out for testing as it can be conducted inside it&#39;s cell and the likelihood of a breach increases dramatically when subject is outside of its present cell. 

Due to SCP-7781&#39;s covetousness, in the event of a breach the casualty numbers are expected to be high, so recontainment will be the site&#39;s main priority.
