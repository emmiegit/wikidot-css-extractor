**Item #:** SCP-7851

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7851 is to be contained in a standard 5m x 5m x5m containment cell, SCP-7851 is to be suspended in midair by use of [REDCTED]. Should SCP-7851 come in contact with anything of unnatural origin [human-constructed material(including humans and other lifeforms], a site lockdown is to be initiated. The containment chamber is to be provided with standby backup generators providing it with enough power to maintain the suspension of the SCP object. No personnel are allowed into the containment chamber, testing is prohibited without written permission from 05 Command. Two (2) to five (5) guards are to be stationed outside of the containment chamber at all times, with shift changes every nine (9) hours. Guards are allowed to use lethal force against all attempts to get into or near the containment chamber.

**Description:** SCP-7851 is a object that in is whatever shape the lifeform that touched it last was thinking about (currently it is in the shape of a briefcase), upon contact with any item of unnatural origin (see above), that object will instantaneously vanish. As of right now it is unknown where the object goes. If the object is capable of thought, the object will transform into an object that the lifeform was last thinking about. The object displays no sentience or ability to be moved outside of external force. SCP-7851 is able to produce a cognitohazardous effect that entices lifeforms to move the object into a packed room and then broadcasts a desire  to touch the object to all surrounding lifeforms.
