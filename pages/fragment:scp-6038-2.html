[[include component:image-block | name=aerial| caption=Satellite photograph of the area affected by SCP-6038| width=50px]]

SCP-6038 refers to an ongoing phenomenon affecting rural villages in the southern region of the Central American country of [REDACTED]. Since every instance has involved the complete termination of local inhabitants, no eyewitness accounts of these events are available.

Three SCP-6038 incidents have been documented thus far. These incidents occurred sequentially in a lapse of 5 days, each taking place between the hours of 2:00 and 3:00 AM. **Addendum A** summarizes the aftermath of an SCP-6038 event.

+++++ **Discovery Log:**

A bus driver arrived at the locality of San Bernardo, [REDACTED]. The individual presented signs of acute psychological disturbance and attempted to contact local authorities, claiming that a massacre had occurred in La Trinidad, a nearby village. Local police dismissed the man as disturbed and argued that incidents in &#34;guerrilla territory&#34; felt outside of their jurisdiction. However, they still elaborated a report on the bus driver&#39;s declaration.

A few days later, the report caught the attention of Agent Guadalupe Ramírez, a local SCP Foundation operative and liaison with local authorities. The peculiarities of the reported events prompted Agent Ramírez to travel to La Trinidad, where he confirmed the bus driver&#39;s testimony. Agent Ramírez&#39;s evaluation of the site suggested anomalous involvement.

----
**NOTE:** The following recording documents of Agent Ramírez&#39;s preliminary evaluation of the first SCP-6038 incident.
----

++++++ [BEGIN LOG]

**00:00:16** //The POV footage shows a destroyed rural village. Houses were ransacked, wooden walls were torn apart, doors were broken down, and chaotic tracks and footprints can be seen in the dirt.//

**Agent Ramírez** My name is Guadalupe Ramírez, SCP Foundation operative. I&#39;m documenting the aftermath of a possible anomalous incident in the town of La Trinidad.

**00:00:19** //Ramirez turns around and walks to the town&#39;s outskirts.//

**Agent Ramírez** Evidence suggests attackers emerged from the ground outside the town and started rounding the population.

**00:00:19** //Ramirez points towards the soil. The camera reveals a mash of footprints.//

**Agent Ramírez** I have identified two sets of footprints, the first one corresponding to the townspeople. The other set is from what I assume to be attackers.

**00:00:21** //The camera zooms into a footprint. It appears double the size of an average human one.//

**Agent Ramírez** The attackers were likely humanoid. Based on the depth of the footprints and the density of the soil, I have estimated a weight of around 200 kilograms and a height of 2 meters.

**00:00:26** //Ramirez points toward a series of holes in the ground.//

**Agent Ramírez** Each set of footprints originates from a different crater in the ground within a 50-meter radius of the town. There are no signs of tunnels or another type of digging, suggesting the entities manifested from those holes in the ground. There is a trail resembling a continuous track alongside those holes, but I could not find any other lead... Still, the location of the holes around the place is consistent with a tactical positioning intended to cut the escape routes for the inhabitants of the town. This was a planned and coordinated attack.

**00:00:30** //Ramirez begins to walk into the destroyed town. Windows and doors are broken. Some walls are blood-stained. The camera lingers on the bloody walls.//

**Agent Ramírez** The attack probably occurred at night without any warning, which means that the villagers were caught in their sleep. They had no time to retreat nor to organize themselves. Victims present signs of violence consistent with the use of both bladed and edged weapons, as well as blunt trauma.

**00:00:30** //The POV slowly turns away from the walls, revealing a mound of butchered corpses. They have been dragged and piled together. A vulture is pecking one of them. The bird flies as Ramirez approaches.//

**Agent Ramírez** Severity of the damage to both human remains and property suggests the physical strength of the perpetrators vastly exceeds that of the average human.

**00:00:36** //The camera moves and focuses on an old shotgun. Ramirez picks it up. It has signs of being fired recently.//

**Agent Ramírez** Victims had access to firearms and used them to defend themselves; it does not seem to have done much for them.

**00:00:42** //Ramirez shows an old cellphone.//

**Agent Ramírez** I managed to recover an intact mobile phone. They tried to send a text message at 1:55 am. The signal is not reliable here so it could not be sent. It reads: &#34;Regreso mañana temprano. Saludos mi Jacintita. Las amo.&#34;[[footnote]]I&#39;m coming back tomorrow morning. Say hello to my little Jacinta. I love you. [[/footnote]]

**00:00:42** //Ramirez shows a flyer. It has a stylized serpent drawn on it. Below, it is written &#34;Abya Yala Libre.[[footnote]]Roughly translates to &#34;Free America&#34;. Abya Yala, is the oldest name used to refer to the American continent. In the Kuna language means &#34;land in its full maturity&#34; or &#34;land of vital blood&#34;. The term is now used by Indigenous movements across the American continent.[[/footnote]]&#34;//

**Agent Ramírez** I found similar flyers around the town. I also found what appears to be a hand-knitted flag with the same design. I&#39;m still not sure if this is of relevance. I will continue my evaluation and report back later... (//Ramirez suddenly goes quiet and the POV focuses on the soil.//) What is that?

**00:00:42** //Ramírez&#39;s hand touches the ground. The camera focuses on their fingers. They are tainted with fine white dust.//

-----
**END NOTE:** After the termination of all inhabitants in the town, there is no evidence of further activity on the part of SCP-6038. It is unclear how SCP-6038 left the incident area. At the time the aftermath of SCP-6038 was discovered, there was no trace of the attackers aside from footprints and very small traces of fine dust from an ivory-like substance.

[[include component:image-block | name=flag | caption=Flag recovered at La Trinidad | width=50px]]

In the following days, Agent Ramírez discovered two other settlements affected by SCP-6038. The three towns were suspected by local authorities to be support bases for the insurgent group known as &#34;Las Víboras&#34;. Nearby towns not affiliated with that group have not been affected. Based on this hypothesis, Agent Ramírez identified the next most probable site for SCP-6038&#39;s manifestation and requested MTF intervention.

**NOTE:** After the discovery of SCP-6038, Agent Ramírez began urgent communication with Dr. Guevara, their immediate superior.
----

++++++ [BEGIN LOG]

**Dr. Guevara:** Look Guadalupe, you need to understand that all you have presented so far is circumstantial evidence. Unfortunately, we still lack sufficient information to confirm the presence of anomalous activity on your site. I&#39;m afraid I can not approve the deployment of an MTF at this level of evidence.

**Agent Ramírez:** The last time I called you it was one town... Now there are two more! All those people are dead because we don&#39;t have &#34;enough information&#34;. What I just can&#39;t figure out is how many more bodies you need to see before we can do something!

**Dr. Guevara:** Careful with your words, kiddo. I&#39;m well aware of your past history of insubordination. You were almost sent to Svalbard once (//Sighs//). I won&#39;t tolerate this behavior. Listen, you do have a great future here... I beg you to think about your career.

**Agent Ramírez:** Do you know what I think? I think that in the States and Europe we send in &#34;Hammer Down&#34; every time someone gives us a dirty look. And here I have almost 100 corpses and can&#39;t get even a single squad!

**Dr. Guevara:** Don&#39;t confuse my sympathy with lameness. I won&#39;t tolerate insubordination... (//Sighs.//) Try to see it from my side. Our site is underfunded and understaffed and yet I am expected to give the same results. We can not afford to waste resources. How do you think it will look if I deploy an MTF at your request and it ends up being nothing?

**Agent Ramírez:** No worse than if you don&#39;t and it ends up being something. Look, Doctor, if you are right and I&#39;m wrong you can laugh at me and relocate my ass to fucking Svalbard for all I care. I will take full responsibility for the fiasco. But if I&#39;m right and you are wrong, I will make sure you take full responsibility for every single one of the dead. Am I being clear enough?

**NOTE:** Body cam footage of MTF Tau-52-5 during the first engagement with SCP-6038.

++++++ [BEGIN LOG]

**00:00:16** //The footage shows the POV of MTF Tau-52-5. The team advances through the rainforest environment. They reach the outskirts of a rural village. Heavy noises and screams can be heard.//

**00:00:41** //The team advances into the houses. Heavily mutilated bodies of several civilians litter the area.//

**00:00:55** //A loud breaking noise is heard and MTF Tau-52-5 turns around. A tall figure has emerged from a nearby house. Its appearance is similar to an ivory statue. It is armed with a shield and a spear of the same ivory-like material, both blood-stained. It appears to be wearing a Greek-style war helmet; however, as opposed to being worn by the entity, the helmet appears to be &#34;sculpted&#34; into its head.//

**MTF Tau-52-5:** I have visual contact with a possible hostile.

**00:01:07** //The entity approaches MTF Tau-52-1, raising its weapons with seeminlgy hostile intend. MTF Tau-52-1 opens fire in return. The entity covers itself with its shield. The bullets dent the ivory-like material of its shield and legs, but the entity shows no signs of pain.//

**00:01:11** //Other members of MTF Tau-52 began to fire upon the hostile. Still, it appears to be ineffective. The entity throws its spears at MTF Tau-52-1, who narrowly manages to avoid the attack. It then draws a sword and keeps approaching the team.//

**00:01:20** //MTF Tau-52-5 looks around. More similar entities had emerged from the night. They slowly approach the team, weapons raised and covering themselves with their shields. One of them throws a spear, piercing MTF Tau-52-3&#39;s legs. They scream in pain and fall to the ground.//

**MTF Tau-52-1:** We need more firepower!

**00:01:31** //Two MTF Tau-52 members (4,6) run to carry their injured companion (3) to safety. One of the enemies has gotten dangerously close to them. Before it can reach them, a loud gunshot is heard, and the entity&#39;s shield is blown away. MTF Tau-52-11 enters the frame wielding a high-caliber anti-tank rifle. A second gunshot and the entity&#39;s upper body explored, its legs fall to the ground and began to dissolve into dust. The spear on the injured operative also disappears.//

**00:01:44:** //MTF Tau-52-11 continues to shoot and neutralize several of the attackers allowing the team to regroup. MTF Tau-52-4 and -6 had managed to bring -3 back. They are about to be examined by the team&#39;s medic when machine gunfire is heard and the three operatives fall to the ground. An entity wielding a shield and what appears to be an ivory machine gun can be seen in the distance. Similarly armed hostiles began to emerge from nearby vegetation.//

**MTF Tau-52-1:** Retreat! Retreat!

**00:01:44:** //MTF Tau-52-5 runs towards their fallen companions in order to help. More machine gun shots are heard and the camera falls to the ground. The footage cuts to black.//
