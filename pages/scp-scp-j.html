**Item #:** SCP-SCP-J

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-SCP-J is to be kept in a hermetically sealed containment vault at Site-58 in the hope that it might suffocate or starve to death, though the Foundation acknowledges that such a wonderful possibility actually coming to fruition is ill-becoming of anything associated with SCP-SCP-J. Under no circumstances is SCP-SCP-J to be let out. In the event that Site-58 becomes compromised through one or more Euclid or Keter containment breaches, SCP-SCP-J is to be given first priority as an unfortunate casualty.

**Description:** SCP-SCP-J, formerly known as &#34;Scippy,&#34; is a cartoon mascot found in training videos for D-class personnel prior to 1994. After retirement on 1/15/1995, SCP-SCP-J worked as a class-B containment specialist at Site-58. 

SCP-SCP-J&#39;s anomalous qualities became apparent when personnel at Site-58 attempted to perform any kind of official work.

**Incident log 5/8/95:**
&gt; **Dr. Henderson:** Everybody out. SCP-████ is breaching containment. I need all mission-critical personnel to follow--
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-SCP-J:** It looks like you&#39;re dealing with a containment breach. Would you like some help?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Henderson:** Not the time, Scippy.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-SCP-J:** The time is currently 5:23 PM. But perhaps you should focus on the matter at hand - containment breaches are very serious problems that must be addressed with your full attention! Have you notified the breach desk?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Henderson:** Get out of the way. I have to get to the containment chamber.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-SCP-J:** The containment chamber? Incorrect. In the event of a containment breach, the breach desk should be notified. This is step one. Step two--
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Henderson:** //I will feed you head-first into a non-anomalous woodchipper if you don&#39;t get out of my fucking way this minute!//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-SCP-J:** That does not sound like it would be a productive use of your time, especially during a containment breach. Would you like me to contact the breach desk for you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-████:** //**I FEAST.**//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Henderson:** [horrified screaming] IT&#39;S EATING MY LEGS -- [death gurgle]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-SCP-J:** I&#39;m sorry, lunchtime was four hours ago.</textarea></pre>
