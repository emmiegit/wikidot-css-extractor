SCP-6969-J is characterized by a number of normalcy-disrupting phenomena not originally intended by SCP-6969-J&#39;s activation, including but not limited to:

* The complete cessation of all sexual desire in all life on Earth.
* The anomalously-enforced physical inability to engage in sexual actions, including for non-reproductive purposes.
* Notable euphoria and abnormal happiness from individuals who identified as asexual prior to SCP-6969-J&#39;s activation.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]It is unclear if this is actually anomalous.[[/span]]
* The manifestation of The Ethereal Skeleton.

The Ethereal Skeleton is a massive, eight-kilometer-tall human skull currently located in Bern, Switzerland. Despite this fact, The Ethereal Skeleton is visible on the horizon from any point on Earth; this has resulted in humanity becoming prominently aware of the anomalous to some extent, and has constituted a moderate [*/broken-masquerade-hub Broken Masquerade Scenario]. Additionally, The Ethereal Skeleton cannot be referred to in any way other than either The Ethereal Skeleton or its pronouns (it/its).

The cause for The Ethereal Skeleton&#39;s manifestation is --currently unknown--. See [[span class=&#34;bt&#34;]]Addendum LXIX[[/span]].

@@    @@SCP-6969-J-ARC was the designation for a thaumaturgic biological process which occurred during ejaculation.

@@    @@When a human being attempted to discharge — whether during the process of intercourse or, more commonly, not — a series of internal thaumaturgic processes would occur within the individual&#39;s genitalia, affecting the entire body. Over the duration of approximately two seconds, the affected subject would enter and experience a causal time loop, repeatedly beginning at the moment of ejaculation and lasting a short period of time. No changes to the subject&#39;s physiology would be preserved between time loops, save for two factors: one, the activity of the nervous system, and two, sperm&#39;s genetic composition (where applicable).[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Of note, the genetic composition of the sperm ejaculated changed states before and after SCP-6969-J-ARC, suggesting the anomaly modified it.[[/span]]

@@    @@Upon conclusion of an unknown number of repetitions, the causal time loop would cease, and a secondary thaumaturgic effect would activate. The secondary effect reset the nervous system to the state it was when the time loop began, allowing for the seamless transition between pre- and post-orgasm states by resetting memory. Following this, anomalous activity relating to SCP-6969-J-ARC would cease.

@@    @@Research suggests that, prior to its neutralization, affected subjects could have experienced a subjective time of anywhere from sixteen days to roughly seventy-three quintillion years every ejaculation.

**ABSTRACT:** Due to the unprecedented and egregious sum of human suffering caused by SCP-6969-J-ARC, it has become imperative for the SCP Foundation to address this anomaly on a large scale. To this end, the Department of Containment, the Ethics Committee, and the Department of Thaumatology are to work in tandem to counteract the negative effects of SCP-6969-J-ARC while preserving normalcy.
----
**METHOD:** Utilizing various orbital satellites capable of Thaumaturgic Spell Injection (TSI) already deployed by the Foundation&#39;s Department of Thaumatology, a Thaumaturgical Interpolator Termination String (TITS) will be universally applied to the entirety of Earth. The TITS in question would be designed to end the SCP-6969-J-ARC loop after the first sequence, completely nullifying any notable effects. A proof of concept can be found in the attached image.

**UPDATE 2022/02/22:** Thaumaturgical pattern identified and prepared for deployment. All systems operational. Preparations are being made for activation within 24 hours.

**FOREWORD:** Following the conclusion of Project ANTIFUCK, thousands of individuals began to notice anomalous phenomena, and dozens of reports were made to various Foundation sites. An emergency meeting was called by The O5 Council involving the Site Directors&#39; Executive Committee of the Whole (SDECotW) and The O4 Council.

**Dr. Crom:** -terrupted as the log begins. Oh shit it&#39;s starting.

//The O5 Council is situated at the head of a very large and round table. Present at the table are various Department Heads, Site Directors, and other important SCP Foundation personnel. The room is very well furnished, as the meeting takes place in O5-6&#39;s personal mansion.//[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Site-01 was under renovation to install a new hot tub.[[/span]] //A view of the horizon is visible through the massive balcony on the eastern wall.//

//O5-6 stands up, and adjusts his pajamas.//

**O5-6:** Thank you all for coming on such short notice. I&#39;m certain everyone here is aware of our current predicament and how catastrophic &#34;Project ANTIFUCK&#34; has been for our organization. Beyond having a stupid-ass name, it has also resulted in an Omega-K Class Scenario, of which we are now dealing with.

//Audible gasps are heard from a number of personnel at the table.//

**Cpt. Kirby:** A-An End of Death Scenario!?

**O5-6:** Errr... no. Lowercase omega.

//Audible groans are head from a number of personnel at the table.//

**O5-6:** Yeah, yeah, cool your jets. An &#34;End of Sex&#34; Scenario is not something to scoff at.

**Dir. House:** Why the hell do we even have a designation for that? Who comes up with this shit?

**O5-2:** (//Interjecting//) {{I AM CURRENTLY RUNNING 14,234 SIMULATIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY PER SECOND, EACH DEPICTING A WAY THE WORLD CAN END. BE THANKFUL WE ARE NOT EXPERIENCING A DELTA-PHI-LAMBDA &#34;SQUIRRELS BECOME SENTIENT AND RIP YOUR FACE OFF&#34; SCENARIO.}}[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Yes, this [*/scp-3761 actually happened].[[/span]]

**Dir. House:** I—

**Agt. Urquhart:** Hey! That&#39;s my sorority!

//Murmuring begins to fill the room. O5-1 slams his comically large gavel.//

**O5-1:** Okay, everyone shut up. Six?

**O5-6:** Thank you One. It appears that not only has sex become biologically impossible for humans, but similarly for animals as well. We will begin to see extinctions within a few hours, and as the days progress, a mass-extinction event will begin to unfold as ecological systems become crippled and collapse. At the present moment, mitigating the negative effects of Project ANTIFUCK is the SCP Foundation&#39;s number one priority. Does anyone have any ideas?

**Dr. Blake:** (//Stroking his beardless chin//) Hmm... It //is// possible to inverse [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6659 SCP-6659] to insert a concept into the Noosphere and thus restoring sex, though we would need an extremely powerful sex-related physical object to derive the concept from.

**Dir. Aktus:** What about Clef? I heard he has [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/gears-is-totally-not-a-robot-guys three flam]—

//A loud groan is heard from the right-side of the table. An emaciated and shriveled man raises his hand weakly. He has three eyes.//

**Dr. Clef:** (//Repeated, indecipherable wheezing, followed by a series of desperate coughs.//)

**O5-2:** Yeesh. This really did a number on him.

**Dr. Blake:** It&#39;s only been a few hours, for fuck&#39;s sake.

**O5-6:** ...Okay, that plan&#39;s out of the question. Does anyone have any other i— What the //fuck// is that!?

//O5-6 points out the east-facing window. The Ethereal Skeleton rests on the horizon, unmoving.//

//Silence elapses for thirteen seconds, before Dr. Naomi Ross stands up.//

**Dr. Ross:** That appears to be an essophysical manifestation, sir.

**O5-1:** A what?

//Dr. Ross pulls out a tape recorder, and hits &#39;Play&#39;.//

&gt; //I direct the Essophysics Department, which you all well know is concerned with embodiments — manifestations of concepts within reality. An embodiment of the concept &#34;[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6996 red]&#34; would carry all of the characteristics conceptually associated with that color, such as being angry, or desirable, or malevolent. This is a simplified method of conceptualizing what&#39;s actually going on here; a tangible object or entity embodies a memetic structure within the Noosphere by conforming to its idealistic ideatic shape.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Simply put, an embodiment is a physical item that&#39;s shaped like an idea. And, given the progression of human intelligence and development, over time, that shape can change. This means that, if the essophysical nature of an entity is not readily apparent, it can be discerned by comparing that entity&#39;s change over time to changes in human conception and ideatic space; a correlation almost certainly indicates causation.//

//Dr. Ross stops the recording. The entire table nods in understanding thanks to the extremely clear explanation.//

**O5-6:** Ah, that makes perfect sense. You&#39;re saying The Ethereal Skeleton is a manifestation of some concept, then?

**Dr. Ross:** That would be correct, Six.

**O5-6:** Please, Six was my father. Call me Shirley.

**Dr. Ross:** Uh, okay. That would be correct, Shirley. When Project ANTIFUCK concluded, it appears to have disturbed the Noosphere to the point that some concept manifested itself on Earth, and in an extreme fashion too. Considering what we know about essophysics and The Ethereal Skeleton, it leaves us with only one candidate for the corresponding concept.

**O5-1:** (//Interjecting//) Which is...?

**Dr. Ross:** I believe that concept would be sex itself, One.

//There is furious murmuring around the table. O5-1 slams the comically large gavel again.//

**O5-1:** What.

**ABSTRACT:** Much to the vexation of both this proposal&#39;s authors, the SCP Foundation&#39;s top priority at the moment is ending the ongoing [[span class=&#34;bt&#34;]]ωK-Class[[/span]] &#34;End of Sex&#34; Scenario. This is characterized by the complete inability for any multicellular living being[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]**//##MediumPurple|And apparently machines too. Don&#39;t ask me how the guys at AIAD figured that one out.##//**[[/span]] to engage in sexual acts, whether reproductive or not. This has resulted in a slow but inevitable mass-extinction event as species begin to die off due to lack of new members.

SCP-6969-J was triggered during [[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]PROJECT ANTIFUCK[[/span]], a joint project between the Department of Containment and Department of Thaumatology to neutralize SCP-6969-J-ARC. The process utilized a Thaumaturgical Interpolator Termination String to inject an arbitrary sequence of thaumaturgic runes into the ongoing SCP-6969-J-ARC sequences, particularly to terminate their function. Via the use of orbital satellite array, the Thaumaturgical Interpolator Termination String[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon better-contrast&#34;]]**//##HotPink|No, I&#39;m not using the acronym.##//**[[/span]] was applied permanently to the Earth, accidentally culminating in SCP-6969-J.

Additionally, The Ethereal Skeleton (an ethereal skeleton representing the essophysical manifestation of sex itself) appeared in Switzerland. The significance of this event is unknown.

The purpose of [[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]PROJECT OVERFUCK[[/span]] is to:

# Reverse the effects of SCP-6969-J and allow for reproduction to occur, even at the cost of reactivating SCP-6969-J-ARC.
# Determine the root cause of SCP-6969-J&#39;s over-effectiveness in Thaumaturgical Interpolation and prevent the scenario from happening again.
# Neutralize The Ethereal Skeleton.

----

**METHOD:** In order to minimize the impact of activities in Project OVERFUCK on the Project Leads, both Project Leads were selected due to their asexuality, extensive skill set, and loyalty to the Foundation.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]**//##MediumPurple|Despite what most people think, I&#39;m not asexual because I&#39;m a dinosaur.

The Department of Essophysics has been granted [[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]ADMINISTRATOR-6[[/span]] clearance to employ all of the Foundation&#39;s resources to neutralize SCP-6969-J. To this end, the Department of Essophysics will work in tandem with the Decommissioning Department (henceforth &#34;Double-D&#34;)[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon better-contrast&#34;]]**//##HotPink|:|##//**[[/span]] [[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]**//##MediumPurple|:)##//**[[/span]] to employ both parascientific and anomalous means in achieving this goal.

Below are initial attempts at neutralizing SCP-6969-J, undertaken by Project OVERFUCK.
[[/div]]

----

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**INVOLVED DEPARTMENT(S):** Department of Thaumatology

**INTENTION:** Utilize a secondary Thaumaturgical Interpolator Termination String to terminate the prior termination string. Apply it locally first to test changes before worldwide implementation.

**INTERACTION:** No effect. This is likely due to a termination string not being able to terminate another termination string, but rather solely terminate the current spell as a whole.

**RESULT:** N/A

----

**INVOLVED DEPARTMENT(S):** Department of Thaumatology, Memetics Division

**INTENTION:** Create a memetic agent capable of bypassing all neurological defensive barriers (Type XII Langford Agent) which compels individuals to subconsciously perform a thaumaturgic ritual to initiate reproduction. This memetic agent would also compel individuals to spread it to people not already infected, and thus ensure its existence inter-generationally.

**INTERACTION:** The agent successfully exists and is capable of transmitting, however the thaumaturgical spell fails to trigger mid-way through, suggesting that although the spell is not nearly identical to SCP-6969-J-ARC, it is still targeted by the Thaumaturgical Interpolator Termination String.

**RESULT:** Failure to undo the damage caused by SCP-6969-J; additionally the memetic agent has already spread to nearly 4% of the global population within a day, resulting in many individuals performing a half-complete ritual at inopportune or inappropriate times. This has further increased the severity of the concurrent Broken Masquerade Scenario.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon better-contrast&#34;]]**//##HotPink|These people make me want to go into competitive alcohol drinking.##//**[[/span]]

**INVOLVED DEPARTMENT(S):** Department of Pataphysics

**INTENTION:** Make this a -J.

**INTERACTION:** Action is successful; article is officially designated as a &#34;joke&#34; and presumably unlikely to impact the larger narrativistic canon.

**RESULT:** Failure; canons are still interconnected, with the only discernible difference being humorous quirks throughout official documentation.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon better-contrast table1&#34;]][[span class=&#34;st&#34;]]FUNNY RANDOM BOLD TEXT[[/span]][[/span]]

**FOREWORD:** As SCP-6969-J has resisted attempts at its reversal through the use of parascientific means, the following logs detail attempts by Project OVERFUCK to terminate it through the use of other anomalies.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**RELEVANT SCP(S):** [[[SCP-5659]]][[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]SCP-5659 is a large, trapped entity that is believed to be the god of lust. SCP-5659 feeds off of negative emotion, and if allowed to grow will eventually break free and attempt to destroy humanity.[[/span]]

**INVOLVED DEPARTMENT(S):** O4 Council, Department of Thaumatology

**INTENTION:** Release SCP-5659 from its constraints and allow it to breach inner containment. Maintain wider thaumaturgic runes to prevent its further breach.

**INTERACTION:** The residents of Częstochowa, Poland were quickly evacuated and provided compensation for their time in the form of Class-C amnestics. SCP-5659 was fed extreme negative emotion via D-Class and subsequently grew thousandsfold. Shortly thereafter, it manifested in our physical reality. However, upon entering our world, SCP-5659 stopped and calmly approached a nearby Foundation operative, stating it suddenly felt extreme clarity and no longer wished to destroy humanity, but rather join it. After a few days of conversation, SCP-5659 was hired by Site-120 staff, under supervision of Site Director D. Asheworth.

**RESULT:** No effect on SCP-6969-J.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]**//##MediumPurple|I mean, a new Foundation employee is always a plus, right?##//**[[/span]]

Sexual stimulation taking place within the conceptual space are experienced in the body of the subject. The owners of SCP-2541 (PoI-7058-A and PoI-7058-B) are cooperative with Foundation efforts and presumably benevolent in intention.[[/span]]

**INVOLVED DEPARTMENT(S):** Memetics Division, Department of GoI Research

**INTENTION:** Seek assistance from PoI-7058-A and PoI-7058-B in repurposing or using the mechanisms behind SCP-2541 in restoring the ability for humans (and later animals) to orgasm.

**INTERACTION:** PoI-7058-A and PoI-7058-B were successfully reached via telephone. The ongoing scenario was explained to the duo, and they were requested for assistance. PoI-7058-B expressed acknowledgement and commented that SCP-2541 had indeed ceased functioning a week prior and the business was to be shut down; subsequent testing with SCP-2541 failed to conceptually transport the subject to the corresponding thought-space.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon better-contrast&#34;]]**//##HotPink|Did no one think to test it before asking?!##//**[[/span]]

&gt; Project ANTIFUCK&#39;s effects were entirely nullified on March 5th, 2022, at 4:20 PM UTC, and all life on Earth that were capable of engaging in sex before will be capable of doing so after this time.

**RELEVANT SCP(S):** [[[SCP-3457]]][[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]SCP-3457 refers to a ritual known as the Rites of Solomon. When performed, it allows an individual to achieve demiurge status and fundamentally alter how thaumaturgy operates on a global scale. The physical components of SCP-3457 are held by The Global Occult Coalition, while the information on how to do the ritual is kept by the SCP Foundation.[[/span]]

**INTENTION:** Contact the GOC in accordance with the Köln Agreement to utilize the Rites of Solomon on a suitable Project OVERFUCK operative. Once demiurge status is achieved, perform the necessary actions to ensure SCP-6969-J is incapable of affecting the Earth and SCP-6969-J-ARC does not function.

**INTERACTION:** The GOC approved of the use of SCP-3457 and subsequently met with Project OVERFUCK operatives to perform the rite. After a few hours, the ritual was successfully completed, and Agent Ueda successfully achieved demiurge status. Agent Ueda was instructed on how to restructure thaumtology with minimal impact to other rituals that are necessary for containment. Following this, Agent Ueda was successfully de-demiurgified.

**Dr. Crom:** —nside //another// addendum? You&#39;re kidding me!

//Dr. Ross takes a chug from a fat dart and stands up to address the room.//

**Dr. Ross:** Okay, as you all know, we recently invoked the Köln Agreement with the Global Occult Coalition to activate the Rites of Solomon. What this //should// have done was rewrite the rules of thaumaturgy to end SCP-6969-J and its -ARC&#39;s effects. The actual result? Jack shit. As it turns out, we&#39;ve been approaching this issue wrong the entire damn time, and we&#39;re gonna need to come up with new attack vector. Any ideas?

//Dr. Ribeiro raises their hand.//

**Dr. Ribeiro:** If we already knew that, why did you just explain it to us?

//Dr. Ross takes a long drag from their bunt.// [!-- This is intentional. --]

**Dr. Whitney:** Guys, we&#39;re wasting time. Hundreds of species are already dead and food shortages are happening all over the world. If we don&#39;t solve this quickly then we&#39;re definitely screwed. So, again, does anyone have //any// ideas?

//Dr. Sherman raises his hand.//

**Dr. Sherman:** Have we tried giving up?  

//The room murmurs in agreement. Dr. Ross lights their weed cigarette as Dr. Whitney sighs.//

**Dr. Ross:** It&#39;s on the itinerary.

//Dir. Bold raises his hand.//

Dir. Bold: We shoot shit. [!-- This is intentional. --]

**Dr. Ross:** For the fifth time, Bold, &#39;shooting shit&#39; isn&#39;t the solution to everything.

//Dir. Bold sulks and sighs unhappily.//

**Dr. Whitney:** Okay, ideas clearly aren&#39;t overflowing here. Let&#39;s take a step back. How can we approach this from another angle, one that isn&#39;t thaumaturgical?

//Dir. al-Taqi raises their hand.//

**Dr. Ross:** No, &#39;shooting shit but with religion&#39; isn&#39;t an acceptable answer either.

//Dir. al-Taqi lowers their hand. Dr. Ross sighs, and pulls out another blunt to smoke.//

**O5-6:** If I may?

**Dr. Ross:** You may, Shirley.

**O5-6:** Thank you. And don&#39;t call me Shirley.

**Dr. Ross:** Wh- Huh- I—

**O5-6:** (//Interrupting//) It may be possible, based on the data we&#39;ve gathered, to utilize [[[SCP-2000]]][[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]You already know about this one.[[/span]] to reconstruct all life on Earth to only reproduce through asexual means. Based on what we can tell, asexual reproduction is not prevented in multicellular organisms; therefore, it would be theoretically possible to redesign life to only reproduce through this method. We could use [[[scp-4224|The Ennui Protocol]]] to also completely rewrite consensus reality so that life has always and only reproduced asexually. Sex itself will be an anomaly.

There is clearly no other choice. We have tried everything in our power to bring back sex, and yet, sex has not come back. It is clear that nothing our organization can do can bring back a fundamental part of the human experience. So, instead of trying fruitlessly to bring back the thing we lack, we instead alter the fundamental human experience. We erase the part of our history that we cannot emulate, and we&#39;ll overwrite it with a new history, one that cannot be taken from us again.

I know this may be shocking, but it is the only way we can preserve humanity. Do I have your collective approval?

//There is stunned silence from the entire room.//

**O5-6:** I&#39;ll take that as a yes.

**O5-6:** Fools! All of you! You&#39;ll see, you&#39;ll ALL see! You&#39;ll rue the day you thought you could CRITICIZE SHIRLEY!

//The door slams shut behind O5-6 and the various people chasing him.//

**Dr. Whitney:** ...Damn. You&#39;d think someone who ran the SCP Foundation would be a bit more composed.

//Dr. Ross picks up another blunt and lights it.//

**Dr. Ross:** You know what they say about being larger than they are and also falling; the phenomena are correlated.

**Dr. Whitney:** I don&#39;t thin— hey, how many of those things do you even have?

**Dr. Ross:** What, these? (//Dr. Ross pulls out a few more blunts//) We milk them from the essophysical embodiment of weed we keep in the basement.

Dir. Bold: Shoot shit?

**Dr. Whitney:** Yes! Naomi, why don&#39;t we just shoot The Ethereal Skeleton?

[[div class=&#34;n-text&#34;]]
Though an educated guess would be that
sex&#39;s essophysical manifestation was a
skeleton because sex itself was killed, thus
merging it with the concept of death, and
when we reactivated the concept of sex,
we also inadvertently killed everything by
turning it into grape soda, the known
