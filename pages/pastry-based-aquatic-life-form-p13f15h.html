[[include component:image-block name=piefish2.JPG|caption=Dr Nanoro&#39;s artistic depiction of this monstrosity]]

**Name:** Chris

**Species:** Piefish

**Does it taste good in gravy?:** Unlikely

**Description:** P13F15H is a pastry based aquatic life form that just kind of turned up at Site-19 one day...like just sat on the doorstep. 
Our original plan was to eat it, however it immediately began throwing up Anomalies (listed below) of a possible pastry based nature except the Alphabetti Spaghetti incidents which are definitely pasta based.
We keep P13F15H in the IT room cause no one cares about IT. There it flaps its little pastry fins at the keyboard, annoying everyone on Site 19&#39;s emergency chat. It did this so well that we promoted it to moderator:

&gt; &lt;Piefish&gt; abluhlbuhlbuhblhlbuhlbuhlbuhlb
&gt; &lt;TwistedGears&gt; well said, Piefish
&gt; &lt;TwistedGears&gt; I can see why they put you in charge

It also has a habit of exploding (and by by exploding we mean explod)

&gt; * Piefish explod

We then liked hearing this nonsense so much that we promoted Piefish to our undercover Facebook operation:

&gt; HELLO FACEBOOK. THIS IS AN UNDERCOVER OPERATION STATUS. DO NOT BE ALARMED...ABLUHBLUHLBUHLBUHLBUH.

[[include component:image-block name=scp_id_v2_by_chrisakapiefish-d834nms.jpg|caption=IT Technician Chris Sanders has been volunteered for looking after it.]]

**Anomaly vomit:**

The first anomaly P13F15H created caused the whole site to be plunged into an alternate dimension for a day where the Foundation became cuddly and pink. It was horrible.

* [[[SCP-682-CU | SCP-682-CU]]]

The second anomaly it threw up was expelled so hard that it flew all the way to England and landed in the city of Norwich. It caused a lot of structural damage to Site-19 and is a very bad Piefish for doing it.

* [[[SCP-2699 | SCP-2699]]]

After a long period of P13F15H doing nothing in particular, it suddenly began vomiting at an extremely high rate, nearly tearing apart the fabric of reality itself.

It then caused this shit to happen:

* [[[SCP-3198| SCP-3198]]]

**Alphabetti Spaghetti incidents:** 

The first incident happened after we let it play //Fallout: New Vegas//, upon which it immediately vomited Alphabetti Spaghetti and created this:

* [[[the-foundation-never-changes | The Foundation never changes]]]

**Incidents where P13F15H got access to MS Paint and then replaced critical files with its shitty drawings:** 

[[collapsible show=&#34;The 087 incident&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]

**Researcher Notes:** I guess this gets the general idea but the face does not look like that.

[[collapsible show=&#34;The 093 Blue Test incident&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]

**Researcher Notes:** Pretty sure D-Classes don&#39;t smile when coming across the humanoids.

[[=image 093.png]]

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;The 096 incident&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]

**Researcher Notes:** I get we don&#39;t have any photos of its face but I think we can be fairly confident it&#39;s not a &#34;lenny face&#34; P13F15H.

[[=image 096.png]]

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;The 106 incident&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]

**Researcher Notes:** Again, pretty sure 106&#39;s victims aren&#39;t smiling, especially when their leg is broken.

[[collapsible show=&#34;The 173 incident&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]

**Researcher Notes:** I have no idea with this one.

[[=image 173.png]]

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;The 354 incident&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]

**Researcher Notes:** I mean, did you read a completely different document for this one P13F15H?

[[=image 354.png]]

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;The 610 incident&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]

**Researcher Notes:** Is that a character from //Undertale//?

[[collapsible show=&#34;The 682 incident&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]

**Researcher Notes:** 682 doesn&#39;t have wheels P13F15H... good song choice though.

[[collapsible show=&#34;The 939 incident&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]

**Researcher Notes:** You know what, this one is actually pretty accurate.

[[collapsible show=&#34;The 999 incident&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]

**Researcher Notes:** Please don&#39;t write -J&#39;s P13F15H.

[[collapsible show=&#34;The 3770 incident&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]

**Researcher Notes:** Didn&#39;t Researcher Fingo get sent this on Christmas?

[[collapsible show=&#34;The Church of the Broken God incident&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]

**Researcher Notes:** Sigh.
