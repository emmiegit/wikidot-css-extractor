Gronk and Grak stood around their would-be spacecraft, analyzing the crudely constructed craft in despair. 

[[size 125%]][[span style=&#34;font-family: &#39;Indie Flower&#39;&#34;]]**&#34;I MUST CONFESS, I AM MOST INFURIATED AT OUR CIRCUMSTANCES.&#34;**[[/span]][[/size]] Gronk spoke softly, his voice sending mild tremors through the ground around the two. He was the lead engineer of the Wharagarbl space program, which had, unfortunately, run into a snag.

[[size 125%]][[span style=&#34;font-family: &#39;Indie Flower&#39;&#34;]]**&#34;PERHAPS WE ARE NOT OBSERVING THIS PROBLEM IN THE MOST EFFICIENT OF FASHIONS.&#34;**[[/span]][[/size]] Grak replied, her various green chins jiggling under the thunder of her meek (that is to say, meek for a Whargarbalian.) voice. [[size 125%]][[span style=&#34;font-family: &#39;Indie Flower&#39;&#34;]]&#34;HAVE YOU CONSIDERED PAINTING IT THE COLOR RED?.&#34;[[/span]][[/size]] 

[[size 125%]][[span style=&#34;font-family: &#39;Indie Flower&#39;&#34;]]**&#34;OF COURSE I HAVE CONSIDERED PAINTING IT RED, GRAK. FOR GROBDONOLAR&#39;S SAKE, I&#39;M NOT A GRUBLING. I KNOW WHAT I&#39;M DOING. I JUST DON&#39;T THINK SPEED IS WHAT WE NEED HERE. THIS IS WHY I HAVE ELECTED TO PAINT IT PURPLE, THE COLOR OF SPACE. MY WORKING THEORY WAS IF WE PAINTED IT PURPLE, WE WOULD ACHIEVE SPACE TRAVEL AS THE COLOR MATCHES THAT OF ITS INTENDED EXPLORATORY AREA.&#34;**[[/span]][[/size]] Gronk&#39;s volume elevated as he spoke, the ground beginning to shake violently until the small spacecraft fell on its side.

[[size 125%]][[span style=&#34;font-family: &#39;Indie Flower&#39;&#34;]]**&#34;I COMPREHEND YOUR FRUSTRATION BUT YOU DON&#39;T NEED TO YELL, GRONK.&#34;**[[/span]][[/size]]

[[size 125%]][[span style=&#34;font-family: &#39;Indie Flower&#39;&#34;]]**&#34;I APOLOGIZE. IT WAS NOT MY INTENTION TO HURT YOU. I AM MERELY FRUSTRATED AT THIS SITUATION, AS YOU STATED. I WISH THERE WERE A WAY TO JUST MAKE THIS FLY.&#34;**[[/span]][[/size]] He stroked his chins, thumbing each of the flabby protrusions with a filthy, greasy finger. 

[[size 125%]][[span style=&#34;font-family: &#39;Indie Flower&#39;&#34;]]**&#34;WAIT. MAKE IT FLY. WHY NOT SIMPLY TURN OFF THE GRAVITY? OH, THAT IS RIDICULOUS. IT WOULD SIMPLY NOT WORK.&#34;**[[/span]][[/size]]  Grak shook her head, her jowls producing a sloppy wet sound as they moved.

[[size 125%]][[span style=&#34;font-family: &#39;Indie Flower&#39;&#34;]]**&#34;BY GROBDONOLAR&#39;S GREATAXE! GRAK, YOU ARE A GENIUS. WE MUST SIMPLY TURN OFF THE GRAVITY! THEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE SPACE FLIGHT! &#34;**[[/span]][[/size]] In a heated moment of elation, Gronk grabbed Grak and kissed her (That is to say, he headbutted her with all his might, as this is a proper Whargarbalian kiss.) before running off towards the planet gravity switch.

The next day, Whargarble became a space-faring society. All of Whargarble, whether they were ready for it or not.</textarea></pre>
