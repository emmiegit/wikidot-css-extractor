I do not know where to go at this point. The school building is vacant, but you and I are here anyway. We both could leave, but we&#39;ve made up excuses as to why we couldn&#39;t. You are incredible. Surprisingly, you seem to think the same thing about me. Your birthday is coming up. I&#39;ll have to get you flowers, or perhaps that necklace you said looked good. I can&#39;t help but hear the sounds coming from the vents over the sound of your voice. I make a joke about it...

The music hallway is cluttered and smells like weed. It&#39;s odd, really, how the school is built. You&#39;ve always said its reminiscent of a prison, but today it is our sanctuary. We walk out into the band room. Practice has long since ended. I can&#39;t even think of something to say to you, but I&#39;ve never been great at that. You laugh a little bit about something someone wrote on the whiteboard, and play on your snare. I can&#39;t see anything past your eyes...

There&#39;s a lot I want to say, but I don&#39;t think I will today. We continue our walk and talk about nothing at all. Like a dream, eventually it ends. Then, we say our goodbyes because you have to go eat with your dad before he leaves town. And that&#39;s it. We both get into our cars, sigh, and drive off. Nothing happened, but I feel happy. No climatic end, yet I feel content...
