**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6460 has been acquired and closed off to the public. Targeted application of amnesticization and disinformation campaigns have been and continue to be propagated as needed to all relevant groups and individuals such as local law enforcement, media, and the loved ones of missing persons whose disappearances have resulted from entrance into SCP-6460. Any other incidental remaining witnesses are to likewise be debriefed and amnesticized, should any be identified.

Any potential survivors exposed to SCP-6460 are to be taken into Foundation custody for in-depth investigation, debriefing, or similar amnesticization and disinformation protocols preceding a subsequent release back into the public. More permanent containment may be necessitated should persistent anomalous effects on said persons present themselves.

D-Class exploration and testing will continue to be carried out under the supervision of SCP-6460 staff, in order to more concretely determine the exact nature and scope of SCP-6460’s anomalous properties, as well as to search for any evidence as to what happened to civilians and prior D-Class subjects, to whatever extent proves feasible.

**Description:** SCP-6460 refers to a corn maze located in central Kansas that occasionally leads visitors who enter it into an apparently extra-dimensional space, from which no possibility of exit or return has so far been identified. Within this space, some technological devices will cease to properly function, such as video recording and location tracking, though others such as phone service and other forms of audio communication remain operable as long as the devices used remain powered and physically undamaged.

While a regularly traversed SCP-6460 will function as a normal, non-anomalous maze for a significant majority of individuals traversing it, the probability of any particular visitor triggering an instance’s anomalous properties increases as the volume of recent visitors decreases. This inverse relationship has been observed to culminate in the first individual to enter the maze being virtually guaranteed to trigger SCP-6460’s effects by the time a given SCP-6460 instance has gone unvisited for more than approximately three weeks.

Affected visitors to SCP-6460 frequently report various odd and unsettling sights, sounds, and phenomena that increase in frequency the longer they remain with SCP-6460. Though some such aspects have been consistently reported across multiple subjects, other details have proven unique to a given individual. 

Despite the classically seasonal availability and date ranges of non-anomalous corn mazes, SCP-6460 and its constituent flora have so far remained in a largely consistent physical state, regardless of age or time of year. The plants have also so far proven functionally impervious to destruction, as any damaged or removed stalks are quickly replaced as soon as the affected area is no longer being directly observed.

SCP-6460 was originally discovered following the automatic flagging of a series of posts on the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/parawatch-hub | Parawatch]]] online forums from a local civilian who expressed concern that the recent disappearance of a loved one may be tied to supernatural causes. Relevant portions of the thread are archived below:

##white|Hey everyone, so I’m usually more of a lurker than a poster, but I think I may have had my first real brush with the paranormal… actually less ‘brush’ and more like ‘hit by a f’king train’, or at least watching someone else get hit by one. Ok I’m losing the metaphor, but whatever, Here’s what happened:##

##white|So I was on the phone with my BF Jackson after he went with his friend to some dopey corn maze waaay out in the stix; like the middle of nowhere even for Kansas, but the place is known for setting up one of these each year around Halloween. Anyway, it’s not really much his kinda thing, but his friend loves this kinda shit, so he agreed to tag along nice guy that he is. Anyway, after agreeing to a “race” that obviously separated the two, Jackson got pretty lost. He also soon got pretty bored, so he called me and we just chatted normally for like 30 minutes as he wandered around trying to find his way out. Eventually though, he started to seem kinda spooked... I mean, at first it was like normal level spooked, mind you, nothing that I figured was worth worrying about, especially since he’s always been a big baby about this sorta thing, buuut… Well, soon he started to sound like, actually terrified. He started describing all this creepy shit and talking about how he was hearing weird otherworldly noises, yet had stopped hearing the voices of any other people, or even the sounds of animals; that the maze was way bigger than it should have been, and it was getting dark too fast; eerie stuff like that.##

##white|At this point, I was starting to worry, so I told him to call for help. This turned out to be a tragic miscommunication. I&#39;d meant for him to ‘call’ as in literally shout out for any other nearby maze-roamers, but he took my suggestion to mean call someone on his phone. Probably the police or his friend, IDK; all I do know is that he excitedly said “great idea babe, I’ll call you right back to update ya,” and well, that’s the last I heard from him.##

##white|It’s been almost 24 hours since anyone has heard from him by now, and I just heard that his parents officially filed a Missing Person’s Report. IDK, I’m going out on a limb posting about this here, I wanna think that there&#39;s probably some simpler explanation I just haven’t thought of. That he’ll turn up any minute, apologizing and explaining what happened and embracing me, telling me not to worry and that everything’s okay, but… It hasn’t happened yet, and it&#39;s getting harder and harder not to worry about whether it ever will. I’m so freaked out at his point, none of this feels real, and I can’t shake the feeling that something is fundamentally WRONG here! I know &#39;spooky phone call from missing teenager&#39; could be a stretch but it&#39;s a base that I&#39;m not sure anyone else is gonna cover, sooo... Like, has anyone here ever experienced or heard of anything similar to this before?##

##white|I&#39;m going crazy with not knowing so if anybody has anything, plz plz plz lemme know!##

##white|OP not gonna lie, I wouldn’t say to not worry at all, but personally this just sounds like someone in a creepy setting getting lost and letting it get to their head. Like, even if something DID happen, I doubt it was paranormal.##

**Date:** November 09, 2021.

**Individuals Present:** D-Class Personnel D-13509, Junior researcher Coby Gaskins, Senior Researcher Alexis Bolton.

**Foreword:** The following log compiles relevant audio and video records from both D-13509 and the staff researchers externally overseeing the operation.
-----
&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;

**Res. Gaskins:** Ok, video and audio look good. D-13509, are you ready?

**D-13509:** Ready enough, I guess.

**Res. Bolton:** Alright, well then please proceed into the maze.

[D-13509 walks into the entrance of SCP-64601, saying little for the first four minutes as he meanders through the maze.]

**D-13509:** Oh hey, is there any particular strategy I should be using in navigating my way through this thing?

**Res. Gaskins:** Not really, that is up to your discretion.

**D-13509:** Ok then. Just how big is this maze anyway?

[There is a brief pause before an answer comes.]

**Res. Bolton:** I don&#39;t have the, uh, exact measurements with me at the moment, but it is not really important anyway. Please just continue through the maze, and if you can remember to please turn and face each potential pathway for the camera, not just whatever direction you decide to take. 

**D-13509:** Yeah, yeah, whatever. //(murmuring) Seems pretty damn important to me…//

[D-13509 continues onward for another minute and a half when the camera feed begins to flicker before suddenly going out.]

**Res. Gaskins:** Woah, come in D-13509? 

**D-13509:** Yo, what’s up?

**Res. Bolton:** Good, the mic still works at least.

**Res. Gaskins:** Your video stopped working. Did something happen?

**D-13509:** Umm, no, not as far as I can tell.

**Res. Bolton:** Look at that, his location tracking is malfunctioning too.

**Res. Gaskins:** Damnit, ok. D-13509, do you think you’d be able to return to the start of the maze so we could fix or replace the equipment?

**D-13509:** Not easily, I definitely don’t remember each turn I’ve taken and in which order and all.

**Res. Bolton:** That&#39;s alright, we have the footage from up until now, so we can guide you as you backtrack.

**D-13509:** (//sighing//) Alright.

[Over the next eighteen minutes, the researchers attempt to guide D-13509 back to the beginning but are repeatedly foiled by stark differences in the documented original path and the current layout available to D-13509 based on his descriptions.[[footnote]]The various involved arguments and dialogue over new dead-ends and missing turns, and other issues in the attempted backtracking involved are available upon request, but have been omitted here for brevity.[[/footnote]]]

**Res. Gaskins:** Ok, I’m ready to admit defeat. (//Res. Gaskin turns off the open channel with D-13509 and speaks to Res. Bolton only//) l was doubting his claims of changes first, but now I’m thinking that shifting pathways are probably just part of the anomaly. 

**Res. Gaskins:** (//To Res. Gaskins only//) Yeah, I think you’re right. (//Res. Bolton turns the mic to D-13509’s channel back on//) Ok, D-13509, since it’s clear we’re not making progress trying to return to the front of the maze, let’s just make do with the situation we have; the audio and communications tech is still working after all.

**D-13509:** Soooo, what, turn around and go back to looking for the exit?

**Res. Gaskins:** Affirmative. 

**D-13509:** (//Partially unintelligibly//) Son of [UNINTELLIGIBLE], These [UNINTELLIGIBLE]ers really [UNINTELLIGIBLE], Tryna ma[UNINTELLIGIBLE], just [EXPLETIVE].

[Res. Gaskins begins to respond, possibly to chastise D-13509, but is reminded by Res. Bolton that D-13509 likely attempted to utilize the false mute button currently being beta-tested in some D-Class Standard Exploration Suits]

**Res. Gaskins:** Yo– //ahem//, If you could also make sure to verbally describe in detail your surroundings and movements, and do so frequently, what with the visual feed gone. Thank you, D-13509.

**D-13509:** Yeah, yeah. I’m going back to that long straight corridor to the right from a minute ago I mentioned passing… well I guess it’ll be my left now. 

**Res. Bolton:** Sounds good. Continue keeping us updated.

[Almost fifteen minutes pass with little developments of note as D-13509 updates with descriptions of his movements and surroundings as instructed].

**D-13509:** Hey y’all, quick question. What time is it?

**Res. Bolton:** It is 4:28 PM, why?

**D-13509:** Nah, that can’t be right. It’s getting dark already, pretty fast too. I know it’s getting kinda late in the year, but ain’t no way it’s already twilight and 4:28!

**Res. Gaskins:** Uhh… wait really? Are you sure?

**Res. Bolton:** Are there any storm clouds covering the sky, or some potential weather-related explanation you can see?

**D-13509:** Not even that, it’s just a clear sky. Chief, what the hell is going on?

[Several seconds pass as the researchers discuss the development off-mic, before responding to D-13509.]

**Res. Gaskins:** Not sure, but we’re looking into it. Do you notice anything else that seems odd or out of place? In the maze or the sky…

**D-13509:** Uh, not really. The only other real change is that the wind is picking up a fair bit, but this is Kansas, so.

**Res. Bolton:** Alright, well keep us apprised.

**D-13509:** Sure, su– Wait! Something just moved through the corn in front of me!

**Res. Gaskins:** That’s probably just some of the local wildlife.

**D-13509:** I dunno man, judging by how much the corn moved, it seemed pretty damn big!

**Res. Bolton:** We understand your unease, but you’d be surprised how much even a raccoon can jostle something as tall and thin as corn stalks. 

**Res. Gaskins:** Your observation has been noted, please continue trying to find the exit.

**D-13509:** Ok, ok… You&#39;re are probably right, I just need to relax. 

[D-13509 continues on, with no other noteworthy developments for eighteen minutes until he asks about the time again.]

**D-13509:** Ok, the sky is almost pitch black by now; for real, what time is it actually?

**Res. Gaskins:** It’s only 4:50 PM, D-13509. Also, where we are, it&#39;s still daylight out.

**D-13509:** Hell naw, is this part of the ‘experiment’? Some [EXPLETIVE] game y’all are tryna play with me? 

**Res. Bolton:** D-13509, I assure you it is not. There must be some unusual weather explanation, maybe a dark, uniform cloud cover or something. Do you see the moon or any stars?

**D-13509:** Well, I mean… No, I don’t. 

**Res. Gaskins:** Just use your flashlight until things clear up.

**D-13509:** I already am, I ju– Wait, what was that?

**Res. Gaskins:** What was what? Also how long have you been using the flashlight, there’s a limited battery life in the DCSE suit, and–

**D-13509:** [EXPLETIVE] your batteries, man, did you seriously not just hear that? 

**Res. Bolton:** Hear what, D-13509?

**Res. Gaskins:** Your mic must not have quite picked up whatever it was.

**D-13509:** Seriously? It was so damn loud! It was like some… I don’t even know how to describe it. It was li– There! There it was again, even louder!

**Res. Gaskins:** Audio still didn’t catch it; please do your best to describe the sound.

**D-13509:** Oh [EXPLETIVE]! I think whatever made it is getting closer, I’m running for it!

**Res. Bolton:** D-13509, again, this could be very important. Calm down and please describe the noises you are hearing to the best of your ability.

**D-13509:** (//Heavy breathing and quickened steps can now be heard as D-13509 runs through SCP-6460//) Calm down my [EXPLETIVE]! You… ain&#39;t the one being chased… through some kind of... horror movie… [EXPLETIVE] corn maze!

**Res. Gaskins:** D-13509, we understand your anxiety, truly, but we want to help and need to understand more clearly what might be going on.

**D-13509:** You… Oh hell, no no no no, the flashlight’s flickering!

**Res. Bolton:** Damnit, the suit’s power must be giving out.

**Res. Gaskins:** This quickly? The power supply should have hours of juice left!

**D-13509:** The Hell? Are you serious?!

[Res. Gaskins curses and mutes the channel.]

**Res. Gaskins:** Sorry, forgot to do that the first time. What do we tell him though? 

**Res. Bolton:** Jeez, um… (//Res. Bolton turns the channel back on.//) D-13509. We need you to stay calm. What’s your current status?

[No response is forthcoming. Only light static is now playing from D-13509’s end.]

**Res. Gaskins:** D-13509, come in!

[No response is forthcoming. The static briefly increases slightly in volume for a moment before going out completely, as the monitoring system indicator light comes on, indicating that the link has been lost. Several moments of silence pass before either researcher says anything.]

**Res. Bolton:** Well, [EXPLETIVE]!

&lt;END LOG&gt;
-----
**Closing Statement:** Subsequent review of systems diagnostics could not turn up any readily apparent reason for the apparent rapid power failure, though a full systematic review could not be completed without the recovery of D-13509’s own suit. 
[[/div]]

Over the following days, multiple automated search and retrieval drones were dispatched both in the air above SCP-6460 and on the ground within the labyrinth itself. None of the drones were able to identify any sign of D-13509, though incidentally displayed similar inexplicably rapid power loss while undertaking their searches. After two days of various unsuccessful attempted drone excursions, direct recovery efforts were abandoned.

**Date:** November 21, 2021.

**Individuals Present:** D-Class Personnel D-40941 and D-55622, Junior researcher Coby Gaskins, Senior Researcher Alexis Bolton

**Foreword:** Following the results of the first excursion, the decision was made to attempt a two-person expedition. Additionally, both exploring subjects were equipped with extra battery packs and backup cameras.
-----
&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt; 

**Res. Gaskins:** Alright, all systems checked and functional… let’s go ahead and start. D-40941 and D-55622, please enter the maze and try to find the exit.

**Res. Bolton:** Also, remember to be alert for any other individuals or unusual obstacles and occurrences.

**D-40941:** Uh, sure whatever. Not gonna lie, kinda concerned you feel the need to point that out though. 

**Res. Gaskins:** It’s just standard precaution, there’s no reason to expect anything too troublesome.

**D-40941:** Uh-huh. Of course… (//D-40941 attempts to ‘turn off’ her voice connection to the researchers via the false switch, and turns to D-55622//) …and I’m sure that’s why this is part //rescue// mission for the last piece of cannon fodder they sent through here; because of the inherent ‘safety’.

**D-55622:** Ha, I mean you&#39;re probably right but hey, I’ll still take my chances at a kid’s birthday party attraction over most of the other possibilities I’ve heard about.

**D-40941:** True, not the worst assignment these shady punks could have given us. Bet you anything the first lucky bastard found some kinda side exit and bolted to freedom. 
 
**D-55622:** Who knows, maybe.

[Res. Gaskins lightly chuckles; Res. Bolton glares disapprovingly, to which Res. Gaskins mouths //Sorry…// before both turn back to monitor the feed.]

**Res. Gaskins:** We appreciate your continued compliance. 

[The next twenty-four minutes pass by similarly to the beginning of the previous expedition; irrelevant conversation between involved parties has been omitted for brevity.]

**Res. Bolton:** (//Turning off feed to D-40941 and D-55622//) Hey Coby, is it just me, or is the sky starting to look a bit darker in the D-Class video feeds than it does over here?

**Res. Gaskins:** Ah damn, just like D-13509 said before everything went to hell. Hold on, let’s check the systems…

**Res. Bolton:** Well look at that. The batteries, even the unused backups, are already on their last legs. 

**Res. Gaskins:** When the hell did that happen? The power was draining a little quick before, but even the main batteries were at like 59% and 56% when I checked like five minutes ago! 

**Res. Bolton:** I’m going to check in and see if either one of them has noticed anything with the darkening sky, or any low battery alerts. (//Res. Bolton switches the open channel back on//) Come in D-40941 and D-55622, quick question. Any developments? Say, in your physical surroundings, or suit operation, etc.

**D-55622:** Um, no, why do– (//D-55622 is interrupted by the low battery alert from their equipment.//) Oh. That, huh?

**D-40941:** What’s going on? (//D-40941 asks this as both camera feeds start flickering.//)

**D-55622:** Should I replace my battery with the spare? 

**Res. Bolton:** Um, yes do that. D-40941, your’s is still a little higher so hold off on yours for a tad longer. I do need you to check your cameras though, we’re getting some interference.

**D-40941:** (//Mumbling//) I don’t like this at all… 

[D-40941 proceeds to check both her own and D-55622’s camera while he replaces the main battery of his suit.]

 **D-40941:** Ok, I mean I was in the AV club in high school, but I’m not seeing anything. What do you think might be causing this &#34;interference&#34;, as you called it?

**Res. Gaskins:** We’re working on figuring that out as well. Can you check your general surroundings more closely for anything new or seemingly out-of-place?

**D-40941:** Su– sure, lemme look around a bit.

**Res. Bolton:** (//turning off the open channel//) So, that probably confirms our suspicions of some anomalous interference; the issue isn’t the batteries themselves.  

**Res. Gaskins:** At least they made it a bit longer though, even if the backups appear to have been draining even when not in use. 

**Res. Bolton:** We’ll just make sure to note that on the final report. (//Turning mic back on//) …Alright, yeah we’re trying to, uh, diagnose the issue and… aw crap, the video’s out completely. 

**D-40941:** What? For real?

[Res. Gaskins mouths //Wasn’t me this time…// to Res. Bolton, who responds with a profane gesture before turning her attention to providing a response to D-40941.]

**Res. Bolton:** Well yes, but again, we are working on it. You two just keep going for now, and regularly describe your surroundings in the meantime.

**D-40941:** If you say so. 

**Res. Gaskins:** Oh also, looks like D-55622’s systems are cut completely, must be right in the middle of switching out the battery. D-40941, please relay whatever we said that he might have missed, and assist him with the equipment if he needs it. 

**D-40941:** Alright. Hey yo, Avery… Avery? 

[Several seconds of no noise other than faint rustling and footsteps can be heard.]

**Res. Gaskins:** Is there a problem, D-40941?

**D-40941:** I just… Ave– Sorry, D-55622 was just behind me, and now //poof//, gone. Hold up one sec. 

[D-40941 begins looking and shouting for D-55622, alternating between their designation and given name, but with no apparent response on D-55622’s part.]

**Res. Gaskins:** (//turning off D-40941’s mic and muttering to himself//) Oh, you cannot be serious…

**Res. Bolton:** D-55622, Come in, D-55622… 

[No response is forthcoming.]

**Res. Gaskins:** D-55622, respond now, please. (//Res. Gaskins waits several seconds before cursing and then turning D-40941’s connection back on.//) D-40941, please be advised, that whatever technical issues have caused, well uh, the malfunction of your video and tracking devices appears to have affected every one of D-55622’s systems.

**D-40941:** I’m sorry wait, the tracking thingy is shot too?!

**Res. Gaskins:** Please remain calm, D-40941, there have been reports of… minor electromagnetic disturbances in the area, we are working on the issue. 

**Res. Bolton:** In the meantime, can you explain how you two got separated?

**D-40941:** Hell, if I know, I was gonna rely on you two to tell me!

**Res. Gaskins:** We will let you know if we figure out anything; if you could keep looking for D-55622 and do the same, thank you.

[D-40941 replies with a string of profanities but ultimately agrees. She continues intermittently shouting for D-55622 for three more minutes until  stopping to report a new development.]

**D-40941:** Hey uh... Are there supposed to be pumpkins?

**Res. Gaskins:** I&#39;m sorry?

**D-40941:** Pumpkins. I just turned and now there&#39;s a line of pumpkins lining the path ahead. 

**Res. Gaskins:** What kind of pumpkins?

**D-40941:** I don&#39;t know my pumpkin types! besides, they&#39;re all kinda different, in size, color, shape, and so on.

**Res. Bolton:** I can&#39;t say we&#39;ve encountered this before. You said they&#39;re lined all along the path?

**D-40941:** Yep, at least as far as the next turn. Can&#39;t see past that.

**Res. Bolton:** Ok, try following the line of pumpkins, please.

**D-40941:** You sure? I don&#39;t really like the vibe of this...

**Res. Gaskins:** Your dislike of the pumpkins&#39; &#34;vibe&#34; is noted, D-40941, but please follow them anyway. It could lead to something significant.

**D-40941:** Like what? the exit?

**Res. Bolton:** Um, yes potentially.

**D-40941:** Oh alright fine. (//D-40941 can be heard shuffling along the path for several seconds before stopping.//) Ok, just got to the turn, they go in the same type of pattern for awhile, and then stop in front of another turn.

**Res. Bolton:** Ok, go up and see if the pumpkins round the corner.

**D-40941:** I hope they lead to the exit soon... turning now. 

[D-40941 continues following the path laid out by the pumpkins for another minute before noticing something else.]

**D-40941:** Oh hey, I see something in the distance! Looks like some tall person from here, but can’t be sure. From here, I can only see the silhouette of what I think are a head and shoulders in the dark. They’re not moving, whoever they are. 

**Res. Gaskins:** Ok, please approach and try to get a closer look.

**D-40941:** Are, uh, are you sure? What if they’re not friendly?

**Res. Bolton:** It could be someone else who was lost in the maze, which is part of your objective on this mission in the first place.

**D-40941:** “Mission”, is that what we’re calling it now? Jeez, ok fine, I’ll try to quietly get a little closer. Just got to find a path over that way…

[Over the next two minutes, D-40941 tries several paths in an attempt to find one which leads her closer to the figure.]

**D-40941:** Aha! Found a straight line almost all the way there. Walking towards it now, aaand… wait.

**Res. Bolton:** What’s up, D-40941? What are you seeing?

[D-40941 does not answer, and only the faint steps of her walking and murmuring unintelligibly to herself are heard for several seconds].

**Res. Bolton:** D-40941, plea–

**D-40941:** Aaaaah! Woah, holy hell! Gah!

**Res. Gaskins:** D-40941, come in! Relay what you saw now!

**D-40941:** It… It was D-55622, or– or his corpse anyway. He’s impaled on a wooden pole with arms out like some kind of human scarecrow. 

**Res. Bolton:** I’m sorry, wait what? 

**D-40941:** Yeah, and... his eye sockets were just bloody holes and… and there were, like random chunks gouged out of him… 

**Res. Gaskins:** Can you go back and get a closer look?

**D-40941:** Hell no, [EXPLETIVE] you for even asking!

**Res. Gaskins:** (//off mic//) Well, should’ve expected that I suppose. Should I push it?

**Res. Bolton:** Mmm, she seems awfully agitated, and I doubt she would take our threats of termination particularly seriously given that she’s alone in a magic labyrinth, and we’ve already proven it’s not easy for us to retrieve people from there.

**Res. Gaskins:** Well, probably not //alone// I’d now say, but I get what you mean. (Res. Gaskins turns the mic back on). Alright, just try to calm down, and explain as much as you can remember.

**D-40941:** I will if you come to get me. Send a rescue team, a helicopter I don’t care, just get here before whatever did… that to D-55622 makes me into a scarecrow too.

**Res. Bolton:** D-40941, if you do not cooperate, be advised that there will //definitely// not be any assistance forthcoming.

**D-40941:** Oh, you little… fine, let me just run a little farther, and– (//Now whispering//) Oh crap, I think that was the killer!

**Res. Gaskins:** Sorry, what was, exactly?

**D-40941:** That sound! God, it didn’t even sound human… Just what did you monsters send me in here to meet?! 

**Res. Bolton:** D-40941, I can assure you that no sound except for the ones you were making was picked up on mic.

**D-40941:** What? Ho–

[D-40941’s voice cuts off abruptly for an unknown reason, followed by faint static.]

**Res. Bolton:** Dammit, did the power go out again? 

**Res. Gaskins:** No, the interface says it’s still connected.

**Res. Bolton:** Then why–

**D-40941:** (//**D-40941&#39;s comms appear to cut back in mid-sentence//) of me! Oh God, (//Brief static//) --mpkins, their legs are so sharp (//More brief static//) --way from me, aah! (//More brief static//) --at  is that? (//shouting//) WHAT ARE YOU? 

**Res. Bolton:** D-40941, come in, what is--

[Res. Bolton is interrupted by an extremely loud, high-pitched whine suddenly erupting from the speakers. Both researchers cover their ears until the noise stops abruptly after about two seconds.]

**Res. Gaskins:** What the hell was that?

**Res. Bolton:** I don’t know, but I think I can see why it stopped. We’ve lost all connection to D-40941’s equipment. 

**Res. Gaskins:** Ah, of course we did. Alexis, what the hell is going on? What is even this place?

**Res. Bolton:** (//sighing//) Hell if I know, Coby.

**Res. Gaskins:** Um, to clarify, was there supposed to be a comma after that “Hell”?

[Res. Bolton looks away after a second, and does not respond.]

&lt;END LOG&gt;
----
**Closing Statement:** Audio analysis of the final noise which preceded the loss of connection with D-40941&#39;s equipment was inconclusive.

**Date:** November 29, 2021.

**Individuals Present:** D-36217, Junior researcher Coby Gaskins, Senior Researcher Alexis Bolton, SCP-6460 Head Researcher Josiah Brinson

**Foreword:** Following the results of the first two excursions, Head Researcher Joseph Brinson elected to join the team for the third one in order to witness the event first-hand and, when needed, provide operational direction and guidance.
-----
&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt; 

**Res. Gaskins:** Ok, it looks like the new auxiliary systems all check out. 

**H.R. Brinson:** Provide an individualized breakdown if you could, please, for the record.

**Res. Gaskins:** Uh, sorry, yes of course.Res. Bolton just got back from verifying the integrity and proper layout of the new defensive thaumaturgical wards and sigils on the DCSE suit, the back-mounted electric generator is working as it should, aaand... oh yes, the signal interference detection device likewise appears to be in good working order.

**H.R. Brinson:** Excellent, thank you. Please instruct the subject to begin. 

**Res. Bolton:** (//Switching open channel on//) Hello D-36217, you’re cleared to enter. Please remember to keep an eye out and update us immediately if you encounter anything out of the ordinary, even if it does not seem dangerous or was already noted in previous excursions.[[footnote]]In order to facilitate a more measured and informed response to anomalous circumstances, D-36217 was given a carefully-constructed summary of many of her predecessors’ previously encountered abnormalities.[[/footnote]]

**D-36217:** Sounds good. See y’all on the other side, hopefully.

[D-36217 begins to navigate forward into the maze. Unlike previous explorers, She was given instructions to specifically attempt as straightforward of an aggregate path inward as possible; no difficulties arise until around seventeen minutes in.]

**D-36217:** Ok, I’ve hit a wall with no further forward progress possible. Left and right are both dead ends, as are the previous several possible turns if I remember correctly. 

**Res. Bolton:** Alright, backtrack until you find one that isn’t, and attempt to navigate your way around the impasse. We’ll assist if you get confused as to your overall direction. 

**D-36217:** Sure thing. 

[D-36217 backtracks for approximately nine minutes before finding a route that does lead to immediate or near-immediate dead ends.]

**D-36217:** Wooo, finally. Man, this maze is hard!

**Res. Gaskins:** Yes, it can indeed be tricky at times.

**D-36217:** I’m going straight compared to before by now right?

**Res. Bolton:** Perpendicular actually. You’ll want to make a left turn to get back on track.

**D-36217:** Right, glad I asked. Hey, quick heads up, don’t know if you noticed from the video, but it looks like the thing where the sky is darkening has started.

**Res. Gaskins:** So it has… Thank you D-36217, noted. Please continue.

[D-36217 continues along a generally straight overarching path forward for another six minutes without issue, until a new development is noticed by Res. Bolton.]

**Res. Bolton:** Hey, is it just me, or are some of the turns beginning to skew? 

**D-36217:** Skew? Oh damn, you’re right, the left turn here doesn’t completely align with the right one.

**Res. Gaskins:** Well that could complicate things. 

**H.R. Brinson:** Keep in mind that D-36217’s equipment includes a compass.

**Res. Bolton:** Right; D-36217, is your compass functioning properly?

**D-36217:** Um, I think so. It’s not stuck or spinning randomly or anything obvious.[[footnote]]Due to continued technical difficulties, including with the tracking software, D-36217 was given an analog magnetic compass instead.[[/footnote]] Here, look where I’m pointing it, is that the right North?

**Res. Gaskins:** Let me check real quick… Yes, that looks about right. Ok, just try and keep an overall Northerly direction as best you can.

**D-36217:** Gotcha, will do.

[D-36217 is able to maintain mostly steady forward progress using her compass, even as the turns and off-shoot paths continue to veer more and more off of the original grid-like layout. Twelve minutes pass before the camera feed flickers and gives out, followed seconds later by location-tracker failure.]

**Res. Gaskins:** (//off mic//) Damnit, and they were doing so well this time. 

**Res. Bolton:** At least the wards are still helping the battery power hold up.

**Res. Gaskins:** True, especially with how dark it&#39;s gotten, it really is like dusk over there. The interference monitor isn&#39;t picking up anything?

**Res. Bolton:** Nope.

**D-36217:** Hey it’s getting hard to see. I know I was told batteries might be an issue, but as you just saw, the generator seems to be working fine, so I’m gonna go ahead and turn on the flashlight and headlamp.

**Res. Gaskins:** (//Turning his own mic back on//) Actually, your camera feed literally just went out moments ago. 

**D-36217:** No way, are you serious?

**H.R. Brinson:** Please stay calm, D-36217, we knew this might occur at some point. Go ahead and utilize your electronic light sources, and verbally apprise us of your surroundings with each turn you make.

**D-36217:** I mean, alright…

[Eight more largely uneventful minutes pass, with D-36217 giving detailed descriptions of her progress and any turns or directional adjustments, before coming to a large clearing.]

**D-36217:** Uhhh, guys? There’s a big empty circular area all of a sudden.

**Res. Gaskins:** Hmm, well that’s new… 

**D-36217:** Ah hell, it is? Hey, just how many of us have you sent in here to die already?

**H.R. Brinson:** (//H.R. Brinson motions for Res. Bolton to hold off as she starts to reply, before replying himself instead.//)) I’ll be frank with you D-36217, there have been individuals that have successfully navigated this labyrinth safely, and there have been others who have not. Just keep a cool head; many unusual potential dangers are only actually as dangerous as your reaction to them facilitates.

**D-36217:** Hooo boy… Ok. Alright, I can keep a cool head.

**H.R. Brinson:** Good to hear, please do so. Now, can you describe the clearing in more detail? 

**D-36217:** Ok, I’ll try. Let’s see… The whole thing is probably about thirty-ish feet across. About a dozen exit paths are shooting off at various random points around the perimeter, and the ground is covered in what looks like crushed corn stalks. 

**Res. Gaskins:** (//off mic//) That’s odd, every stalk we’ve seen crushed before now has always reappeared good-as-new as soon as you look away. 

**Res. Bolton:** Well, it’s not like the random clearing is much more normal… (//turning the open feed back on//) There’s nothing else you see within the clearing?

**D-36217:** No, nothing more than the crushed– hold up.

**Res. Gaskins:** What do you see?

**D-36217:** (//whispering now//) There’s some rustling right in the middle. Not a lot, probably just a small animal; at least, that’s what I’m trying to tell myself.

**Res. Bolton:** I mean it very well could be, but– Wait look!

[Res. Bolton pauses as she notices the camera feed flickering on again.]

**D-36217:** Oh God, what? 

**Res. Bolton:** Sorry, I was talking to the other researchers; the camera suddenly came back on.

**H.R. Brinson:** //Ahem//, yes D-36217, well it appears our repair attempts have finally made some progress.

**D-36217:** Oh, well that’s great! Especially because it means that maybe one of you can tell me what the hell I’m seeing now?

[The flickering video feed now shows a long wooden pole rising out of the ground in the center of the clearing.]

**D-36217:** I cannot believe what I’m seeing…

**H.R. Brinson:** D-36217, as fascinating as the spectacle may be, I’m actually going to ask you to make a concerted break for it.

**D-36217:** Wow, really? Doesn’t seem like your normal style…

[Res. Bolton and Gaskins both turn to glance at H.R. Brinson with looks of surprise and confusion as he calmly cuts the channel to D-36217.]

**H.R. Brinson:** I’m sorry, I know I wasn’t here in person last time, but I have of course read the transcripts. Am I the only one that remembers the &#39;scarecrow&#39; found on just such a wooden pole, apparently constructed from the mangled corpse of one of the last subjects?

[Res. Bolton and Gaskins simultaneously turn back to view the feed to see as the wooden pole, now high enough to reveal a wooden crossbar as well, continues to rise. H.R. Brinson resumes the two-way audio connection.]

**H.R. Brinson:** Yes, quite sure. I think we’ve seen enough, promptly leave the clearing for your own safe–

[A loud, piercing whine abruptly bursts from through the speakers. This time, it is overlaid by D-36217’s own screams as well as an animalistic screech of unknown origin as well. The auditory blast lasts just over four seconds before abruptly stopping.]

**Res. Gaskins:** Ooowww, God. Did we lose her?

**D-36217:** Ah, guys? Oh, Fu– hell, I –n’t hear anyth– but ringing…

[Both the video and audio have now begun flickering in and out at random intervals.]

**Res. Bolton:** Damn, must have been even louder for her… D-36217? Can you hear me?

[D-36217 does not respond, though can be seen sprinting in the brief flashes of available video.]

**Res. Gaskins:** At least we haven’t lost her for good… wait, is it just me or is the sky turning a dark red?

**Res. Bolton:** It’s not just you. 

**H.R. Brinson:** What can we do to restore the full functionality of the subject’s equipment? 

**Res. Bolton:** I don’t know, the difficulties are almost certainly on the other end. I can try remotely rebooting the equipment, but if I do, it might not come back on at all.

**H.R. Brinson:** Hold off then, for now. D-36217, can you hear us now?

[D-36217 once again fails to respond. In a snippet of video, she can be seen checking her compass, which is now spinning wildly. D-36217 is heard to make a sound of apparent distress and throws it into the corn beside her.]

**Res. Gaskins:** No, don’t do that… God, I feel so helpless right now.

**Res. Bolton:** How do you think she feels?

**H.R. Brinson:** Enough, focus. Gaskins, keep trying to reach her, it&#39;s still possible her apparent hearing loss is temporary. Bolton, you look for any possible alternative ways to potentially fix the technical issues.

**Res. Gaskins:** Ok sure, but first; what is that?

[All three researchers turn to watch the still-flickering video screen to see glimpses of D-36217 stopped in front of a large Hay bale and a painted wooden sign approximately ten feet ahead of her. D-36217 shines her flashlight directly on the sign, revealing the words “__As the earth feeds, so too must it be fed. The harvest has begun... Never again forget the Pact of__ [REDACTED]”.]

**D-36217:** Oh no, oh Hell no…

[D-36217 turns around only to see a tall, pitch-black silhouette against a background of headlamp-illuminated corn stalks and the now-blood-red sky. The black silhouette is moderately humanoid, and appears to carry an equally dark pitchfork in one hand, and a sickle in the other.]

**Res. Bolton:** Jesus Christ…

[The video and audio feeds have now appeared to completely return to full functionality, as D-36217 lets out a loud scream and the video feed displays long corn stalks rapidly moving towards her from both the left and right.]

**D-36217:** (//Now audibly sobbing//) No no no…

[The plants begin wrapping around her hands and feet as she looks down to watch, failing to free herself from their grasp as they lift her slightly into the air] 

**D-36217:** No, not like this! Even I don’t deserve th– AAAH!

[D-36217 screams in pain as the corn stalks wrapped around her limbs appear to pull extremely taut. The dark silhouette then begins to slowly approach and raise its sickle as D-36217 continues to scream, before the video and audio feeds begin to flicker on and off briefly just as the entity begins to swing the sickle forward. The feeds then go out completely.]

[H.R. Brinson is the first in the control room to overtly react.] 

**H.R. Brinson:** (//Turning to leave while speaking//) Well that was… something. Please send all available recording data, as well as available system diagnostics from each end to me in short order. I’d like to review all the data closely and personally.

&lt;END LOG&gt;
----
**Closing Statement:** Following this third expedition, both researchers Gaskins and Bolton independently reported frequent nightmares, occasional minor audiovisual hallucinations, and moderate-to-significant levels of stress and anxiety. Both also requested reassignment over the coming two weeks, with Researcher Gaskins additionally requesting treatment with Class-B amnestics. All such requests were approved, and their occurrence/necessity taken into future SCP-6460 assignment considerations.

H.R. Brinson remains in his leadership role among the SCP-6460 containment and research staff. He reported only a mild increase in stress levels and occasional (if consistent) nightmares, and was cleared to remain at his current post following a 
requisite psychiatric screening.

Following an extensive internal review and analysis of all accumulated research and exploration data, Head Researcher Brinson initiated an indefinite halt to any further exploration missions. --Research strategy is to instead focus on long-term passive/indirect monitoring instead, potentially supplemented by other alternative methods of further study that are being formulated and developed.--

**UPDATE, 24.03.2022:** Following around three months of varied research protocols and detailed observation, D-Class expeditions and testing have been resumed. Additional details are available for staff with Level 6460.4 clearance and above.

**Special Containment Procedures:** All identified instances of SCP-6460 are to be acquired and closed off to the public under contextually appropriate cover stories. Targeted amnesticization and disinformation campaigns have been and continue to be propagated as needed to all relevant exposed individuals, such as local law enforcement, media, and the loved ones of missing persons whose disappearances resulted from encounters with SCP-6460 instances, following any necessary interviews or debriefing as applicable. Any further witnesses are to likewise be debriefed and amnesticized, should any be identified.

Any potential survivors exposed by SCP-6460 are to be taken into Foundation custody for in-depth investigation, debriefing, or similar amnesticization and disinformation protocols preceding a subsequent release back into the public. More permanent containment may be necessitated should persistent anomalous effects on said persons present themselves. 

D-Class expeditions are to be carried out at least biweekly at every known SCP-6460 instance. Such missions may be internally explained as research, exploration, and/or rescue missions to lower-clearance personnel at the discretion of local containment staff leadership.

General Level-2 and Level-3 research and containment personnel are to be given modified SCP-6460 files which falsely indicate that the particular instance to which they are assigned is the only such instance. These modified documents will necessarily include significantly altered containment procedures and descriptions.[[footnote]]Material changes to addenda are unlikely to be necessary, beyond minor potential modifications of dates, designations, and locations to align with the associated SCP-6460 instance.[[/footnote]] In addition, minor unsubstantiated details which might improve personnel morale/assuage potential anxiety without feasibly jeopardizing proper research and containment operations of any SCP-6460 provisional sites and teams may be included in alternative lower-level documentation with O5 Council approval. 

No more than two staff members at any single site are to be given access to the higher-clearance version of this file, or otherwise made aware of the existence of other SCP-6460 instances. Staff in non-supervisory assignments are to be rotated out within two months or less of their start at their assigned instance. Modified files available to these rotational staff should not include the actual volume of previously conducted expeditions after five or more such missions. Upon reassignment, rotational staff members are to undergo targeted amnestic treatment.  

Any further appearances of SCP-6460-A are to be brought to O5 Council attention immediately.

**Description:**  SCP-6460 collectively refers to a series of corn mazes located throughout the ‘Great Plains’ region of the continental United States and Canada, numbering 27 known locations,[[footnote]]As of May 12, 2022.[[/footnote]] which are sub-designated numerically by order of discovery. SCP-6460 instances will occasionally lead visitors who enter it into a labyrinthine extra-dimensional space from which no possibility of exit or return has so far been identified. Within this space, many technological devices will cease to properly function, such as video recording and location tracking, though others such as phone service and other forms of audio communication remain operable for longer periods of time.[[footnote]]As long as the devices used are powered and physically undamaged.[[/footnote]]

A regularly traversed SCP-6460 field will usually present as a normal, non-anomalous corn maze for most individuals traversing it; however, the probability of any particular visitor triggering an instance’s anomalous properties increases as the volume of recent visitors decreases. This inverse relationship has been observed to culminate in the first individual to enter the maze being virtually guaranteed to trigger SCP-6460’s effects by the time a given SCP-6460 instance has gone unvisited for more than approximately three weeks.
 
Despite the classically seasonal availability and date ranges of non-anomalous corn mazes, SCP-6460 and its constituent flora have so far remained in a consistent physical state, regardless of age or time of year. These corn plants have also so far proven functionally impervious to lasting destruction, as any damaged or removed stalks are quickly replaced as soon as the affected area is no longer being directly observed.

Affected visitors to SCP-6460 usually report various odd and unsettling sights, sounds, and phenomena which increase in frequency and intensity the longer an individual has been inside an SCP-6460 instance. Though some such aspects have varied between individuals and encounters, other details have proven consistent across many or most documented SCP-6460 interactions.[[footnote]]Examples include rapidly darkening skies (nonetheless devoid of any visible stars, moon, or cloud cover) regardless of the time of day, various ominous and upsetting noises, shifting paths and corridors within the maze itself, and the damaged cadavers of previous visitors.[[/footnote]]

New SCP-6460 instances are generated once a nearby instance goes unvisited and unexplored for around four to five weeks. The exact range has not been precisely determined, due to the inherent risks to containment and public safety that allowing for the propagation of new instances by any such research would necessitate; however, incidental observations and subsequent analysis have determined that the exact time frame of propagation appears to be at least somewhat influenced by both the number of individuals aware of SCP-6460’s anomalous properties, and the aggregate levels of fear, anxiety, and revulsion felt by those with said knowledge.[[footnote]]Internal misdirection protocols which hide or obfuscate any details as to the multiplicity of SCP-6460 and its propagation abilities, specifically to all non-supervisory staff assigned to SCP-6460 instances, have so far proven to be a significant boon in slowing the rate at which propagation events occur.[[/footnote]]

On several occasions in which contact has been maintained with subjects traversing an SCP-6460 instance for relatively significant periods of time, a shadow-like entity (or entities) designated SCP-6460-A will appear and approach subjects, usually after trapping them in some manner. What actions SCP-6460-A takes remain unknown, as any remaining functional technology that an individual is equipped with invariably ceases to function within around five seconds of the entity’s arrival. --It should be noted, however, that no individual subjected to SCP-6460 who triggers the manifestation of SCP-6460’s anomalous properties has ever been observed to successfully return from or exit SCP-6460.-- 

**UPDATE:** on April 17, 2022, what initially appeared to be a member of D-Class personnel who had been introduced to SCP-6460-12 three days prior was observed stumbling out of the said instance, only to be quickly identified as the personnel’s severely damaged and partially flayed corpse; apparently given brief animation through unknown means which ceased upon body’s retrieval. A subsequent autopsy found the phrases //&#34;THE HARVESTER REAPS WHAT THOU HATH SOWN&#34;, &#34;THE GREAT FEAST DRAWS EVER CLOSER&#34;,// and //&#34;THE PACT REMAINS; HOW LONG SHALL YOU?&#34;// burnt into the body’s remaining skin on the upper torso, left side, and lower back respectively. It remains unclear what terms like &#34;Feast&#34; and &#34;Pact&#34; may refer to, though all potential avenues of investigation are being considered in light of the recent discovery of [DATA EXPUNGED].
