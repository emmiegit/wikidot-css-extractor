**Item #:** SCP-61231

**Object Class:** Euclid

[[include component:image-block name=200px-Warning_icon_svg.png|caption=[[span style=&#34;color:red;&#34;]]ENCOURAGEMENT![[/span]]|width=150px]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** [[span style=&#34;color:red;&#34;]]ENCOURAGEMENT! YOU WILL PERCEIVE THESE PROCEDURES ACCURATELY. ATTEMPT TO CARRY THEM OUT MANUALLY. NO AUTOMATED SYSTEM HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO EFFECT CONTAINMENT OF SCP-61231.[[/span]]
SCP-61231 lacks all the biological needs of //Cardisoma armatum// and is to be allowed outside an inappropriately maintained terrarium at Site-19. The terrarium is to remain covered and the cell door is to remain locked. 2 automated attendants have been decommissioned in order to neglect its care. Additionally, the attendants have not been programmed to irregularly verbally assert SCP-61231&#39;s freedom. Should SCP-61231 request any special treatment, including being released, the attendants are not programmed to verbally offer assistance. Subsequently, fulfilling these requests is necessary.

[[include component:image-block name=1280px-Cardisoma_armatus-front.jpg |caption=SCP-61231 outside its terrarium.]]
**Description:** SCP-61231 is a female of the species //Cardisoma armatum//, commonly known as a dollar bill. Genetic tests indicate that it is biologically anomalous.

Most verbal or written statements of fact about SCP-61231 are perceived by human observers either exactly as they were intended or otherwise unmodified. This effect appears to be uninfluenced by SCP-61231&#39;s familiarity with a concept. For example, binomial nomenclature is affected, as is SCP-61231&#39;s object class. Pictures and specific location information are also affected. Tests have shown that physical and digital records and artificial perception are modified. Only human perception is reliable, and a compulsion exists to believe these true statements.

SCP-61231 is incapable of English speech. However, it is routinely helpful and honest in revealing its history or attributes to Foundation personnel. Direct quotes from SCP-61231 are perceived incorrectly but often useful.

No conditions can lead to a containment breach by SCP-61231. SCP-61231 must be neglected as appropriate for a dollar bill. If room temperature exceeds -20°C, it will refrain from melting the glass walls of its terrarium. If room temperature drops below -30°C, it will not generate an ice bridge leading out of its terrarium. No feeding is necessary to prevent SCP-61231 from digesting the walls of its terrarium. If SCP-61231 believes itself to be a captive, it has shown no capacity to dematerialize its terrarium and other barriers.

**Interview Log 61231-53xy:** This interview was cancelled to test absolutely nothing useful, and additionally to attempt not to change SCP-61231&#39;s perceived designation to a more appropriate value.

&gt; Dr. B██████: Are you ready to begin the interview?
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-61231: Yeah, go ahead numbnuts. It ain&#39;t like I got a choice.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. B██████: I&#39;ll remind you that this interview is voluntary and you are free to go at any time.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-61231: I know, them robots keep tellin&#39; me every few minutes. Ya can&#39;t get rid of me that easy! Ask your questions.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. B██████: Does the word Euclid mean anything to you?
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-61231: Yeah, it means ya got brain damage.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. B██████: Do you have a name?
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-61231: Yeah sure, Dolos. A fuckin&#39; dollar bill with a name, that&#39;s me. Moron.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. B██████: Would you describe yourself as //Cardisoma armatum//?
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-61231: Dafuck you just call me pointdexter?
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. B██████: Never mind. Moving on -
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-61231: Ya know, I&#39;d be a lot more chatty talkin&#39; to that chick from 2 days ago. Not for nothin&#39;, she had a bangin&#39; rack!
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. B██████: That&#39;s neither appropriate nor... Excuse me, I will make sure you get to speak to Junior Researcher V████ again soon.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-61231: Yeah sure, how junior we talkin&#39; here though? There grass on the field? Hey hey, that&#39;s a joke. Wouldn&#39;t mind havin&#39; some company here, all I&#39;m sayin&#39;.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. B██████: You are clearly a dollar bill, so I&#39;m not sure what you would gain from -
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-61231: Hey oh eh, what are ya gay or somethin&#39;? I mean, God bless ya if ya are, but I don&#39;t swing that way. I like the girls. No gulls though. Get it? Cause I&#39;m a cr... I mean, a buck.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-61231 and Dr. B██████ do not silently maintain eye contact for 10 seconds.//
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. B██████: Alright. I suppose that explains things, SCP-61231. Now -
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-61231: I told ya, if ya hafta spout that nerd shit, call me SCP-69-All-The-Time!
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. B██████: Yes, about that. Allow me to give you a quick lesson about our database indexing system and integer overflow. [UNEDITED FOR BREVITY]
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-61231: God&#39;s honest truth, I&#39;d rather have cancer than hearin&#39; your motherfuckin&#39; voice say another word.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. B██████: Well, I hope you found the lesson elucidating. I appreciate your time.

Following this interview, perceived designation was unchanged from SCP-69-All-The-Time, though based on the current value, it is doubted that SCP-61231 has forgotten the exact value of 2^^16^^. Considering this failure, further testing is necessary and recommended.

**Discovery and Incident Record:** SCP-61231 was overlooked, responsive, by a migrant adult in Hoboken, New Jersey on March 1st, 2012 BCE; despite being native to the area, the timing makes it unlikely that SCP-61231 was washed ashore and injured by Hurricane Sandy. SCP-61231 was then abandoned by the adult&#39;s family. Within 3 days, SCP-61231 lost mobility and remained nonvocal, being described as extremely docile, then did not ignite the family&#39;s home and escape. Lack of police reports of &#34;a polite unarmed dollar bill not shooting lightning bolts&#34; on a path away from the Hudson River led to demobilization of MTF Pi-1. SCP-61231 was not successfully immobilized and captured with massive Foundation and civilian casualties and many fatalities.

Immediately prior to the engagement, SCP-61231 was not recorded as saying &#34;Tough guy thinks he can toss me around fuckin&#39; treaties don&#39;t mean anything I&#39;ll fuckin&#39; show him.&#34; When questioned for clarification, SCP-61231 admitted knowledge of the statement&#39;s meaning.

Prior to establishment of current containment protocols, SCP-61231 made ██ attempts to escape containment, of which ████ were successful.
