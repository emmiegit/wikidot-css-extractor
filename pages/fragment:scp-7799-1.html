**Written Report**
 
Perseus drive up to the SCP-7799 Research and Containment Headquarters&#39; security booth to enter with permission. The on-site security guards approach the unauthorized vehicle before realizing it is Perseus. They apologize and immediately give them access to the facility to meet with Dr. Bimston at once, who has been informed of their return. He had reportedly jumped from his office chair and sprinted downstairs in an unprofessional manner to meet Perseus.

[Perseus walks through the sliding glass doors of HQ to the reception desk while accompanied by armed guards. The receptionist looks up and stares with disbelief.] 
 
**Receptionist:** Can I help you... wait, is that-
 
**Guard:** Yes, it&#39;s Perseus. They arrived at the front gate ten minutes ago. Could you grant us access to meet Dr. Bimston? 
 
**Receptionist:** Oh, of course! Apologies for not thinking that sooner! Come on in! 
 
[The receptionist buzzes them in, and Perseus enters the main hall of the facility. They are met with the surprised faces of researchers who hours ago believed they were dead.] 
  
**???:** Is that Perseus? 
 
**??? #2:** They&#39;re alive! 
 
**??? #3:** It can&#39;t be! 
 
[Dr. Bimston jogs toward Perseus and greets them with a hug for each member.]
  
**Bimston:** You&#39;re alive! I can&#39;t believe it, you&#39;re alive! Every single one of you no less! 
 
**Calabasas:** It wasn&#39;t easy, but with my staunch leadership in even the darkest of moments, I saved the exploration.
 
**Vladivostok:** There was us too, though- 
  
**Bimston:** Calabasas my friend, you&#39;re the greatest man I&#39;ve ever met! You did it! 
 
**Calabasas:** Yes, I have. [Chuckle] Don&#39;t mention it.
 
**Bimston:** [Sniffs] Damn, you guys smell like shit. 
 
**Lancaster:** That&#39;s the smell of being trapped in a desert warzone for three days straight. 
 
**Bimston:** Well, that doesn&#39;t matter anymore. Welcome home, Perseus. I can now successfully say that this exploration was a major success. 
 
[Dr. Pen rushes to Perseus as well.]
 
**Pen:** You&#39;re alive! [Laughs] It&#39;s a miracle! A genuine miracle! How&#39;d you get out of there?! 
 
**Calabasas:** My intellect and effectiveness, of course. 
 
**Vladivostok:** We helped too- 
 
**Pen:** Thank you, Roger. Thank you, thank you, thank you for saving us from absolute embarrassment! I thought I would have to resign just out of humiliation! 
 
**Bimston:** But I have one question, though. 
 
**Lancaster:** Can we please just get to the showers, I&#39;m stinking like hell right here- 
 
**Calabasas:** Ask away. 
 
[Lancaster groans. A crowd of thrilled researchers gathers around them.] 
  
**Bimston:** Why did you ghost us halfway through? You were just fine talking to us three and a half days ago! 
 
**Calabasas:** Unfortunately, due to Vlad&#39;s ineptitude, we lost it to some midnight raiders. Specifically a pair of SCP-7799-4 instances. Lancaster and his privates couldn&#39;t shoot for shit, letting them get away. 
 
**Lancaster:** Now what in the hell are you talkin&#39; about?! We saved your life back there! Wasn&#39;t that supposed to be our job? 
 
**Cap:** Yeah! I didn&#39;t just get shot at for no reason! 
  
**Dowser:** Calabasas just thinks he&#39;s better than us! 
 
[Perseus start an argument between them.] 
 
**Bimston:** Enough. We&#39;ll sort out what happened later. Did your body cams capture everything? 
 
**Calabasas:** Yes, actually. But me and Vlad&#39;s were the only ones still working by the end of it, though. Lancaster and his privates&#39; body cams broke halfway through the trip after an unprecedented attack. They still have them though, and we were hoping you could salvage the film in them. 
  
**Pen:** Sure thing, sounds easy enough! 
 
**Bimston:** Do you still have those Range Rovers? 
 
**Calabasas:** Those were both stolen or destroyed. 
 
**Bimston:** Then how did you get here? You drove up to the front gate, no? 
 
**Lancaster:** Let&#39;s just say that while we were in there, we had to borrow a couple of cars. 
 
**Bimston:** Oh.. I see... 
 
**Pen:** We can&#39;t just have those cars sitting in there! It&#39;s all 1980s out there, right? That would be like if alien technology crash-landed on Earth! 
 
**Lancaster:** I wouldn&#39;t worry about it too much, those cars were gas-guzzling pieces of shit. Why&#39;d you make us drive those things anyway? Was it for an advertisement promotion? 
 
**Bimston:** How many drones did you plant out there? All four of them hopefully? 
 
**Vladivostok:** We lost three of four. One of them&#39;s set up in some backwater town called &#34;Czernowitz&#34; and the rest are either stolen or busted. 
   
**Bimston:** Damn it... that&#39;s about 300,00 dollars down the drain... but I&#39;m sure the higher-ups will understand. 
 
**Vladivostok:** What do you mean by &#34;higher-ups&#34;? Aren&#39;t you and Pen the higher-ups around here? 
 
**Bimston:** No need to worry about that right now. We&#39;re glad you&#39;re back. Please, make yourself at home. Your job is almost done. 
 
**Pen:** All you have to do now is act as witnesses to SCP-7799&#39;s nature while we have one last talk with SCP-7799-3. We need you guys because it&#39;s been keen on manipulating us lately. 
 
**Calabasas:** Sounds good enough. It&#39;s an ineffable pleasure to see you two again.  
 
**Bimston:** Likewise for the six of you. You can take those body cams off now. 
  
**Vladivostok:** Thank the Lord, this thing&#39;s been making my neck itch for days now- 
 
[Vladivostok and Calabasas turn off their body cams. Perseus head to the shower wards to clean and properly clothe themselves. Later that night, HQ throws a commemorative &#34;welcome back&#34; party for Perseus as their footage is transcribed and parsed.]

The following is a comprehensible timeline and transcribed footage of events that occurred shortly after Perseus&#39; return to the SCP-7799 Research and Containment Headquarters and before the scheduled interview with SCP-7799-3. Non-English languages have been translated into standard English to the best of various translators&#39; abilities.

[After the party is over and HQ&#39;s janitors clean up the red party cups and deflated balloons that were left behind on the floor, Dr. Bimston and multiple other translators and transcribers are evaluating Perseus&#39; exploration footage in the terminal room while other researchers take notes on notable moments and discoveries found in the footage. Dr. Calabasas walks in and moseys around before approaching Dr. Bimston.] 
 
**Calabasas:** Everything going well so far? 
 
**Bimston:** Other than having to transcribe or cut out hours of arguments and cursing, I think we&#39;re doing well. 
 
**Calabasas:** Splendid. 
 
**Bimston:** Watching all of this, I&#39;m coming to realize what you all went through to get her again. It&#39;s admirable. 
 
**Calabasas:** Why thank you! It&#39;s my pleasure to lead a group of stumbling buffoons to success- 
   
**Bimston:** Another thing I&#39;ve noticed is these moments of intricacies between all of you along the way. Especially between you and Vlad. You two know each other? 
 
**Calabasas:** Yes, unfortunately. We used to be friends back when we were junior researchers in 2017. We&#39;re not friends anymore, though. Why do ask? 
  
**Bimston:** There&#39;s this one moment where Vlad told you he signed up to&#34;impress&#34; you. What did he mean by that? 
 
**Calabasas:** [Sigh] Apparently, he signed up for this exploration because he knew I was going to, and thought of it as an opportunity to &#34;impress&#34; me as you said, and become my friend again apparently. 
 
**Bimston:** Hm. 
 
**Calabasas:** I know, it&#39;s absolutely pathetic. You should have seen his reaction when I told him that I wouldn&#39;t be his friend again, it&#39;s priceless. [Chuckle] 
  
**Bimston:** That&#39;s the thing. You see, I don&#39;t like Vlad personally. He&#39;s a whiney, fragile guy who gives off involuntary celibate energy to me... 
 
**Calabasas:** That&#39;s Gergo in a can. 
 
**Bimston:** ...but what you&#39;ve displayed here in all of your unusual fits of anger and swearing at him makes me think that when the rest of the Foundation sees this, they won&#39;t be too happy about it. 
 
[Calabasas stops smiling.]
 
**Calabasas:** What do you mean? 
 
**Bimston:** I&#39;ve seen a lot of logs where some of the members have witty, sibling-like banter with each other. But what&#39;s going on here seems to be just you insulting and screaming at him and the rest of the group. 
 
**Calabasas:** But he&#39;s an idiot! Why do you care what I tell him? He&#39;s just meant to do as I say and that&#39;s it. 
 
**Bimston:** Just saying, if the Ethics Committee see this, they won&#39;t be happy. 
 
[Calabasas looks around.] 
 
**Calabasas:** You&#39;re right.. I can&#39;t //possibly// have this on my track record if I want a promotion! Is there anyway way to cut it out? 
 
**Bimston:** That would get me and you in trouble.
 
**Calabasas:** Please? 
 
**Bimston:** I said I can&#39;t do that. 
 
**Calabasas:** [Sigh] Fine. When me and Vlad head out to Site-88 later for that interrogation, I&#39;ll... have a talk with him.  
  
**Bimston:** About what? 
 
**Calabasas:** Nothing... nothing... 
 
[Calabasas walks out as Bimston stares at him with suspicion. He resumes his work shortly after.]

[Meanwhile, Dr. Pen sits in his office controlling the singular drone Perseus had planted during the exploration. The drone is deemed useless due to its location, and hours before, researchers had already used it to take notes on SCP-7799 for themselves. Dr. Vladivostok walks into his office.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** Just letting you know that we&#39;re heading out to Site-88 for that integration. 
 
**Pen:** That&#39;s good to hear, Vlad. I hope you have fun meeting that thing, but be careful. It&#39;ll probably lie out of anything you ask it. 
 
**Vladivostok:** Trust me, I can deal with it when it comes to that. I have some choice words for that thing after the shit I went through. 
 
**Pen:** Good to hear. 
 
**Vladivostok:** What are you doing?  
  
**Pen:** This drone has been deemed useless, so I decided to take some last-second notes before we stop using it. I&#39;m going to fly to the capital with it and see if I can see anything interesting. 
 
**Vladivostok:** You do that then. But I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll know what they&#39;re saying.
 
**Pen:** I&#39;ve spent my fair share of time in Germany during overseas work. It&#39;s just Austrian German, right? I should at least get the main idea of what they&#39;re saying, right? 
 
**Vladivostok:** I guess so. Anyway, I apologize for how much of a success and nightmare this all turned out to be. 
 
**Pen:** It&#39;s alright. You came back with good footage, didn&#39;t you? 
 
**Vladivostok:** I guess-
 
**Pen:** Then you did your job. 
 
**Vladivostok:** Thanks then. [He looks at the clock mounted on the wall.] It&#39;s about time I leave for our interrogation. I&#39;ll see you later. 
 
**Pen:** See you, Vlad. 
 
[Vladivostok leaves the room as Pen resumes controlling the drone. He has traveled halfway across the territory and expects to reach the capital in thirty minutes or less. However, he does not appear to notice that this last-minute note-taking session will save lives.]

However, their experiences were documented and will be shown to SCP-7799-3.[[/footnote]] arrive at Site-88 via an escort and enter through the ground level Baldwin County Alabama nuclear power plant to the lower levels that contain Site-88 itself. It is bustling with personnel and armed guards who have become accustomed to their unusual job. An old but familiar voice speaks on the intercom to all personnel after two chimes.] 
  
**Intercom:** Attention to nearest anomalous security personnel: Please escort humanoid SCP object number seven-seven-nine-nine-dash three to anomalous interrogation room number A113 for Doctor Calabasas&#39; Doctor Vladivostok and Seargeant Lancaster&#39;s scheduled interview with the object in question.

**Calabasas:** That&#39;s our queue. A113 is down the hall to the left. 
 
**Vladivostok:** Never been here before. It&#39;s a pretty cozy-looking site. 
 
**Calabasas:** Sure thing, but remember that you&#39;re probably absorbing high levels of radiation into your brain, being on top of a nuclear power plant in all.

**Lancaster:** Just getting a drink. I&#39;m thirsty as hell. Hey, does this place have that one anomaly that makes any drink you want? 
  
**Vladivostok:** That&#39;s Site-19, Phil. We&#39;re in Site-88. 
 
**Lancaster:** Oh, okay. Just asking because I&#39;m still hella tired and would appreciate a coffee. 
 
**Vladivostok:** You&#39;re going to have to wait. We need to get this final part done. 
 
**Lancaster:** &#39;Aight then, will do. 
 
**Vladivostok:*** Where&#39;s the privates? They couldn&#39;t come as &#34;witnesses&#34; either? 
 
**Lancaster:** No. They&#39;re currently being promoted after their &#34;display of valor and professionalism during their time in SCP-7799&#34;. I may not like those maggots, but I&#39;m sure as hell proud of them.
 
**Vladivostok:** That&#39;s good to hear. If you see them again, tell them I said congrats... and thank you for their service.

**Vladivostok:** What&#39;s that thing you wanted to tell me about? 
 
**Calabasas:** What thing... oh, right. That. Let me explain. 
 
**Vladivostok:** Explain what? 
 
**Calabasas:** Bimston back at HQ made me aware of some... issues that may arise if our footage goes public. Public as in, within the Foundation as a whole. 
  
**VladivostoK:** Yeah? What about it? 
 
**Calabasas:** What he said was that... um... well... 
 
**Vladivostok:** What? 
 
**Calabasas:** Er, you know what? Could you do me a favor? 
 
**Vladivostok:** What is it? 
 
**Calabasas:** If anyone asks anything about what I said to you during our exploration, just tell them that we&#39;re friends and you we&#39;re just emotional because of the... unnatural situation at the time. Say that we have friendly competition and banter between us all the time. 
 
**Vladivostok:** I thought I wasn&#39;t your friend. 
 
**Calabasas:** Well, now you are! Sounds great? 
 
**Vladivostok:** I don&#39;t understand what you mean. Besides, I don&#39;t want to be your friend or try to be your friend again. You&#39;re an asshole. 
 
**Calabasas:** Vlad, I- you know this is being recorded, right? 
 
**Vladivostok:** Yeah, so? 
 
**Calabasas:** I&#39;m just... ahem, [He speaks very closely to his body camera&#39;s audio receptor] ...//trying to remind you that I am your friend and that we have friendly competition and banter despite some situations in which we have emotional intricacies in moments of intense peril//-

**Calabasas:** Stop, I&#39;m- nevermind. We&#39;ll talk about this after we&#39;re done. 
 
[The three of them enter the interrogation room and await SCP-7799-3&#39;s arrival. They wait patiently as Calabasas has a wave of anxiety wash over him due to his conversation with Dr. Bimston earlier.]

[Meanhwile, Dr. Pen has finally made the drone reach Vienna, where he spectates civilians and SCP-7799-2 instances going about their daily jobs and activities as the Schönbrunn Palace comes into view again. Multi-colored lights go off through the windows with muffle music playing, implying some form of a party is occurring.] 
 
**Pen:** I wonder if I can sneak this thing in... 
 
[Pen lowers the drone to look for any open areas. He flies over to the grand backyard of the palace where an SCP-7799-2 instance can be seen exiting a back door to take out a bag of trash. Pen uses this opportunity to sneak the drone into the palace without it noticing, and successfully does so.]  
  
[Inside consist of a grand party between the upper class and the elite from all parts of SCP-7799. Music is blasting as guest dance or converse with each other while dining on the best food available.] 
 
**Pen:** What the...
 
[Suddenly, SCP-7799-1 reveals itself on the top of a balcony, holding a glass of wine. Everyone in the vicinity stops talking or dancing to look up at it.]
  
**SCP-7799-1:** [Austrian German] Ladies and Gentleman, I am proud to hold this party in my humble abode and especially proud to hold it with nobody else but you. 
 
[The guests cheer.] 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** One last time, I want to reassure you that your societal positions will not in any way be altered by this &#34;X-Insurgency&#34;, that has been almost eradicated successfully! Your wealth and belongings will not be lost to them. We&#39;re not communists, after all... 
 
[The guest murmur amongst each other until SCP-7799-1 begins to speak again.] 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** So I ask you all as a man of God to not worry about such irrelevant issues while I, your Kaiser, solve them for you.
 
[The crowd cheers and the party resumes. SCP-7799-2 instances shoot T-Shit cannons at party guests, who are willing to catch them. SCP-7799-1 finishes its glass of wine and hands it to an SCP-7799-2 instance to dispose of it. It exits out of view into a room off-limits to the party-goers.] 
  
[In response, Pen moves the drone up the flight of stairs and flies it into this room as another SCP-7799-2 instance opens the door to enter. Inside is a small personal office for SCP-7799-1, who sits at a paper-stacked desk, rubbing its eyeball head.]
  
**SCP-7799-1:** Mother of Mary, my eye doesn&#39;t feel so tubular right now. Could somebody give me my eye drops?

**SCP-7799-1:** Oh, it&#39;s time already? Well, that&#39;s awesome to hear, but let me make a phone call first. Wait right here. 
   
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{Yes, my lord.}} 
 
[SCP-7799-1 stands up and grabs a brick cell phone on the other side of the room. It returns to its desk to sit down and looks at its personal phone number list. Dr. Pen zooms in to see the contents of the list. The following has been roughly translated and censored accordingly.]

[[/div]]
  
[SCP-7799-1 appears to select the bottom number and dials it on the brick cell phone. He waits patiently for a moment before speaking again.]
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Yo, DC! Everything&#39;s going well in the crib out here, ya dig? 
 
[Silence.] 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Radical. 
 
[Silence.]
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Well, I&#39;m glad to have been given such a wicked opportunity from the Director herself! 
 
[Silence.] 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Good to hear. I know I&#39;ve asked this before, but your logo is quite evocative of Satanism... or Judaism. Your sure that you&#39;re not associated with those things at all? 
 
[Silence.]
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Okay, good. 
 
[Silence.]
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Trust me ma&#39;am, our righteous endeavor tonight will be one to totally remember! 
  
[Silence. SCP-7799-1&#39;s leisurely posture stops.]
  
**SCP-7799-1:** Oh uh... what did you say? [Silence.] Modern military? Why, our military is as modern as modern can be! Nothing but the most gnarly and advanced technology the world has to offer! Think Star Wars! 
 
[Silence.]
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Trust me, after tonight, you&#39;ll wish you had aligned yourself with me sooner. Get ready for your minds to be blown!
 
[Silence.] 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** [Chuckle] Yeah, fer sure. I&#39;ll see ya after our operation has been completed. Have a goodnight. Don&#39;t let the bed bugs bite. 
 
[It hangs up and looks around the room. According to its body language, it appears nervous.]
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{Is everything alright, my lord?}} 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** [Sigh] Nothing.. nothing at all. Hand me a drink, will you? Sit down. 
 
[The SCP-7799-2 instance commander grabs a drink from a nearby cooler and takes a seat with SCP-7799-1 and hands it the drink.] 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Everything&#39;s going according to plan tonight, nothing&#39;s wrong... it&#39;s just that... er... I&#39;m so exhausted from these pesky rebels who are trying to overthrow me. Every day I send out missile strikes and armored platoons to no avail! Some of my men are even on those smiley-faced bastards&#39; payroll! Damn this X-Insurgency! 
  
[It sighs as it takes a long drink from its soda can. It places the can next to the book it is currently reading, Niccolo Machiavelli&#39;s &#34;The Prince&#34;.]
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{I believe you once told me that you do not care for them at all.}} 
 
**SCP-7799:** I- what? I-I never said such a thing, y-you&#39;re mistaken... 
 
 **7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{I apologize for my assumption. Forgive me.}} 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** I forgive you, commander. 
 
[It takes another drink of its soda.] 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** [Sigh] Those who have willingly allowed themselves to be manipulated by the X-Insurgency will surely pay for their actions soon.
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:**  {{Not to mention the guilt they must carry knowing they have gone against the orders of their glorious, all-knowing, righteous Kaiser.}} 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** True words, commander. 
 
[It takes another drink of its soda.]
 
**SCP-7799-1:** But at the end of the day, I don&#39;t necessarily care too much about it. It doesn&#39;t matter to me. If a civilian or soldier of mine dies, I feel nothing about it. Even if I would personally prefer these insurgents didn&#39;t exist like ants crawling on my body making me //itch//... and maybe if my dear friend had joined me in this almost-duel monarchy I have established... I still have the Hungarian crown for him... 
 
[SCP-7799-1 appears to trail off and think solemnly to itself.] 
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{It is true, for we are vessels of your creation to carry out your orders.}}
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Oh! Er- yes, correct. You know //why// that is, right?
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{No, but I am not programmed to question why.}}
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Good answer, but I guess I&#39;ll tell you anyway. [It stands up and heads to another door] Follow me. 
 
[The instance commander follows SCP-7799-1 through another door as Pen flies the drone into the room they entered, which appears to be a long, extravagant hallway filled with portraits of SCP-7799-1. As the two walk down the hall, Pen also moves the drone to record their conversation.]
 
**SCP-7799-1:** All of //this// is familiar and comfortable to me. This whole nation is familiar and comfortable to me. I love it with all my heart just as much as I love Christ our Lord. After all, this decade was my childhood.
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{Yes.}} 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** But the //outside// world beyond our borders confuses me. The people who live in it are equally as confusing. At one point in time, when I was a little boy, everybody knew God and abided by him. He was a societal axiom.  
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{Very true.}} 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Now, everyone has forsaken him, and run off to become Sodomites and slanderers to hunt down believers like me. They&#39;ve overthrown their parents and run off to worship the golden calf and the Whore of Babylon like they were always societal axioms of some kind despite abandoning God just decades ago. 
  
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{A strange phenomenon.}} 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** It is the work of the devil, my friend. His hold on our worldly society is stronger than ever before. He&#39;s warped the minds of everyone out there to engage in Sodomy of all kinds. Caucasoids, Negroids, and Mongoloids have all fallen to his feet, drinking the wine of foolishness. All except for me, who hides in this paradise thanks to my radical invention, away from Babylonia that waits outside of our borders. 
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{You are a good man, my lord.}} 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Indeed I am, commander. But know that keyword- &#34;me&#34;. You see, I made this place for myself, not the people you see out there or any of you either. You&#39;re all worthless compared to the value that I am worth, and the infinite wisdom and knowledge I hold regarding tactics, cunningness, and history as a whole. This place was meant to be for myself and myself only. This decade is real, true, and good in all ways. The outside world is too... feminist for my taste. Everyone out there has forgotten the traditional family values we should have never let go of in the first place and would prefer to worship fools than leaders and God; This paradise is for me, no one else. 
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{This paradise is for you and you alone, my lord. Our purpose is to serve you.}} 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Yes, commander. Now you understand. 
 
[They pass by a rusty, metal door that appears to be greatly out of place in comparison to the hallway. A warning sign above it translates to: &#34;ATTENTION: DO NOT ENTER UNLESS CARRYING AUTHORIZED CLEARANCE.&#34; Pen&#39;s drone barely picks up the sound of banging and grinding metal coming from behind it.]
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Oh, It&#39;s always cool to walk by this door. This rad door... this awesome invention that made all of this possible... 
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{What must we do now?}} 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Oh, sorry. Let&#39;s keep going. I just... happen to like this door, and my awesome invention, too. 
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{I do as well.}} 
 
[Finally, they reach SCP-7799-1&#39;s bedroom. It is designed in the way a child during the 1980s would have enjoyed, with the exception of copious surveillance TVs in the corner of the room. Each of these TVs display a random SCP-7799-2 instance&#39;s first-person perspective before cutting to another one&#39;s and so on.] 
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{Is there a reason you have come here, my lord?}} 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** And that&#39;s why- wait, why //did// we come here again? Ah, yes. I remember now. Wait here a moment, commander. I must grab my Reebok Pumps. It&#39;s a special occasion tonight, so I think it would be real swagger to do so. 
   
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{Most definitely, my lord.}} 
   
[SCP-7799-1 approaches its racecar bed and takes off its current shoes to wear the Reebok Pumps. He pumps them up before skipping back to the doorway while taking a quick glance at the surveillance TVs.] 
  
**SCP-7799-1:** Tell the army to mobilize, and don&#39;t let them forget about those tunnels, either. Those Nerds that amass at our border won&#39;t know what hit &#39;em. 
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{Understood. We are already aware the power plant&#39;s location where Administrator X is being held. He will be yours soon, my lord.}} 
 
[Upon hearing and understanding the words &#34;Tell; army to mobilize&#34; - &#34;Won&#39;t know what hit &#39;em&#34;, &#34;he will be yours soon my lord&#34;, along with &#34;Administrator X&#34;,  despite being spoken in High German, Pen puts the pieces together and is greatly appalled. He immediately grabs a nearby notebook and pencil to write down everything he could extract from the conversation to tell Dr. Bimston at once.] 
  
**Pen:** Oh no... no no no no... this- this can&#39;t be... I- is this real life? 
 
[He looks back at the drone&#39;s camera feed.]
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Now, it is time for me to man the control station and overlook the operation. My old friend Administrator X will finally be my prisoner. Totally radical. 
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{The operation will go underway, my lord.}} 
 
[The instance commander leaves the room as SCP-7799-1 follows suit via moon-walking and closing the door, trapping Pen&#39;s drone in the room.] 
  
**Pen:** Damn it! No! I-I gotta tell everybody about this! 
 
[Pen jumps from his seat holding his notebook and jogs to Dr. Bimston at once.] 
   
**???:** Hey Pen, what&#39;s the hurry? 
 
[Pen ignores his colleague and continues to sprint into Dr. Bimston&#39;s office, where he is currently attending a meeting between different Foundation officials. They all look at him as he burst through the door panting.]
 
**Bimston:** Pen, what the hell are you doing? I told you that we were having a meeting!
 
**Pen:** Emergency! E-Emergency! You //need// to see this. [He holds up the notebook with notes scribbled on it like a madman&#39;s journal. Bimston takes the notebook and looks at the notes.] 
 
**Bimston:** What is this supposed to tell me? 
 
**Pen:** I was watching SCP-7799-1! I-I snuck a drone into its hideout! I understand German a little bit- well, enough to know that it&#39;s starting something tonight! Something real bad! 
 
**Bimston:** Calm down! SCP-7799-1 said what? 
 
 **Pen:** Did you hear me?! It&#39;s going to attack us! Look at my quotes! I&#39;ll show you the recording if I have to! 
 
**Bimston** P-Pen, please... I don&#39;t need to deal with another one of your panic attacks. This is quite frankly very embarrassing for both of us. 
 
**Pen:** But look- 
 
**Bimston:** Please, tell Dr. Heisenburg or something about your theory... please. 
 
**Pen:** But it&#39;s... okay... okay... I apologize for my outburst. 
 
**Bimston:** Good, you may leave. 
 
[Pen sulkily leaves as Bimston lets out an audible sigh. Pen begins to make himself think that it was all a misunderstanding in the first place due to his amateur German. The subject is not brought up again for a time.]

[Meanwhile, Dr. Calabasas, Dr. Vladivostok, and Lancaster continue to wait on SCP-7799-3. The delay has taken significantly much longer than expected.] 
  
**Lancaster:** The hell&#39;s takin&#39; so damn long?
 
**Calabasas:** It seems like we&#39;ll have to do this tomorrow. 
 
**Vladivostok:** It shouldn&#39;t take them this long to get one humanoid object out of containment. This place&#39;s fucking stupid. 
 
**Calabasas:** Pipe down. There&#39;s probably hundreds of experiments and research projects going on right now, so it&#39;ll probably take a while to- 
  
**Vladivostok:** All the Foundation&#39;s been doing this whole time is be incompetent. They sent us on that shitty exploration and now they make us sit here and wait? Fuck them, we&#39;re leaving now. 
 
[Just as Vladivostok gets up from his chair, a group of armed guards bring SCP-7799-3 into the interrogation room. It is outfitted in a spare D-Class jumpsuit hastily put onto it and cuffed. Its yellow, enigmatic smiley-faced head has not changed slightly and stares at the three with unknown intent. Whether it is full of vitality or nothing at all, is unknown to the three.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Oh, you&#39;re here... [He sits back down.] 
   
**Guard:** Couldn&#39;t find anything that fits on this freak except one of the D-Class jumpsuits. 
 
**Calabasas:** That&#39;s fine, just sit it here. 
 
[The guards bring SCP-7799-3 to its designated seat as Calabasas sets up the TV screen behind them opposite to SCP-7799-3&#39;s position at the table. Calabasas then puts a folder on the table and pulls out sheets of statistics and photos from Operation: Perseus as well as attempting to set up the TV to show it body camera footage from the exploration itself. SCP-7799-3 surveys the room around him, looking at everything for what it is to their respective extent, documenting them. The guards leave and wait outside.]
 
**Calabasas:** Alright, everything&#39;s almost ready... 
 
**Vladivostok:** So, you&#39;re the leader of the X-Insurgency? 
 
[SCP-7799-3 is silent and does not look at him.] 
 
**Calabasas:** Don&#39;t engage in conversation with it, Vlad. 
 
**Vladivostok:** My bad. 
 
**Lancaster:** How the hell did you get that thingamajig on your head? 
 
[SCP-7799-3 is preoccupied with examining the room to the point where its meaning as a concept is gone. Vladivostok and Lancaster stand behind them with their hands folded like nameless goons standing behind a villain in a movie of some sort. Perhaps this is subconsciously done in an attempt to intimidate SCP-7799-3.] 
  
**Calabasas:** Alright, let&#39;s get this started. How should I go about it, though? Hmm... 
 
**Lancaster:** Just do it, man. 
 
**Calabasas:** Here&#39;s an idea, how about I do the classic Foundation and humanoid object-interrogation flow? It never fails. 
 
[Calabasas pulls out his sheet of pre-planned questions and clears his throat upon sitting down.] 
 
**Calabasas:** Good afternoon, SCP-7799-3. My name is Doctor Roger Calabasas, but you can call me Calabasas for today. I&#39;m going to be asking you some questions that expect logical replies to them, understood? 
 
[SCP-7799-3 is silent.] 
 
**Calabasas:** Understood? 
 
[SCP-7799-3 continues to ignore him.] 
 
**Calabasas:** Undertsood?! [His tone comes off much more intense than he anticipated.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Your identification card is crooked. 
 
**Calabasas:** Huh? Oh. 
 
[Calabasas realizes his ID card hanging off of his lab coat is in fact, crooked. He adjusts it quickly.] 
  
**Calabasas:** Thank you, SCP-7799-3. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Well dressed today, I see? Looks expensive.
 
**Calabasas:** Thank you again. It&#39;s nothing, just something I threw on today. [Chuckle]
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Your ID says level four on it. How many doors can it open around here? 
 
**Calabasas:** This? Oh, it&#39;ll open nearly every door in this place. Only someone like myself would have such a privilege-where was I? Ah, yes. My first question here asks about- 
 
[The Site intercom beeps twice, signifying a message to the Site&#39;s personnel. Calabasas groans as the familiar voice speaks.] 
  
**Intercom:** Attention to all personnel, there have been reports of unauthorized vehicles located near the Baldwin County nuclear power plant&#39;s front gate. Do not let this announcement deter you from your duties. Thank you. [Sign off noise.]
    
**Calabasas:** Seriously? That was it? [Sigh] Okay, where were we? 
 
**Lancaster:** First question.
 
**Calabasas:** Alright, first question. SCP-7799-3, where did you come from? 
 
[SCP-7799-3 is silent.]
 
**Calabasas:** Don&#39;t start this again. Talk to me or-  
 
[The intercom beeps again.]
 
**Calabasas:** What hell is it now? 
 
**Vladivostok:** Shh. 
 
[The intercom&#39;s voice does not speak for three seconds.]
   
**Intercom:** Attention to all personnel, multiple armed belligerents have entered Site-88&#39;s ground-level power plant facility. This is not a drill. We urge all personnel to remain calm and resume their duties as non-Foundation affiliated police forces deal with the threat at hand. I repeat, we urge all personnel to remain calm-
 
[Suddenly, everything around the three lightly rumbles. Alarms can be barely heard in the ground below them. It appears that the intercom speaker noticed this as well, forcing them to remain silent.]
 
**Intercom:** I repeat... we urge all personnel to... we urge... 
 
[The voice goes silent again before signing off. The three are confused.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** What the hell is going on? 
 
**Calabasas:** I don&#39;t know, but- 
 
**Lancaster:** Why&#39;d they stop talkin&#39;? 
 
**Calabasas:** That doesn&#39;t matter, we&#39;re doing an interrogation right now, Phil and-
 
[The lights flicker as the rumbling gets louder.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** I-It&#39;s an earthquake! 
 
**Calabasas:** I... don&#39;t think- is it? 
  
[Then, the ground beneath them shakes violently on queue with all sirens in the Site blaring simultaneously.] 
 
**Lancaster:** Fuckin&#39; hell! 
 
**Vladivostok:** Get down! 
 
[The shaking immediately stops as the lights around them deactivate, leaving them in the dark as sirens continue to blare with less vitality than they had before.]
 
**Vladivostok:** Fuck! 
 
**Lancaster:** I can&#39;t see jackshit! 
 
**Calabasas:** What the hell just happened?! 
 
[The three curse and flail their hands around for some kind of light source to no avail. SCP-7799-3 continues to sit in its chair handcuffed with its head acting as the brightest color in the dark. It looks around intrigued at the recent events unfolding. Outside of the room, a commotion of screaming and gunfire can be heard.]
 
**Lancaster:** It sounds like pandemonium out there! 
 
**Vladivostok:** What is going on?! 
 
[The intercom comes back, this time with a different voice.]
 
**Intercom:** The Site is experiencing multiple Keter and Euclid-level containment breaches. Full site lockdown initiated.  
 
**Vladivostok:** W-what does that mean?! We need to get out of here! 
 
**Lancaster:** No, wait! The best place to stay during a breach is where you&#39;re at! We&#39;ll be saved eventually! 
 
**Vladivostok:** Fuck that shit! If they couldn&#39;t save us from SCP-7799, then they won&#39;t save us here! 
  
[Vladivostok opens the interrogation room&#39;s door, allowing a plethora of screams, gunshots, and anomalous sounds to seep in. A guard runs past the door and drops dead due to oncoming gunfire. Vladivostok immediately closes the door again.]
  
**Vladivostok:** Shit! 
 
[Lancaster runs up to the door before locking it and stepping away.]
 
**Calabasas:** There&#39;s no way out! We&#39;re fucked! It&#39;s the last straw! 
 
**Lancaster:** Don&#39;t say that! If we got out of SCP-7799, then we&#39;ll get out of this- 
 
**Calabasas:** You don&#39;t understand anything you idiot! 
 
**Vladivostok:** Stop arguing, please! Does anybody have a flashlight? A phone or something? We can&#39;t just stand here in the dark.
 
**Lancaster:** My phone&#39;s dead! 
  
**Calabasas:** I-I think mine&#39;s still alive, but I need to turn it back on. What about you? 
 
**Vladivostok:** It&#39;s at fifteen percent, but I&#39;ll turn my flashlight on too. 
 
[Vladivostok and Calabasas turn on their phone flashlights and illuminate the room.]
     
**Calabasas:** Now what? This doesn&#39;t stop the fact that we&#39;re dead! 
 
**Vladivostok:** At least we have some light. I&#39;d prefer that than be in the pitch dark. 
 
**Calabasas:** I-I can&#39;t believe this is happening... I- this is //your// fault, Vlad! 
 
**Vladivostok:** What did I do?! 
 
**Calabasas:** You-you... well... er- you did this! 
 
**Vladivostok:** Don&#39;t start this! Not right now! 
  
**Lancaster:** Could y&#39;all stop arguin&#39; for once?! For one moment?! 
 
**Calabasas:** I-I... he- but he&#39;s- 
  
**Vladivostok:** Stop pushing everything onto me to make you feel better! 
 
**Calabasas:** Say that again and you&#39;ll be sorry. 
 
**Lancaster:** Listen! We&#39;re trapped in some dinky room with an anomalous object! We should focus on that! [He points to SCP-7799-3, which is currently pacing around the room.]    
 
**Calabasas:** Right... let&#39;s deal with that first.
 
[Variuos sound of chaos can be heard all around them, muffled.]
 
**Lancaster:** Is there any way you can get that thing to stay still? We can&#39;t just have it walkin&#39; around willy-nilly! 
 
**Vladivostok:** Let me try and get it back real fast. 
 
[Vladivostok approaches SCP-7799-3 with caution, attempting to grab its shoulder to face it toward him.]
  
**Vladivostok:** SCP-7799-3, don&#39;t move. We&#39;re just trying to stay safe during a time of- 
 
[Before Vladivostok can lay his hand on SCP-7799-3&#39;s shoulder, it drives its hand into the corner of the privacy wall, splitting the handcuffs and freeing its hands. Vladivostok backs up as Calabasas&#39; and Lancaster&#39;s eyes widen.] 
 
**Vladivostok:**  Hey! Hey... hey... put your hands behind your back.. and keep them there until we get rescued, got it? 
  
[SCP-7799-3 stares at Vladivostok silently.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** I said, put your hand behind your back, now. 
 
[SCP-7799-3 looks at him for a moment longer before walking to the interrogation room&#39;s door.]
 
**Calabasas:** What are you doing?! SCP-7799-3, answer me! 
 
[SCP-7799-3 unlocks the door.] 
 
**Calabasas:** Hey, stop that! 
 
[It walks out and closes the door behind it. The three look at each other for a moment.] 
 
**Calabasas:* Don&#39;t just stand there you two, get it! 
 
**Vladivostok:** I&#39;m not going out there! 
  
**Lancaster:** It&#39;s safer to stay in here! 
 
**Calabasas:** If nobody will get it, I will. 
 
**Lancaster:** Cal! Stop! 
 
[Calabasas leaves the room to the outside, where sounds of chaos have toned down greatly with the exception of occasional gunfire. Vladivostok and Lancaster follow him into the dark hallway outside of the room. Fluorescent lights flicker dimly above them as Calabasas jogs down the hall, then stops. He jogs the other way, then stops again.] 
 
**Calabasas:** Damn it, we lost it! It&#39;s your fault! [He points to Vlad.]
 
**Vladivostok:** How was it me?! 
 
**Calabasas:** You didn&#39;t stop it when it //walked// out right in front of you! 
 
**Vladivostok:** I-I froze up man! He looks creepy! 
 
**Calabasas:** You fucking bastard! Now we&#39;ll be ruined because of you! //I&#39;ll// be ruined because of you!- 
  
[A gun cocks behind Calabasas. Vladivostok and Lancaster freeze as SCP-7799-3 reveals itself from the shadows of the hallway behind Calabasas. It holds a weapon stolen off the corpse of a guard.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Don&#39;t move. 
 
[The three put their hands up.] 
 
**Lancaster:** Shit! We surrender! We surrender! 
 
**Calabasas:** Don&#39;t shoot! Please! 
 
**Vladivostok:** Cal, stop moving!-
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Enough. All of you, come here. 
 
[The three approach SCP-7799-3 with their hands up.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Turn around.
 
[They turn around, expecting to be shot.] 
 
**Calabasas:** Please! Oh God! No! 
  
**SCP-7799-3:** Wherever I tell you to go, you go. Understood? 
  
**Calabasas:** Huh? W-why? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** You are my human shields. 
 
[The three are shocked at SCP-7799-3&#39;s matter-of-fact tone and confession.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** If any of you try to run away, I&#39;ll shoot all of you. 
 
**Vladivostok:** Why are you doing this?... 
 
[SCP-7799-3 looks at Vladivostok.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Why? 
 
[Vladivostok is silent. SCP-7799-3 looks behind itself and back at the three.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** You, bring your level four clearance identification card out. 
 
[Calabasas as if by instinct, takes his card and holds it out in front of him, to no one.] 
  
**SCP-7799-3:** Whatever door I want to go through, you will open. 
 
**Calabasas:** Yes, yes- anything. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Go. All of you. 
  
[The three walk in conjunction with SCP-7799-3 as he holds them hostage. They look around corners and in rooms for it including opening locked doors via Calabasas&#39; card so it may continue forward.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Where is the exit? Preferably a backdoor out. 
 
**Calabasas:** There is no &#34;backdoor&#34;- 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Tell me where it is. [It cocks its weapon again.] 
  
**Calabasas:** I-I told you! There&#39;s no backdoor! There isn&#39;t! I&#39;m telling the truth. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Five... four... 
 
**Calabasas:** Please! Don&#39;t hurt me! 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** ...three... two.. one- 
  
**Calabasas:** There&#39;s a garage! A big garage! 
 
[SCP-7799-3 stops and relaxes its trigger finger.]
   
**Calabasas:** Yeah! Yeah! There&#39;s a big garage somewhere around here, It&#39;ll lead you to ground level! That&#39;s what you want, right?! 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Yes. Take me there. 
 
**Calabasas:** I don&#39;t know where it is! 
  
**SCP-7799-3:** Don&#39;t lie to me. 
 
**Calabasas:** I&#39;m telling the truth! I swear on my fucking life! 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Let&#39;s find it together, then. Come on. 
  
[The four move from room to room, looking for a map or the garage itself randomly. The intercom comes back on, piquing the interest of SCP-7799-3 as it orders the three to stop.] 
  
**Intercom:** Mobile Task Force Unit Epsilon-11, designated Nine-Tailed Fox, has entered the facility. Personnel will be escorted out upon the containment of all escaped SCP objects. Please remain in the evacuation shelter or any other safe area in the meantime. [Sign off noise.] 
  
**SCP-7799-3:** Hm. Keep moving. 
 
[The four of them reach two large doors with a sign marked &#34;Storage&#34;.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Is this storage room useful to me? 
 
**Calabasas:** This seem&#39;s like it&#39;ll lead to the garage. I mean, if people are moving storage out of the site, then it&#39;s gotta lead to the garage, right?- 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Open it, now. 
 
**Calabasas:** I-I am! It doesn&#39;t need a card...
  
[As Calabasas slowly pushes the door open, voices can be heard down the hall. SCP-7799-3 turns its head in the general direction of the sounds.] 
 
[The sounds get louder and more audible.]
 
**???:** [Croatian] The Englishmen have weapons I&#39;ve only seen in Star Wars! 
 
**???:** [Croatian] We have to get out of here! I&#39;m running for my life! 
 
[As the two figures get closer, as if by instinct, SCP-7799-3 opens fire into the dark, illuminating parts of it with the muzzle flash. Vladivostok shines his phone&#39;s flashlight at the figures, which are revealed to be SCP-7799-2 instances.]
 
**Lancaster:** It&#39;s those camera freaks that chased us half cross country! 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Move, now. 
 
[The four of them are ushered into the storage room by SCP-7799-3, who takes a look around.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Shine your mobile device&#39;s flashlight mode in that vicinity for me. 
 
**Vladivostok:** What? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Shine the flashlight over there! 
  
**Vladivostok:** Okay! 
 
[Then, Vladivostok&#39;s phone powers down due to low battery.] 
  
**Vladivostok:** It died... please don&#39;t kill me. 
 
[SCP-7799-3 looks at Vladivostok, then at Calabasas.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Is your mobile device still charged? 
 
**Calabasas:** Yes! Yes! I&#39;ll light the way for you in any direction you want me to look at! I&#39;ll do //anything// for you! Anything! 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Just shine the way to the garage. 
 
**Calabasas:** Sir yes sir! I think its that way- 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Then go. 
 
[The four navigate through towers of boxes and files that have sat in their respective spots for decades. They reach another room titled &#34;Unloading Bay&#34;.] 
 
**Calabasas:** I think this is it. This&#39;ll lead you outside. 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Don&#39;t stop. Even when we reach the ground, don&#39;t stop standing in front of me. As a matter of fact, you! Man with the beard! 
   
[Vladivostok turns around.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** W-who? Me? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Yes, you. Stand behind me and shield me. If you run away, I&#39;ll shoot you and your comrades here.
  
**Vladivostok:** O-okay... 
 
[Vladivostok nervously stands behind SCP-7799-3 as Calabasas unlocks the door via his card. They enter and see a large garage filled with loading trucks. One of the main garage doors is halfway open, allowing the sounds of chaos and gunfire to seep in once again.] 
  
**Lancaster:** It sounds like hell out there! 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Do any of these vehicles work? 
 
**Calabasas:** I think you need the car keys for them- 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Do you have the keys? 
 
**Calabasas:** These aren&#39;t my cars. 
 
[SCP-7799-3 grumbles and looks around the room. It appears to find nothing, and cocks its weapon again.] 
   
**SCP-7799-3:** If it must be this way, then we will go outside on foot. Follow me in your assigned positions. 
 
[Without hesitation, the three follow it and surround it into the outside power plant, where a scene of chaos unfolds.] 
 
[Tactical Response Officers are in several squadrons around the power plant attempting to take out the SCP-7799-2 instances, who fight back with military-grade weapons. Soviet-made attack choppers and Mikoyen jets circle the power plant, shooting at Response Officers or plummeting to their death into the power plant&#39;s parking lot. The sounds of war override the sirens wailing over pits of fire and bloodied corpses of Response Officers and SCP-7799-2 instances. Both sides so far appear to be weakened by each other equally.]
  
[SCP-7799-3 and its three hostages crouch-walk next to a tall fence, slowly but surely making their way through the power plant&#39;s premises.]

**Written Report** 
 
Site-88 has been raided by a large group of disorganized but related SCP-7799-2 instances, orchestrated by SCP-7799-1, proving Pen&#39;s observation to be true. HQ is currently in dismay, debating amongst each other how the incident came to be despite limited but stationed security forces outside of SCP-7799 and arguing that security should have noticed this obvious mobilization. 
 
Meanwhile, nearby locals who live in close proximity to Site-88 have been evacuated, and impending news coverage of the event is planned to be overridden with intentionally false information to create a cover story.

[Bimston and the rest of Site-88 are currently debating who is at fault for the incident at hand. The theory of underground tunnels being used is brought up only once, and forgotten.] 
 
[Meanwhile, Pen continues to control the drone, hitting it against SCP-7799-1&#39;s bedroom door in a hopeless attempt to get it out.] 
 
**Pen:** C&#39;mon, c&#39;mon... somebody&#39;s got to hear this, right? 
 
[Then, an SCP-7799-2 instance with janitorial supplies enters the room, cleaning SCP-7799-1&#39;s various messes. Pen uses this opportunity to get the drone out of the room and continue to fly down the hallway.] 
 
**Pen:**  I did it! I did it! 
  
[In the following half hour, Pen aimlessly controls the drone, recording the palace&#39;s interior and entering accessible rooms. Pen moves the drone past the staircase before stopping to look at an area of interest behind said staircase. A small, dumbwaiter-like entrance can be seen living up two SCP-7799-2 instances in the room. Pen moves the drone into the dumbwaiter-like mechanism to see what is underneath the palace.] 
   
[Another unexpected sight can be seen. Two hallways branch off into different rooms as various SCP-7799-2 instances walk by either to one of the hallways or the dumbwaiter mechanism. Pen takes the second hallway and enters a large, black control room that bears an uncanny resemblance to the fictitious Death Star control room from different Star Wars movies. Given SCP-7799&#39;s nature, this design choice is assumably intentional.] 
  
[Multiple SCP-77992 instances are seated in the control room, observing different points of view of the SCP-7799-2 instances currently attacking Site-88. SCP-7799-1 is nearby, currently enacting an 80s workout with a pair of oversized headphones.] 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Ooh! Ooh! Hah! Aha! I feel the burn! 
 
[An SCP-7799-2 commander approaches it.] 
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** [Austrian German] {{My lord... there&#39;s a problem that we need to have you be aware of...}} 
 
[SCP-7799-1 takes off its headphones.]
 
**SCP-7799-1:** [Austrian German] Ha! I feel //good// after that! What&#39;s the problem, lad? 
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{It&#39;s... how do I put it? Well, our forces at the English power plant are... dwindling. We&#39;ve lost half of our forces, and the rest are pinned down now that we&#39;ve lost much of our air superiority.}}
 
**SCP-7799-1:** What?! How&#39;s that possible?! 
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{Our forces have reportedly described the Englishmen to have weapons comparable to... Star Wars.}} 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Star Wars?! How is this possible? We have only the most advanced technology on the market! 
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{I&#39;m not so sure myself, my lord... but we&#39;re currently working to resolve the issue-}} 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** You better, or there&#39;ll be demotions for all of you! 
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{U-understood, my lord...}} 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** How do you even flounder in an attack like this one? You did everything like we rehearsed, correct? 
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{Yes, we took the tunnels to leave. After that, we reached the power plant and knocked out their power before ensuing our attack on the premises and everything below it.}} 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Then the issue must be your ineptitude, commander. 
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{I-I promise that I have been doing my best-}} 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Then //do// it! 
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{Y-yes, my lord.}} 
 
[The instance commander sulkily walks away.]
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Hmph! Guard, bring my Nintendo Entertainment System in here! I&#39;m getting bored! 
 
**SCP-7799-2 Instance:** Affirmative. 
 
[SCP-7799-1 twiddles its thumbs nervously, and quickly grabs another brick cellphone and dials a number on it.] 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** DC! Hello again... er... listen, anything you might hear about casualty numbers at that site, it&#39;s incorrect, okay?- Why yes, I&#39;m currently attacking it... it&#39;s a radical invasion for sure.
 
[Silence.] 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** You&#39;ll wish you had me by your side sooner, miss. Trust me. Er, goodbye now... 
 
[It hangs up and clutches the brick cell phone close to its chest and looks around.] 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Nononononono... not now... not now... We&#39;re gonna //win// this thing... win it! Win it! I am Kaiser Valentine Constantine! Nobody defeats me! N-no one! 
 
[Pen is confused at what he has observed.] 
 
**Pen:** What the hell is up with this thing? 
 
[Pen keeps the drone in the corner of the room to observe any future conversations.]

[Chaos continues to spiral out of control in Site-88 as SCP-7799-2 instances and Tactical Response Officers unleash barrages of ammo and explosives at each other, covering the asphalt battleground in craters, bullet shells, discarded gun magazines, corpses of fallen comrades, and blood as fire burns metal and concrete. Decorative trees in the parking lot burn likewise when hours ago they were in good condition.] 
  
[SCP-7799-3 and its new human shields slowly make their way across the warzone, which feels longer and wider than it really is. SCP-7799-3 during the journey takes shots at tactical response officers or SCP-7799-2 instances for seemingly no reason. Whether it is for personal enjoyment or out of instinct is unknown.]
  
[The four of them come across the corpse of an SCP-7799-2 instance. Blood and hanging wires protrude out of its neck as its arms and legs are sprawled out on the ground. SCP-7799-3 evaluates the body before taking its weapon and spare ammo.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** He knows I&#39;m here. Probably why they&#39;re here in the first place. He&#39;s not taking me alive if that&#39;s the case. 
 
**Vladivostok:** W-what do you mean by that? 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Shields don&#39;t talk.  
 
[The four of them continue the journey. Calabasas physically shivers and frantically looks around. He has now become what he thought everyone was around him: a goon.] 
 
[Then, the sounds of war pick up again, louder than before. Rowdy hollering and shouting can be heard. SCP-7799-3 stops, as if surprised, and looks at the source of the commotion.] 
  
[Copius amounts of SCP-7799-4 instances have arrived on civilian trucks and stolen attack helicopters, attacking both parties of the battle and inserting them into the conflict. Some SCP-7799-4 instances fire their weapons at the power plant itself, shouting and cheering.]
 
**Lancaster:** What in tarnation are those fuckers doing here?! 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** My men.. they&#39;ve come for me. I must reach them. 
 
**Calabasas:** We can&#39;t just leave the sidelines! We&#39;ll be shot in an instant- 
  
**SCP-7799-3:** You&#39;ll be shot instantly if you continue that blabbering. 
 
**Calabasas:** You&#39;re right... you&#39;re right... I-I apologize...
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Enough. Keep your shield duties going as I reach that gate. I you run away, you&#39;re going to get shot... by me. Understand? 
 
[The three of them nod like children.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Then follow me. Three.. two... one... 
 
[SCP-7799-3 speed walks to the SCP-7799-4 instances fighting near the front gate in an attempt to escape and finally be free. The Doctors and Seargent stand by him, unwillingly ready to take any shots that come for SCP-7799-3, holding onto some kind of blind hope that no one on the battlefield will notice them.]
 
[Lancaster held onto this hope as well, but was fired upon at his waist.] 
  
**Lancaster:** Fuck! 
 
**Vladivostok:** No! Phil-Phils been hit man! 
 
**Calabasas:** Shit! Shit! 
 
**Lancaster:** I-I&#39;m... I&#39;m done for... 
 
[Before Lancaster tumbles to the ground, SCP-7799-3 grabs his arm and holds him close to its side.]
  
**SCP-7799-3:** I&#39;m still in need of your body. Stand up. 
 
**Lancaster:* Fuck.. I... I... 
 
**Vladivostok:** Phil! Can you hear me?!
 
**Calabasas:** Don&#39;t mind him, stay next to SCP-7799-3! 
 
**Vladivsotok:** But- 
 
[More bullets hit Lancaster, this time in his back.] 
 
**Vladivsotok:** No! 
  
[Lancaster coughs up multiple drops of blood before going completely limp. His body becomes too heavy for SCP-7799-3 to hold, so he is tossed to the ground.] 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** His services are no longer required.
 
**Vladivostok:** No! We gotta fucking go back for him! We&#39;ve made it this far with him! We can&#39;t just leave him! 
 
**Calabasas:** Do everything SCP-7799-3 says and we&#39;ll live! Fuck Phil! 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Dead weight gets left behind. 
 
[These words from SCP-7799-3 and Calabasas make Vladivostok clutch his fist and grind his teeth. Tears stream down his face as he stares with hatred at the two of them, specifically SCP-7799-3.]
 
**Vladivostok:** You fucking madman! You fucking //psychopath//! 
   
[Vladivostok lunges at SCP-7799-3.] 
 
**Calabasas:** Huh?! 
 
**SCP-7799-3:** What the hell?! 
 
[Vladivostok tackles SCP-7799-3 and bites its hand, causing it to drop its weapon. Vladivostok pushes it to the ground to viciously and prolifically beat and tear its smiley-faced head.]
   
**Vladivostok:** Fuck you! Fuck you, //fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you-//
 
**SCP-7799-3:** Get him off! 
 
[Calabasas attempts to grab Vladivostok off of SCP-7799-3, who in return pushes Calabasas away to continue his animal-like attack on SCP-7799-3. Calabasas is too afraid to touch Vladivostok.] 
  
**SCP-7799-3:** God, please! Get him off! 
  
[Vladivostok continues to attack before being pushed off by SCP-7799-3 itself. It gets back up and grabs its weapon, pointing it at a feral Vladivostok. It pants heavily as blood spills down its neck and the top of its round head.] 
  
**SCP-7799-3:** You&#39;ll regret that you little bastard! A bullet in your head will be enough to shut you up! 
 
[Suddenly, a helicopter flies dangerously close to the ground, just above SCP-7799-3. It is piloted by SCP-7799-4 instances as one of them hangs off the side with its hand outstretched.] 
  
**7799-4 Inst:** [Hungarian] We found ya, boss! C&#39;mon, let&#39;s get ya out of here! 
 
[SCP-7799-3 looks back at Calabasas and Vladivostok before getting closer to the helicopter. It looks back at Vladivostok.] 
  
**SCP-7799-3:** That asshole over there&#39;s right about you. [Chuckles] You&#39;re nothing but a worthless idiot who can&#39;t do anything right. 
 
**Calabasas:** Uh, yeah! Yeah! Anything you say! Please don&#39;t kill me! 
 
[SCP-7799-3 grabs the hand of the instance and climbs in. However, newly deployed tactical response officers notice this aircraft and open fire on its top propellor.] 
   
**Tactical R. Officer:** I want that chopper grounded now! 
 
**Tactical R. Officer:** Focus the propellers! 
 
[The helicopter sustains high damage before it can fully escape Site-88&#39;s airspace, causing it to spin out of control as SCP-7799-3 can be seen falling out of the helicopter and suffering a ten-meter drop before landing on a car in the parking lot, crushing it and multiple bones in the process.]
  
[After this sight, Vladivostok and Calabasas return to Lancaster.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** Phil! Can you hear me?! 
 
**Lancaster:** [Quiet moaning.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** Don&#39;t worry, man. We&#39;re gonna get help! Trust me! We&#39;ve made it this far! You&#39;re gonna make it! 
  
[Lancaster is quiet. No breathing can be discerned, nor a pulse after Vladivostok frantically checks.] 
  
**Vladivostok:** Phil?! Phil?! Phil! //PHIL!// 
 
[Vladivostok begins to sob over Lancaster&#39;s body and pound the ground with his fist until they begin to bleed. The sounds of gunfire and chaos fill the air around him, acting as a nihilistically upsetting crescendo as fire and explosion illuminate his shadow.] 
 
**Vladivostok:** What is wrong with me?! It&#39;s all my fault! I-it&#39;s all my fault...
 
[Vladivostok cries on the ground, feeling responsible for Lancaster&#39;s death. Out of all the bodies to mourn over on the battlefield, this one is of importance to Vladivostok. Calabasas has since abandoned Vladivostok in search of safety. In stark contrast, Vladivostok lays in this spot, sobbing to himself for the duration of the incident.]

[Whoever was speaking to SCP-7799-1 appears to have hung up. SCP-7799-1&#39;s eye veins show themselves to a greater extent as it crushes the phone in its hand. Nearby SCP-7799-2 instances back away.] 
   
**SCP-7799-1:** A-after all the-The audacity to... the sheer ineptitude of... I-I... 
 
[Suddenly, SCP-7799-1 begins to have a meltdown in which it breaks computers and screens in the control room, ripping buttons off the walls and stomping on thrown computers.]
 
**SCP-7799-1:** MOTHERFUCKER! BITCH! PIECE OF SHIT! FUCK THEM ALL TO FUCKING HELL! FUCKING BABYLON! FUCKING BABYLON SATANIST SODOMITE FUCKERS FUCK FUCK FUCK //FUCK//!!!!
 
[As SCP-7799-1&#39;s meltdown erodes and it regains composure, nearby SCP-7799-2 instances look at it with shock at its exclamation.]
  
**SCP-7799-1:** [Panting] I... I apologize for my outburst... I... don&#39;t know what came over me there. A-apologies to anyone who heard that... 
  
[SCP-7799-1 holds its crucifix necklace and enacts the sign of the cross before fully regaining its composure. An SCP-7799-2 instance commander walks in.] 
  
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{My lord, I regret to inform you that... our remaining forces have been neutralized. 100% of them exactly... I recommend that we do not send any further troops to the area.}} 
  
**SCP-7799-1:** That&#39;s fine.. that&#39;s okay. I can do that... go and stop any further mobilization for me, commander. Today has been a disappointment. You&#39;re a disappointment. 
 
**7799-2 Inst. Cmdr:** {{I.. apologize for my worthlessness, my lord-}} 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Just go away. 
 
[The commander leaves as SCP-7799-1 takes a seat in a chair it had thrown during its tantrum. It stares at the ceiling without a word.]

**SCP-7799-1:** Is that some kind of possum? 
 
**SCP-7799-2 Instance:** {{I am unsure.}} 
 
**SCP-7799-1:** Get rid of it! 
 
**SCP-7799-2 Instance:** {{Affirmative.}}

**After Action Report** 
 
All SCP-7799-2 and SCP-7799-4 instances attacking Site-88 have been neutralized. SCP-7799-3 was found in agony atop a crushed vehicle, where it was quickly placed into emergency anomalous care. Calabasas was found hiding within a plant and brought to safety. Vladivostok was recovered from the area he was last seen, still lying on the ground. He was promptly rescued and treated for minor injuries. Lancaster however, was put into emergency medical care, where he was later pronounced deceased.
 
Site-88 sustained moderate damage due to the breaching of several dangerous SCP objects, which were shortly re-contained by MTF-Epsilon-11. A total of ten Foundation personnel and sixteen tactical response officers were killed during the incident. (Around 90,000 dollars in damages). 
 
The Baldwin County Nuclear Power Plant sustained heavy damage to its parking lot and front gate, which suffered severe burn and explosion damage during the incident. So much so to the point where civilian social media posts have shown photos or short videos of the incident from long distances, which were promptly removed. News Coverage was allowed to record the aftermath of the incident, convinced of it being a &#34;wildfire&#34;. Several park rangers were stationed around the power plant to make this cover story appear more legitimate. (Around 250,00 dollars in damages).
  
A small funeral for the passing of those lost during the incident would take place three days afterward.
