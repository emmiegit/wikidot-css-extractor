Site-97 during Ennui protocol activation.

[[/div]]
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4224 is permanently located within a specialized containment cell within Site-97. SCP-4224 is to remain within its life support system permanently, and electricity is to be continuously supplied to the cell. A backup generator is also installed and automatically activated in the event of main power failure. Medical staff must constantly monitor SCP-4224&#39;s homeostatic status; any deviation from nominal levels must be immediately corrected. Secreted Substance RJ-O1 &#34;ROYAL JELLY&#34; is collected in a secure vessel exterior to SCP-4224&#39;s chamber. This vessel, and by extension all SCP-4224 products, are considered Class-V extreme biological hazards.  

255 instances of SCP-4224-1 are to be contained within a panopticon[[footnote]] Due to infection hazards, a regular prison risks too many personnel. A panoptical setup risks a minimal amount of guards without compromising security. [[/footnote]] located at Site-97. The cells are to be equipped with basic living facilities alongside an additional gas inlet, waste, and outlet pipes, as well as a wall-mounted monitor. Interactions with SCP-4224-1 instances are to be minimized, and guards must regularly be checked for DR-O1 &#34;DRONE&#34; infection.

Upon expiry of SCP-4224, an SCP-4224-1 instance is to be promoted to SCP-4224 status. Upon expiry of SCP-4224-1 instances, a random selection of D-Class without any notable characteristics, history or experience are to be exposed to DR-O1 followed immediately by RJ-O1 and contained as an SCP-4224-1 instance. SCP-4224-1 instances are to be conditioned to release Substance DR-O1 upon visual stimulation, while SCP-4224 is to be conditioned to release Substance RJ-O1 upon visual stimulation.

In accordance with the Ennui Protocol Directive, the majority of Site-97&#39;s functions are controlled by a remote terminal, accessible only to the O5 Council.

**Description:** SCP-4224 is a Russian female approximately 90 years old, named &#34;Natalya Ignatova&#34; prior to Foundation classification. Due to the deteriorating health of SCP-4224, it must be attached to a bespoke Foundation-created life support system. 

SCP-4224 produces two products at will, designated RJ-O1 and DR-O1. These substances are detailed below.
@@ @@
@@ @@
&gt; **__RJ-O1 &#34;ROYAL JELLY&#34;__**
&gt; 
&gt; **Characteristics:** Viscous, translucent liquid at room temperature. Visually resembles honey.
&gt; 
&gt; **Containment:** Contained in a chilled (5 ^^o^^C) Class-V biological hazard liquid tank.
&gt; 
&gt; **Effects:** Once RJ-O1 enters the digestive system in volumes greater than 500 mg, the individual is granted immunity to subsequent DR-O1 exposure. The individual&#39;s morphology changes to accommodate the generation of RJ-O1 and DR-O1 substances unique to the individual, allowing them to create these substances at will. Infectees are designated SCP-4224-1.
&gt; 
&gt; **Application:** Due to the unfamiliarity of secreting RJ-O1 and DR-O1 substances, individuals must be applied DR-O1 prior to RJ-O1 application. RJ-O1 may be administered orally or through injection. 

&gt; **__DR-O1 &#34;DRONE&#34;__**
&gt; 
&gt; **Characteristics:** Airborne viral pathogen. Invisible to the naked eye. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Containment:** Contained in a body-temperature (37 ^^o^^C) Class-V biological hazard aerosol tank or storage vat.
&gt; 
&gt; **Effects:** Infection causes only behavioural symptoms, detailed below. When infected, the pathogen causes massive neural remodelling to the host&#39;s brain. This process takes approximately two weeks to complete and is highly energy intensive, requiring a caloric intake of 5000 kcal/day to sustain. After infection of DR-O1, the process is irreversible.
&gt; 
&gt; After initial infection, the disease begins the transformation in the prefrontal cortex and progresses posteriorly. Meaning that personality is affected first, before affecting other areas such as facial recognition, memory, language, reading, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; After the process is complete the individual&#39;s connectome will mirror that of the individual that synthesized the DR-O1 substance, creating a neurologically identical copy. Infected individuals act autonomously, but identify as the parent except in cases where infiltration is required, such as assuming a position of authority. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Application:** For DR-O1 harvested before Ennui activation, an oral-nasal mask is attached to a DR-O1 tank and opened for 3 seconds once secured over the patient. Aseptic techniques must be followed when working with pre-Ennui DR-O1. DR-O1 harvested post-Ennui activation may be used freely.

**4224:** Well, I remembered that the hive nearly died the previous winter, and I doubted it would survive another. I was concerned, so I waited until the temperature was low so that the bees would be pacified. When I peered into the hive and saw thousands upon thousands of dead bees, piled atop each other. A pile of cold, fuzzy bodies. I ran back into the house and cried in front of the fire. Those bees were the closest thing to a pet I&#39;d had to that point.

**Addendum 4224-B: Heather Everwood&#39;s Research Request**
&gt; [[=]]
&gt; +++ Research Request
&gt; By Researcher Heather Everwood, Level 3
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; -----
&gt; **Request:** To formally diagnose Parkinson&#39;s disease within SCP-4224.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; **Reason:** From my observations of SCP-4224, it can&#39;t be denied that the signs of Parkinson&#39;s disease are obvious. However, site staff have neglected to formally diagnose the disease. The diagnosis is vital information not only to make informed decisions on what medication to give to SCP-4224, but also to understand the nature of DR-O1 &#34;Drone&#34;.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; For example, Parkinson&#39;s is a disease which affects the brain. Since DR-O1 copies the host&#39;s neural structure, one would expect to also see Parkinson&#39;s within the DR-O1 infectees. This is not the case; DR-O1 infectees show no signs of Parkinson&#39;s disease.
&gt; ------
&gt; **##990000|DENIED##** - SCP-4224 Lead Researcher, Frank Selks
&gt; //I&#39;ve denied this on principle. I&#39;ve said time and time again: Don&#39;t make requests on the official documentation. It&#39;s messy, undemocratic, and a pain in the ass. If you have any more research requests, file them to my desk.//
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; **##009900|OVERRULED##** - O5-7
&gt; -----
&gt; **Results:** SCP-4224 is Parkinson&#39;s disease positive.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; While DR-O1 infectees show no signs of Parkinson&#39;s, the areas where the Parkinson&#39;s disease is located in SCP-4224 are very different between subjects. In fact, it appears that DR-O1 only writes over brain matter, and ignores damaged sections. The implications of these results are still being discussed.
&gt; -----
&gt; **Comments:** This research will likely provide great insight into the inner workings of the Drone pathogen. I&#39;m honestly surprised that Researcher Selks didn&#39;t proceed with the diagnosis sooner. -- O5-7
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; Everwood ever-so-slightly beat me to the punch on publication. I was tracking the intensity of the tremors over the last few months to be certain of the diagnosis, but that unnecessary attention to detail seems to be something that I struggle with. -- Frank Selks

**Addendum 4224-C: NOTICE FROM THE OVERSEER COUNCIL**
&gt; [[=]]
&gt; ++ NOTICE FROM THE OVERSEER COUNCIL
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; -----
&gt; Effective immediately, SCP-4224 has been reclassified from Keter to Thaumiel. SCP-4224&#39;s threat level has been added to and is now dual red-white, rather than just red. This update has been due to recent discoveries regarding the nature of SCP-4224.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; Staff are reminded that SCP-4224 is __not neutralized__ and should not be considered as such. SCP-4224 should still be considered a Keter-Class SCP and is still to be respected. SCP-4224 is still capable of causing an IK-Class &#34;end-of-individuality&#34; scenario if it breaches containment. 
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; In addition, all staff are to be informed of the newly developed Ennui Protocol. The nature of this protocol is top secret, but the attached procedures are to be carried out once activated. 
&gt; [[&gt;]]
&gt; - O5-7
&gt; [[/&gt;]]
&gt; -----
&gt; **__Ennui Protocol Directive__** 
&gt; 
&gt; Upon activation of the Ennui Protocol, all contained SCP-4224-1 instances are relaxed with a sedative gas and Class-F amnestics. This induces a vegetative state where the SCP-4224-1 entities are rendered suggestible blank slates, where they may be influenced according to O5 Command using the monitors within each cell. 
&gt; 
&gt; Once completed, the waste gas is siphoned from the room via the waste gas pipe and neurodegenerative cognitohazards displayed on the monitors, causing complete, irreversible loss of all brain function, with the exception of the semantic memory in all SCP-4224-1 individuals. Substance DR-O1 is then harvested and stored within an industrial-size aerosol storage tank. After 40 days of harvest, the aerosol is released into the atmosphere via funnels camouflaged as smokestacks.

**O5-10:** Greetings, Doctor Everwood. I hope your journey was pleasant.

**Everwood:** As pleasant as it could be. Yourself?

**O5-10:** Let&#39;s cut the pleasantries, if you don&#39;t mind. We&#39;re both busy people, I&#39;m sure. Let&#39;s get to business.

**Everwood:** Alright.
@@ @@
**O5-10:** For the record, please state the nature of your complaint.
@@ @@
**Everwood:** I believe Frank Selks, SCP-4224&#39;s Lead Researcher, has been taking credit for others&#39; work, then proceeding to get their positions terminated before they have a chance to voice their side of things.
@@ @@
**O5-10:** That&#39;s quite a serious infraction, Doctor Everwoods. Do you have proof?
@@ @@
**Everwood:** It&#39;s come to my attention that Frank Selks, specifically, goes very quickly through Level-3 researchers, coinciding with major discoveries regarding SCP-4224. Researcher Taylor was relieved after Selks discovered that Drone only affects the neural web of the affected individual. Gomez was terminated after Selks proposed that RJ-O1 may give immunity to DR-O1&#39;s effects.

**O5-10:** This is odd, yes, but there&#39;s no clear cause and effect relat-

**Everwood:** (interrupting) And since I submitted the Ennui Protocol to Selks, I&#39;ve seen my video log transcripts being uploaded to the main file. I&#39;m certain he&#39;s trying to set me up.

**O5-10:** (pause) It has been reported that these logs are... unprofessional.

**Everwood:** Yes! Of course it&#39;s been reported. Selks reported them, didn&#39;t he?

**O5-10:** I&#39;m not at liberty to say.

**Everwood:** Well, he&#39;s cherry-picked them. There are over 30 video logs, but only 3 have been uploaded, trying to highlight my worst behaviour and make it seem like I have it out for him.
@@ @@
**O5-10:** (pause) It has also come to my attention that your relationship with SCP-4224 is no longer completely professional, is that correct? You&#39;ve been reported violating standard protocol when dealing with sentient SCP objects. Do you reject these claims?

**Everwood:** (pause) I don&#39;t see how this is relevant to my complaint.

**O5-10:** I&#39;m saying, as you&#39;ve become friendly with SCP-4224, you have a vested interest in seeing Researcher Selks demoted, yes?

//Researcher Everwood remains silent.//
@@ @@
**O5-10:** While more information is required, the Internal Affairs department will look over your case. If found guilty, researcher Selks will be terminated from his position, his research will be disqualified and retroactively fitted to reflect the true individuals responsible for the discoveries made.

**Everwood:** Thank you.
@@ @@
**O5-10:** However, your actions regarding SCP-4224 cannot be ignored. Neither can the fact that your presence has made an overall positive impact in SCP-4224&#39;s mental state. Normally, the ruling would range from demotion to termination of contract. I&#39;m of the opinion that breaking the relationship you&#39;ve forged with SCP-4224 would be a shame.

**O5-10:** Henceforth, your clearance has been demoted to 0-GENERAL with special 4/4224 clearance. You are no longer permitted to work with SCP objects, staff or Foundation Sites not relevant to SCP-4224. You may appeal after one year. Is that understood?

&gt; +++ Heather Everwood&#39;s Overseer Review
&gt; [[/=]]
&gt; -----
&gt; Two weeks after being reprimanded due to unusual behaviour regarding an SCP object, Heather Everwood has repeatedly breached protocol resulting in violations of safety protocol, gross misconduct and negligence. The circumstances of SCP-4224&#39;s death is unknown as Heather Everwood fails to comment on the matter.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; Heather Everwood was discovered the morning following SCP-4224&#39;s death inside their containment chamber, sat beside SCP-4224&#39;s life-support system. Dinner plates, breadcrumbs and playing cards were found on the chamber&#39;s floor.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; A new SCP-4224 has been promoted.

&gt; The caveat for Everwood&#39;s employment at the Foundation was dependent on the relationship between herself and SCP-4224. While it must be a heartbreaking time for Everwood, her employment contract must be terminated.

&gt; I&#39;ll see her off in person. She deserves that, at least.
