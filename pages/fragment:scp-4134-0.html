++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION 

The following is the original documentation for SCP-4134.
This document has been declassified for historical significance as well as relevance to ongoing SCP-4134 containment efforts, but may not reflect current understanding of the anomaly.

-- Maria Jones, Director, RAISA

**Item #:** SCP-4134

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** The Foundation will cooperate with leaders of various French Resistance groups, as well as the Vichy government, to safely contain SCP-4134-1 instances within the city of Paris. Research is ongoing to determine the origin of SCP-4134 and contain or neutralise the anomaly, if at all possible.
SCP-4134-1 instances are to be contained in Foundation warehouse located at [DATA REDACTED] by members of ATF Sacre-2 (&#34;Mimesweepers&#34;) using Procedure 4134-Harpo (see Document 4134-Harpo).

**Description:** SCP-4134 refers to a pattern of behavior affecting an as-yet-unknown number of mimes within the city of Paris, France. 

Mimes affected by SCP-4134 (designated SCP-4134-1) will travel on foot to areas of high foot traffic within the city. Upon reaching a suitable location, SCP-4134-1 instances will take a kneeling position with both arms extended forward from the shoulder. At this point, SCP-4134-1 instances are considered &#34;armed&#34; and will remain completely immobile until triggered. When armed, any force which displaces either hand of SCP-4134-1 more than 3cm will trigger a directional explosion outward from a point in space no more than 30 centimeters in front of the instance&#39;s chest, typically resulting in the destruction of both hands. 

After detonation, SCP-4134-1 instances become non-anomalous, typically showing panic and confusion at their injuries. Expiration due to blood loss is common without immediate medical treatment. The Foundation estimates that over ███ mimes have been killed as a result of SCP-4134, or roughly 14% of the mime population of France, with containment efforts thus far causing an additional 29 Foundation casualties and 61 civilian casualties due to accidental activation of SCP-4134-1 instances.

The Foundation currently has ██ SCP-4134-1 instances in Foundation containment. Research into the origin of SCP-4134 is ongoing (see Interview Log 4134.1), but as of yet the anomaly has not been definitively tied with any GoI, entity, meme, or cognitohazard.

**Discovery:** The first known instance of SCP-4134-1 was discovered following the assassination of Ermst vom Rath outside the German Embassy in Paris on 09/11/1938. Foundation operatives intercepted a telegram sent to [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/skp-portal Sonderkommando für Paranormales], which described an explosion of unknown source from a mime with &#34;inconsistent&#34; blast damage. Data was found to correlate with a previous Extranormal Event which occurred during the capture of SCP-████, prompting the designation of SCP-4134.

&gt; **Date:** 12.14.1940
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Richard
&gt; **Interviewee:** Pablo Laurent, a.k.a. &#34;Fleur-nez&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Purpose:** To determine the nature of SCP-4134, as well as identify potential origin of SCP-4134, an interview was conducted with a surviving SCP-4134-1 instance. Mr. Laurent is a mime, typically performing under the name &#34;Fleur-nez,&#34; recovered on Rue ████████ with major trauma to both hands. Both arms were amputated at the elbow.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Richard:** Good morning, Mr. Laurent. How are you feeling this morning?
&gt; 
&gt; //Mr. Laurent shrugs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Richard:** //(in English)// Would you prefer I conduct this interview in English?
&gt; 
&gt; //Mr. Laurent shrugs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Richard:** //(in English)// Why won&#39;t- oh, of course. //(Dr. Richard switches to French sign language)// Good morning, Mr. Laurent. Can you understand me?
&gt; 
&gt; //Mr. Laurent nods.//
&gt; 
&gt; **R:** Why were you at the █████ ████████ that day?
&gt; 
&gt; //Mr. Laurent holds up his arms, which have been amputated at the elbow.//
&gt; 
&gt; **R:** Right. Do you remember why you were at the █████ ████████ that day?
&gt; 
&gt; //Mr. Laurent shakes his head.//
&gt; 
&gt; **R:** How did you cause the explosion that destroyed your arms?
&gt; 
&gt; //Mr. Laurent shrugs quizzically and shakes his head.//
&gt; 
&gt; **R:** Do you know who or what caused you to do all this?
&gt; 
&gt; //Mr. Laurent motions with his right arm at the wall behind Dr. Richard. On the wall is the flag of France.//
&gt; 
&gt; **R:** Can you elaborate on that?
&gt; 
&gt; //Mr. Laurent holds up his arms, which have been amputated at the elbow.//
&gt; 
&gt; **R:** Oh, right.
&gt; 
Mr. Laurent was held for an additional 48 hours, amnesticized, and released. Review of past medical records shows that Mr. Laurent is a deaf-mute.

As of 11/28/1940, SCP-4134-1 instances have killed over ██ Nazi soldiers, including the high-profile █████ ███ ██████ and his wife in front of the Eiffel Tower in October 1940. No Allied casualties have been reported. Statistical analysis is ongoing.
