+ **Special Containment Procedures:**
[[/=]]

+++ **Archived Procedures:**
[[/=]]

It is imperative that SCP-7599-1 and SCP-7599-2 are never found.

Through the help of the IRCR, both instances of SCP-7599 have been contained inside of a pocket reality, titled 7599-Ω. The location and coordinates of this reality have been permanently deleted from all IRCR and SCP documents, and wiped from the memories of all personnel who worked on the initial construction of 7599-Ω through the usage of Class C retrograde amnestics.

If 7599-Ω is altered in any way and SCP-7599 is unable to be secured, Procedure Casus is to be put into action immediately, and details about SCP-7599 and 7599-Ω are to be temporarily given to all agents in the department responsible for it&#39;s safety.

As of 1/7/22, SCP-7599 has been neutralized. 7599-Ω has been destroyed, and it&#39;s location has been made public to all personnel previously working on it. No further containment procedures or documentation has been deemed necessary.

+ **Description:**
[[/=]]

SCP-7599 referred to two six-sided, cube-shaped dice, made out of a black, unknown substance that chemically and physically resembled plastic.

SCP-7599&#39;s anomalous effects manifested when at least one of the instances were in close proximity to a human being. That person (from then on, known as an SCP-7599-A instance) would start to experience events with odds that would, over time, decrease.

These events would initially have almost always benefited SCP-7599-A, whether directly or indirectly. However, as SCP-7599&#39;s effects progressed, these events would also go on to harm others. SCP-7599&#39;s &#34;luck&#34; led to other people&#39;s injury, death and derangement as long as its host was not physically or materially affected.

After a certain point, events with incredibly low probabilities (that are perceived as statistically impossible[[footnote]] A statistically impossible event is defined as an event with a definite probability lower than 10^^-50^^. While not completely impossible, the odds of such an event occurring are so low that they are not expected to ever happen in normal conditions and are thus considered not possible.[[/footnote]]) would begin to manifest around SCP-7599-A. Such events would lead to large harm to SCP-7599-A&#39;s environment and reality if allowed to continue.[[footnote]] Realities that face prolonged damage through the manifestation of anomalous events are prone to CK-Class &#34;Reality Restructuring&#34; events. See IRCR notes. [[/footnote]]

-----

SCP-7599-Δ, formerly Reality-102 of Project Probinum, is an abyssal reality that has faced a complete collapse. Before it&#39;s usage in the neutralization of SCP-7599, SCP-7599-Δ was in partial collapse, and all attempts to open permanent portals into it had proven futile. However, a way to enter the reality and open an entrance into it, albeit temporarily, had been devised.

SCP-7599-Δ housed 7000-Δ1, an unknown entity presumed to have been Jack Midway Doyle, previously known as 7599-A1. No other signs of life had been detected in the reality except for it, and all attempts at communication had directed to 7599-Δ1. (See Addendum 7599.1.)
‎ 
[[=]]
+ **Addendum 7599.1: Reclassification**
[[/=]]
SCP-7599 was reclassified following communications between SCP-7599-Δ and the IRCR being set up. A large, anomalous event was found to have been the culprit of the reality beginning to collapse through a CK Class Reality Restructuring event, and journal entries recovered from the reality showed that SCP-7599 was to blame. Investigations began into trying to figure out what exactly had happened, led by the IRCR&#39;s communication specialists.

After extensive trial and error, a connection with SCP-7599-Δ1 was formed on the 13th of June, 2022 and is transcribed as follows.

++++ Transcript of initial communication with SCP-7599-Δ

**21:03:** Connection is formed between Specialist and Delta via phone.
Spec: Hello? Can you hear me?
**21:04:** No response is heard. Settings are reconfigured.
Spec: //Hello?//
Delta: Good evening.
**21:05:** Connection cuts out once more.
Spec: Who am I speaking to?
Delta: Mr. Doyle. Who is this?
Spec: Full name?
Delta: Jack Midway Doyle.
**21:06:** Name is researched by on-site personnel. A match is found on SCP-7599&#39;s archived file.
Delta: Is it //you// again? Are you back to torture me? 
Spec: You? We are from the IRCR. We don&#39;t mean hostility, we&#39;re just res-
Delta: Of course. It is you.
**21:07:** Connection worsens.
Spec: Mr. Doyle, are you aware of the current situation your reality is in?
Delta: Everyone&#39;s fucking dead. There&#39;s nothing left for you, Braum.
Spec: My name is Theodore White. Dr. Braum is currently not here.
Delta: Are you the ones responsible for this? Are you some kind of gods playing tricks with me?
Spec: For what? Mr. Doyle, we&#39;re trying to understand what&#39;s happened, too. Please, no need for hostility.
Delta: Leave me the hell alone. Fuck you. Fuck you for everything you&#39;ve done to me.
Spec: We don&#39;t me-
**21:08:** Communications fully end. The IRCR is unable to restore them.

**[END TRANSCRIPT]**

[[/div]]

Throughout the following week, the IRCR, on multiple occasions, attempted to converse with SCP-7599-‎Δ1, only three of which were successful. While SCP-7599-‎Δ1 showed extremely signs of hostility at first, they were able to be calmed in the final call and were successfully interviewed by Spec. Theodore White on the 19th of June.

SCP-7599 was declared the reason behind the CK class event in 7000-‎Δ, and 7599-‎Δ1 was interrogated further about everything that had occurred before the partial collapse, and the journal entries it had written. Shortly after 7599&#39;s true effects were discovered through the help of 7599-‎Δ, it was re-classified by the IRCR and contained.

[[=]]
+++ PROPOSAL FOR PROJECT &#34;THROW THE DICE&#34;

+++++ Proposed by Senior Researcher Alan Collins and Erika Braum
+++++ For review by the O5 Council and IRCR administration

There is no doubt, not a single one, that SCP-7599 will breach containment. //It is an inevitable truth//. 

From the very beginning, we saw how people seemed to drool over the idea of securing SCP-7599 and using it for themselves. It was an anomaly which had power that none of us could have imagined, sure, but it was still stupid to believe that it was completely harmless. Look no further than our first rounds of testing- SCP-7599 had the very ability to manipulate death itself. Anyone who got their hands on it could have the universe&#39;s cards dealt in their favor, permanently, whether friend or foe.

Now we&#39;ve seen what it really does, and we&#39;ve realized what we have to do. Seal it away permanently and hide it not only from our enemies, but also ourselves. And no matter how much it seems to be working right now, it&#39;s not going to work in the long run. 

Our &#34;containment&#34; of 7599 hinges on the fact that nobody knows, or for more appropriate wording, remembers the location of its pocket reality. And while amnestics are effective at concealing memories, they&#39;re not effective enough to wipe every remnant of the location of 7599-Ω out of it&#39;s architects&#39; minds. Mnestics are just one of the simple methods that could be utilized to resurface those memories.

So, the conclusion is simple, and one that we can all agree on: 7599 must be neutralized. And it must be done quickly. I am aware that a proposal for this has been made before, in the form of sending 7599 to another reality close to ours. There are some undeniable problems with this idea, of course. We risk many things: causing irreparable damage to more realities and having 7599 returned to our reality.

We, as the seniors of the IRCR propose a similiar solution, one that, at the very least, solves one of these worries.

The proposal is simple. We&#39;ve discovered a way to open a temporary passage into 7599-Δ, and we know that the entry of an object or entity foreign to the reality would cause an almost instantaneous collapse. By utilizing this entrance and having both instances of 7599 discarded into the reality, we contain (and effectively neutralize) SCP-7599, permanently. The reality collapses, and no matter how much anyone tries, 7599 will never be reached again. We will have no more reason to worry.

Of course, as I&#39;m sure most of the council is already aware, this doesn&#39;t come without any adverse consequences. Due to such a sudden and violent collapse, other realities interconnected with 7599-Δ in our multiverse face the risk of being permanently harmed and possibly collapsing too. We can stop it from becoming a chain reaction and finding it&#39;s way to us, but there is still the relatively large chance that at least one of those 6 realities is irreversibly damaged.

That is why there is a choice to be made by the council. Either we put ourselves in peril, or we gamble and protect ourselves against the threat that&#39;s reared its fatal, nuclear head at our true goal: defending baseline reality.

It&#39;s time to take a chance. I trust the council will make the right choice.

+ **Addendum 7599.4: Procedure 7599-NTR**
[[/=]]

SCP-7599 was neutralized on the morning of 30.6.22, following the completion of Procedure 7599-NTR, in which both instances were discarded into 7599-Δ in the presence of 10 members of the IRCR&#39;s security and research departments, including Dr. Alan Collins, who oversaw the process[[footnote]] Dr. Erika Braum was not present, despite assisting Dr. Alan Collins in preparation. [[/footnote]]. The full collapse of 7599-Δ took 13 minutes and 27 seconds.

Shortly before the full collapse of 7599-Δ, Dr. Alan Collins&#39; phone received the following email from an unknown email account.
