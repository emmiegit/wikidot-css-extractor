**Item #:** SCP-1486

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1486 is to be kept in Containment Locker 392b at Site-46. Following incident 1486-8, a 55-meter spherical radius is to be demarcated around SCP-1486 as an area in which absolutely no copulation is to occur.

**Description:** SCP-1486 is a children&#39;s doll, 48 centimeters in height. SCP-1486 is animate; however, due to its nature it is mostly immobile. SCP-1486 is highly damaged, and is missing its right arm. SCP-1486 will frequently exude human blood, feces, pus, and cervical mucus from small pores covering its torso and head. SCP-1486 is seemingly sapient.

If a fertile, human couple of opposite sexes completes copulation within ~50 meters of SCP-1486 (regardless of contraceptive use), SCP-1486 will disappear from where it has been placed and appear in the female subject&#39;s uterus at less than 0.01% of its original size[[footnote]]Whether this effect is achieved through use of the same phenomena as observed in [[[SCP-886]]], [[[SCP-1263]]], [[[SCP-1586]]], or a combination thereof is currently unknown.[[/footnote]]. SCP-1486 will then begin slowly increasing in size at the rate of a normal embryo and foetus[[footnote]] For financial and ethical concerns, testing regarding the subject body&#39;s acceptance and nourishment of SCP-1486 has not been performed. For more information read Dr. Fulnan&#39;s paper: //SCP-1486: Hypotheses regarding the placenta and immune system//. [[/footnote]]. Ultrasound testing of the subject has shown that SCP-1486 retains its shape throughout the growth process. Subjects may sustain damage to the uterine wall, causing infertility. Excretions from SCP-1486 will exit through the cervix.

After a period of ~9 months, SCP-1486 will induce labor in the subject. SCP-1486 may be birthed normally. However, due to the presence of several harsh edges on its exterior, Caesarian sections have proven to be a much safer form of delivery.

Once it has been birthed, SCP-1486 will search for the subject mother and in some instances, SCP-1486 will attempt to breastfeed unless restrained. SCP-1486 can communicate verbally through unknown means, and will address the subject and others.

Attempted abortion results in SCP-1486 rapidly expanding, causing the subject&#39;s abdomen to rupture. SCP-1486 will be immediately hostile.

SCP-1486 was discovered by Foundation operatives following a complaint submitted by [REDACTED] after an ultrasound imaging session.

**Addendum 1486-1:**

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-1486
&gt;  
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Fulnan
&gt;  
&gt; **Foreword:** SCP-1486 had recently been birthed and was sitting with D-7397, its &#34;mother&#34;, at the time of interview. D-7397 had been sedated and was unconscious.
&gt;  
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Fulnan:** Hello SCP-1486.
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-1486:** Hey doc, long time no see.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Fulnan:** Indeed.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1486:** 9 months, if I had to guess (Laughs). How&#39;s it hanging?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fulnan:** It&#39;s fine. Mind if I ask a few questions?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1486:** Shoot.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fulnan:** Alright. Who or what made you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1486:** Well doc, when a mommy and a daddy really love each other, or are really fucking drunk...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fulnan:** Please answer the question.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1486:** How do you think? My momma got laid and I happened to be the fastest sperm.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fulnan:** Alright. How did you become damaged?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1486:** Being born isn&#39;t fucking easy, you can get pretty torn up. I think I would know that better than anyone.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fulnan:** Okay. So this woman is your mother?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1486:** Yeah, this woman here&#39;s my momma. Might not be the best looker, but she&#39;s got the best tits I&#39;ve ever seen.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fulnan:** So you&#39;ve seen tits before this?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1486:** It&#39;s an expression, dumbass.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fulnan:** But what about all the times you&#39;ve been, er, born before this?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1486:** What?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fulnan:** You don&#39;t remember being born before this birth?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1486:** Well, yeah, of course I do.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fulnan:** Were the women those times not your mother?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1486:** I thought they were, but they would scream and throw me away. How could they be my momma if they would do that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fulnan:** They gave birth to you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1486:** Well, yeah, but I mean they hate me. How could a mother hate her own kid, doc? Enough to hurt them so much?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fulnan:** Lots of mothers...
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1486:** It doesn&#39;t make any sense! How could they just throw me away? How could they just hammer it in like that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fulnan:** Well, I mean...
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1486:** I just don&#39;t get it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Fulnan:** 1486?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1486:** Can we stop please?
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt;  
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Examination of SCP-1486 following the interview showed a severely increased excretion of cervical mucus from the area surrounding its eyes. SCP-1486 was separated from D-7397 and placed into storage.
