My entire body tenses to the loud clanging of a metal can I accidentally knocked off a table, the sound echoing though the industrial hall. Silence. Then a sigh of relief. 

I haven&#39;t seen any of them today, but their presence never leaves my mind. Flashes of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-610 red flesh] oozing over what I can only assume to be a human. I can smell the stench of rot and puss in each wall around me. It&#39;s there, even when they&#39;re not. 

No matter, it&#39;s just life now. The same it&#39;s been the last month, and the one before that. And the one before... focus. It&#39;s just past these few buildings. A whole storage of dry food possibly gone unnoticed by any other group. Probably a lost cause, but worth the shot. Lots of mouths to feed back at the base. 

Peeking my head out of the door, I see nothing. Move swiftly, to the adjacent building. The open sky is as soothing as the open area around me is terrifying. The skyscraper in the far distance is possibly just ever so slightly more covered in the sickly red substance than last week. Maybe, but that&#39;s not what&#39;s important now. The door I reach is surprisingly open, and I am greeted with the sight of one of the flesh. Burned and crispy, but fresh. Looks like I might have company. I pull out my handgun.

As I move along the hallway, I cannot believe my ears. Music, actual music. What was once fantastic sends nothing but terror down my spine. Someone must either be insane or just lost all fucks to give. And yet... I find my foot tapping to the beat emanating from somewhere ahead of me. 

It&#39;s here, right past these double doors. By the sound of it, the flesh has gotten here before me. My mind offers me no good reasons to look inside, but the music.. it&#39;s just been so long. I open the doors ever so slightly in order to get a peek of what awaits me inside. 

Holy shit...

Right there before my eyes, limbs of irregularly shaped flesh, keratin and cartilage, moving in rhythm to the tunes spreading so easily around the hall. The feeling of sheer shock and intrigue flow over me as I find myself unable to do nothing but stare. The moist smell of rot almost makes me retch, but those horrific bodies of twisted bones and crusted layers of scarring moving so fluidly in rhythm is enticing. A dry piece of a limb falls here, a puff of spores spreading there. But the dancing is not hampered. I am greeted with feelings I had considered mostly lost to me. All that time spent on the stage before all... this... what even is this?

The music stops abruptly, causing me to recoil slightly and retreat just a bit further into the hall behind me.

&#34;Timothy, you know I love you. But kick-step, kick-step, body-roll is not rocket science!&#34;

&#34;Yeah yeah I know but...&#34;

&#34;Kick-step, kick-step, body-roll!&#34;

What the hell are they gurgling about? It&#39;s like they&#39;re actually talking to each other. What the fuck is going on here?

&#34;Listen Lance, it&#39;s been what, 3 hours now. Can&#39;t we take a break?&#34;

&#34;Oh sure. If you want to end up second like last year, then have your breaks all you want! I am NOT losing to William and his posse again!&#34;

&#34;You mean WE aren&#39;t losing.&#34;

&#34;//Sigh// Yes, WE. Now where&#39;s Greg? Is he seriously still sporing in the bathroom?&#34;

The world around me has been shattered again. This isn&#39;t possible, I can&#39;t think straight. 
My eyes catch movement right in front of me. One of the hinges supporting the other door had failed, causing it to screech loudly before banging against the wall. I hold my breath out of instinct, but it&#39;s clear that hiding is out of the question.

&#34;What the... a human!? Get it! They can&#39;t be allowed to know!&#34;

I stumble backwards before bolting back towards where I came from. Gladly the flesh has never been fast to move. Then why am I hearing them behind me? If this is a dream, please wake up now.

I see the door through which I entered the building. Instead of crashing though, I am thrown back on the floor after hitting it. It&#39;s locked? It can&#39;t be! And I can hear them, just around the corner. My eye catches another door, the bathrooms, which I barge through with haste. The window is broken, but blocked with debris on the outside. There&#39;s no time, the stalls are my only hope. Close the door, crouch on top of the cracked toilet, and hold my breath. I can hear them... maybe they didn&#39;t see me slip into this room.

&#34;Ohhh man. Guys, Greg has been torched.&#34;

&#34;No no no NO NO! This isn&#39;t happening! We&#39;re a dancer short, and the dance-off is in 6 days!&#34;

&#34;Shit... let&#39;s just get this human now. We still have time to consider our options.&#34;

&#34;Wait a second. Guys, hear me out...&#34;

It feels like I&#39;ve been sitting here for hours. They&#39;re still gurgling outside the bathroom. Calm down, it&#39;s just a matter of time until they move on. Wait, was that the door I heard? Please, please just go away. 
The door is pushed ever so slightly towards me before it begins to violently shake. The next second there is no door between me and the flesh. I unload my clip against the creatures in front of me to no effect. It can&#39;t end like this. I can&#39;t go out on the toilet like Elvis. 

&#34;Say human. I like the way you moved those feet.&#34; 

I&#39;m sorry. I won&#39;t be coming back with food. I&#39;m so sorry. I close my eyes as the red appendages reach towards me.

....

My foot sets on the stage in sync with the others. Then the other one, followed by the third. Kick-step, kick-step, body-roll. Left foot moves to the front while my neck sounds a crunch, moving to face the ceiling. Something flaky sheds off the top of my head. The moisture around me feels great, but doesn&#39;t compare to the thrill I&#39;m feeling. I have taken in the flesh, and let out my inhibitions, my troubles and my responsibilities. There is only the flesh and the rhythm. And I&#39;ve never been happier.

Oh yeah. William&#39;s so going down.
