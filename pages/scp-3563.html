**Item #:** SCP-3563

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to its nature, SCP-3563 cannot be contained at this time. Containment efforts of SCP-3563 should instead be focused on determining locations in which additional manifestations may occur. 

In the event that a manifestation of SCP-3563 is confirmed, Foundation personnel are to be deployed to the reported location immediately. A standard 50m² Federal Bureau of Investigation grade mobile morgue unit is to be established over SCP-3563, and the surrounding area is to be marked off with police tape corresponding to the appropriate local metro police department. Two level-2 guards are to be stationed outside of the morgue unit until such a time that SCP-3563 disperses. Guards stationed outside of SCP-3563&#39;s mobile containment unit are to be outfitted with uniforms appropriate to local police force. 

Civilians affected by SCP-3563 are to be administered Class-A amnestics and released from Foundation custody. 

**Description:** SCP-3563 is a phenomenon that occurs throughout New England, primarily affecting southern Maine and northern New Hampshire. Manifestations of SCP-3563 only occur in towns with populations of at least five hundred, but no more than one thousand. Foundation researchers have determined that manifestations of SCP-3563 only occur when locations matching the following criteria are present:

* An abandoned or vacant home that has previously been on the market. 
* The neighborhood surrounding abandoned home has families currently living in said neighborhood. 
* Abandoned home must have previously been owned by a family with at least one child. 
* Child of previous owners is either missing or deceased. 

Manifestations of SCP-3563 appear exclusively outside of locations that meet the above conditions, typically at the end of the driveway of said home, or on the front yard. 
SCP-3563 manifestations are comprised of two components, SCP-3563-1, and SCP-3563-2.
SCP-3563-1 is a lemonade stand built from non-anomalous plywood and timber[[footnote]]Though has been recorded as being built from birchwood on three occasions, and oakwood on two.[[/footnote]], kept together with cap nails and screws. In at least 85% of recorded manifestations, SCP-3563-1 has been noted to have a sign posted above its counter that reads &#34;Lemonabe[sic], 25¢!&#34; in red and yellow crayon or paint. 

SCP-3563-2 is a human child of varying gender, race, and ethnic background but always appearing between the ages of seven and twelve. DNA testing has confirmed that SCP-3563-2 entities directly correspond to real-world children who have been declared missing or deceased within at least two years of SCP-3563 manifesting. 

SCP-3563-2 will try to sell lemonade to any human beings for a quarter, though have been noted to also sell pink lemonade, iced tea, and an unknown liquid metal with consistency similar to tar. SCP-3563-2&#39;s behavior is typical of children of its age; instances have consistently been friendly with Foundation personnel. 

Any humans who purchase and consume lemonade bought from SCP-3563 will be compelled to enter the vacant home in which SCP-3563-1 is premised. SCP-3563-2 will continue to sell lemonade until at least ██ humans have entered the house, at which point SCP-3563-2 will leave SCP-3563-1 and enter the home. SCP-3563-2 then proceeds to [DATA EXPUNGED], leaving behind only the organs, monetarily valuable on person belongings, and -- on several occasions -- teeth that have been filled with precious metals.

Attempts to follow SCP-3563-2 into the home, or prevent SCP-3563-2 from entering, have resulted in the deaths of at least █ Foundation personnel. Attempts to locate SCP-3563-2 afterwards have resulted in little success, with tracking devices going offline as soon as SCP-3563 disperses, and attempts to follow SCP-3563-2 leading to the entity disappearing as soon as line of sight is broken.

**Interview Log SCP-3563-2-03**
&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-3563-2-03
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Guest Researcher Dr. ██████
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Interview was conducted on 03/09/20██ in order to ascertain the correlation between SCP-3563-2 and the real-world children they correspond to. DNA testing has confirmed that SCP-3563-2-03 is Dexter Hawshore, an eight-year-old boy who was found dead in ████████, Massachusetts eight months earlier outside of //Barrymore Brothers Candy Barrel//; cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head. Dexter apparently tripped and collided with the concrete. 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Hello, are you selling lemonade?
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-3563-2-03:** Yep! Mr Ha-... Mom and pop said if I can make five dollars they&#39;ll take me to the candy store, and let me get whatever I want. 
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Let me guess, the Candy Barrel?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3563-2-03:** //Subject pauses, taking a few moments before responding.// Wanna buy some of my lemonade? It&#39;s homemade, pop helped me squeeze the lemons himself. Only a quarter!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** And when was the last time you saw your father? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3563-2-03:** That&#39;s an easy one! I saw him-... //Subject falls silent for a moment, looking at the ground.// Huh... Uhm, say, wanna buy some lemonade? It&#39;s homemade, pop helped me squeeze it himself!
&gt;  
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** It would appear that there is a direct connection between SCP-3563-2 and the children that they seem to represent, though the means through which this connection is established is still unknown. SCP-3563 dispersed seventeen minutes after interview.

**Interview Log SCP-3563-2-08**
&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-3563-2-08

&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Interview was conducted on 12/02/20██, directly after SCP-3563-2-08 had entered the abandoned home. Subject was covered in  human cerebrospinal fluid at the time of interview. Dental records confirm that subject is Daniella Oakes, an eleven-year-old girl who has been missing for four months. 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **D-1252:** J-Jesus fucking Christ, this place is a mess.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3563-2-08:** Hi! I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t have any lemonade left to sell, I just finished squeezing out the very last drop.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-1252:** What... Happened in here? Doc, am I supposed to be asking this kid something?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Grant:** I need you to ask it about its memories, if it remembers anything prior to three months ago. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-1252:** Alright, uh... Right, so uh, what&#39;s your deal, kid? You a ghost or something? According to the papers I got you&#39;ve been missing for three months.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3563-2-08:** Nuh uh, no way! Ghost aren&#39;t real, my daddy says so. Besides, I&#39;ve been playing with Mr. Hat until today! He said that I&#39;m gonna help him make money, so I&#39;m selling lemonade!
&gt; 
&gt; **D-1252:** Right, and this Mr. Hat is what, your dad? Do you remember the day you went missing?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3563-2-08:** Nuh uh, I haven&#39;t seen daddy since uh... Since he said he wanted to go walking in the woods, so we went on a nature hike and then-... Uhm. //Subject falls silent for several moments.// I&#39;m sorry, I have to go now. 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Subject proceed to flee the home, D-1252 was instructed to follow the entity, but lost sight of it as soon as it got out the back door. SCP-3563 dispersed shortly after. Investigation into an entity known as &#39;Mr. Hat&#39; is underway. 

**Interview Log SCP-3563-2-14**
&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-3563-2-14
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Grant
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Interview was conducted on 04/02/20██. SCP-3563-2-14 had succeeded in selling █ cups of lemonade before Foundation personnel arrived on scene. Mobile task force units were deployed into the home in which SCP-3563 had manifested, and extracted the civilians inside. Civilians were thereafter administered Class-A amnestics and released. DNA test were inconclusive, and the identity of SCP-3563-2-14 is unknown. Subject is male, appears to be between the ages of ten and twelve, and is of African-American descent. 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Grant:** Hello SCP-3563, how are you today?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3563-2-14:** Hey mister, want to buy some lemonade? It&#39;s real cheap, only a quarter. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Grant:** What can you tell me about &#39;Mr. Hat&#39;?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3563-2-14** I don&#39;t understand the question, what is this? How do you know about-... What&#39;s happening? //Subject becomes visibly uncomfortable, scratching at its arm in agitation.// Do you want to buy some lemonade, sir? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Grant:** Answer the question, SCP-3563. Who is Mr. Hat? Did you meet them after you disappeared?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3563-2-14:** Mr... No, I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not supposed to talk to strangers about business models I-... He&#39;ll hurt me if I do. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Grant** Who will, Mr. Hat?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3563-2-14:** The man in the hat, he&#39;s coming for you now. You shouldn&#39;t have asked so many questions.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Grant:** This man in the hat, what does he look like?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3563-2-14:** Would you like to buy some lemonade? It&#39;s only a quarter. 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Subject became unresponsive after this, continuing to try to sell lemonade in lieu of answering questions. SCP-3563 dispersed thirty minutes later. Approximately two hours later, Dr. Grant was found dead floating in the ██████ river, almost four kilometers away from the initial SCP-3563 manifestation. Autopsy reports indicate Dr. Grant was beaten to death with a brick, with blood splatter and misting consistent with similar bludgeoning cases.

**Addendum 3563-a:** On 08/14/20██, the Foundation received reports from deep cover agents that large amounts of organs and other valuable human organic matter had been sold on the underground market in ████████████, Maine. Agents were tasked with locating the buyer, and were led to James ██████, a 24-year-old narcotics dealer who had purchased the organs, along with several watches, three leather wallets, and thirteen teeth that had been filled with pure grade silver. When questioned about where he had gotten these items, subject told Foundation agents that he bought them from a &#39;man in a dark overcoat, wearing a brimmed hat&#39;. He was unable to answer any further questions in regards to who he had purchased the items from, citing that it had been &#39;real dark&#39; at the time. Subject was administered Class-A amnestics, and released into the custody of local authorities. 

**Addendum 3563-b:** As of 09/24/20██, the &#39;Man in the Hat&#39; has been designated as Foundation POI-528. Foundation agents are to report any further large quantities of organs being sold on the black market in New England directly to Site-██.
