&#34;It all started when stingrays began spewing from the air vents.&#34;

Dr. Daniel Horatio Aeslinger, Psy.D., the psychologist currently on temporary assignment at Site-82, tapped his pencil against his lips.

&#34;Go on, Agent Bouchard.&#34;

The man in front of him hesitated.

&#34;Well, at first we didn&#39;t even notice. I mean, when you have a permanently PMSing giant lizard-thing and a homicidal immortal freak in a stone giftbox in lock-up, stingrays aren&#39;t exactly high on your oh-shit-o-meter. I guess I registered a kind of wet flopping sound as I chewed my way through my lunch.

Aeslinger cleared his throat. &#34;So, you were eating lunch and stingrays started emerging from the air vents?&#34;

&#34;Right. So, at first it was just stingrays. Then came the sharks.&#34;

&#34;Sharks, you say?&#34;

Aeslinger started scribbling notes.

&#34;Sharks, yes. Of course, most of them didn&#39;t fit through, so they got stuck. I swear I&#39;ve never heard a sound like it. Kind of like Emerson trying to get up the stairs to processing, up on level 14. You know Emerson? He&#39;s this morbidly ob-&#34;

&#34;I know Emerson, yes. I work with him occasionally. Back to the sharks please.&#34;

&#34;Uh...sure. So now there&#39;s stingrays flopping around, sharks bellowing from the air vents, jaws snapping continuously, and we&#39;re just sitting there, looking around at the mess. And that&#39;s when it happens.&#34;

&#34;Yes?&#34;

&#34;A tiger shark manages to wriggle free and drops right down onto Helen Stapel, you know, from accounting?&#34;

Aeslinger looked horrified and for a moment professionalism was just another word in the dictionary.

&#34;Oh my god, it must&#39;ve been a bloodbath.&#34;

&#34;Not really, shark hit her in the head and she bounced off the table. Knocked her right out.&#34;

Aeslinger sat up straight and nodded.

&#34;Oh. Well, a small victory then. Any day where someone doesn&#39;t get bitten in half by a falling tiger shark is a good day.&#34;

Bouchard looked at him funny. 

&#34;I guess so, Doc. Anyway, after about 15 minutes, there&#39;s no more of them. The stingrays and most of the sharks are dead or dying, and that one tiger shark is flopping around trying to bite people&#39;s ankles. And all this time, no one&#39;s said a thing. Screams, sure, but no conversation.&#34;

&#34;Really? How odd.&#34;

&#34;Not really. I mean, sure, we&#39;ve seen a lot of weird shit. It comes with the territory, I suppose. But, well, we&#39;ve never had seafood drop from the ceiling. It&#39;s a new thing. So we&#39;re all kind of stumped.&#34;

More scribbling.

&#34;Ah, I see. And then what happened?&#34;

&#34;Well, like I said, no one&#39;s said anything, no one&#39;s moving and then all of a sudden, Dr. Cameron walks in. Diving suit on, snorkel and diving glasses on his head. He says something about miscalculating the alignment on an inter-reality thingamajig, yada yada yada flux calibration thing and how everything&#39;ll be sorted out soon. Then he flops off again, leaving us with a cafeteria full of stingrays and sharks.&#34;

&#34;How did that make you feel?&#34;

&#34;Like calling in sick the next day.&#34;

&#34;Why is that?&#34;

&#34;Cause I don&#39;t like fish, and I was pretty sure we&#39;d be having it for lunch for a few days at least.&#34;

Aeslinger blinked. &#34;Right. Now, Agent Bouchard, are you sure you didn&#39;t leave anything out of your account?&#34;

&#34;Quite.&#34;

&#34;You&#39;re absolutely sure?&#34;

&#34;Positive.&#34;

&#34;Agent Bouchard, do you know why you&#39;re here?&#34;

&#34;Not really. Ferguson called me into his office and told me to report to you.&#34;

&#34;Agent Bouchard, why did you punch that tiger shark you were talking about?&#34;

&#34;I...ehh...&#34;

&#34;Agent Bouchard, I have here some statements signed by several of your colleagues. I will read from one of them.&#34;

Aeslinger shuffled a stack of papers on his desk and seemed to find the one he was looking for.

&#34;Ah, here we are. Now, Agent Fitzroyce states that, and I quote: &#39;Something came over Bouchard. I&#39;ve never seen that look in his eye before, but he just leapt up and charged that thing&#39;,&#34; Aeslinger read. &#34;Now, what would you say to that?&#34;

&#34;I-I really don&#39;t think I did anything anyone else wouldn&#39;t do?&#34; Bouchard answered and squirmed in his chair.

Aeslinger put his pencil down and steepled his hands in front of him.

&#34;Come Agent Bouchard, let&#39;s not beat around the shark-infested bush here: SCP or SPC?&#34;

Daniel sat back and watched the agent&#39;s lips tremble.

&#34;That&#39;s what I thought. Erickson, Winkler, you may escort Agent Bouchard to the temporary holding cells on the fifth floor until we figure out how he managed to transition into this reality construct,&#34; Aeslinger said to the two members of Site-82&#39;s Security Staff that had quietly entered the chambers.

Bouchard stood up and for a split-second seemed to be gearing up for a fight. Then he dropped his head and nodded. Wordlessly he went with his escort.

Aeslinger closed his eyes, thought for a moment and then wrote down a possible solution.

&gt; //Until point of entry for SPC infiltration has been found, put up posters of sharks on concrete walls. Anyone reporting to the site&#39;s medical staff with fractures in their hands is suspicious.//</textarea></pre>
