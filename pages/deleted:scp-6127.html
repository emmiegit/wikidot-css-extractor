**Item #**Scp-6127

**Class** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedure** Scp-6127 is to remain in a 15 yard wide by 15 yard deep by 10 yards tall containment cell populated by low shrubbery and tall grasses. Trees are to be kept sparse and thinly prune. The far Southwestern is to a have a thin 3.5 mm vinyl hose to allow the scent of carrion to be used to lure the Scp away from the entrance located at the Northeast end. 

**Description** Scp-6127 is a medium canid with light grey dense fur starting at the ears and ends 1.5 inches before the withers. The remaining fur is a medium warm mud brown which is darkened near the neck likely due to decaying blood from carrion. Scp-6127 has a skeletal head resembling that of a grey wolf which appears to have been sun bleached. The Scp has similar darkens fur on the head likely caused by its diet of strictly carrion. The skull portion of the Scp has the same discoloration while the remaining fur as well as claws and paw pads remain clean.

Scp-6127 is an unknown anomalous sub species of the grey wolf. Size and coloration have yet to match any current known grey wolf subspecies. It has yet to be seen hunting and shows limited bite force being only strong enough to break apart decaying meat showing little danger to living creatures. It also has not been seen attempting to get more meat from smaller carcasses from the skull cavity. 

Scp-6127 has shown no aggressive behavior to a majority of staff allowed into the containment cell it has shown abnormal behaviors towards members of staff who hunt as a sport or hobby. It attempts to lure staff who part take in hunting towards heavy machinery or pruning equipment. It shows similar behaviorism towards feral cats and dogs. Staff who partake in hunting are not allowed into the containment cell. 

It lacks any form of eyes, tongue, or nose it seems to have abnormally strong sense of hearing and smell while being completely blind. Currently it is unknown how it can smell and eat. Scp-6127 appears to primarily use scent for navigation. 

**Addendum 6127.1**: Scp-6127 was discovered after several abnormal deaths along two separate dirt roads each being car stuck while primarily deer several humans have suffered the same deaths and are not found until an average of 2 months have passed often skeletal remains and clothing. Local myth of Neville in south of Ohio. has similar events starting in early fall of 1968 with the disappearance of 3 hunters. Their remains were found in late march being skeletal remains. The rate of decay was not possible to leave the body in such state. After a woman began seeming to rabble on an online cryptic forums which is now removed. The Scp was spotted on the road stated seeming to consuming carrion of a calf. A moderate tranquilizer was used to sedate the Scp for transport.</textarea></pre>
