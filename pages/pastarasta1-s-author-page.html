[[/div]]

Hi! Welcome to my author page! I&#39;m incredibly happy and excited to be even making this page right now, as I would have never in a million years thought I would have ever been able to create it. 

I am a huge fan of the SCP Universe, and I read a lot of it at a really young age before I even joined the wiki. I am really heavily nostalgic for those days, but it&#39;s not like they&#39;re gone forever or anything!

I absolutely love to draw. It&#39;s something that has helped me throughout many awful times. Drawing is something really awesome cause you can finally draw out all the images that appear in your head. It takes out a lot of anxiety and stress and moves it to your tablet or paper, whatever you use to draw.

I am also obsessed with horror. Horror is something that for some reason has a tighter grasp on me than any other genre in the world. I never felt as much joy as when I read or play or listen to something related to the horror genre. Why? I have no idea. The many ways you can be in danger or be afraid is so interesting to me. I&#39;m always worried about a lot of things, so maybe that&#39;s why? 

Well, we all know why we&#39;re here. Click the other tabs for more information about the stuff I&#39;ve made, as well as extra bonus stuff!

||||~ [[[pastarasta1-s-simply-epic-artpage|what a mess!]]]||
[[/div]]

This page&#39;s history is somewhat of a big mess, I must admit. There are a lot of insane things that happened because of my recklessness. I&#39;m not super proud of the many really stupid things I did during this time. 

From filling up the wiki&#39;s image files with my art, to filling up the page with art to the point where people couldn&#39;t access my page without their phones or computers crashing, it was an incredible mess that I still get embarrassed about.

A lot of people had to help me out during this time, and I feel really bad for the people who had to stare at my old art for hours fixing up the mistakes I made on my page.

My art on this page is very messy, especially in the first few pages. I loved drawing, but I feel that I rushed a lot of the drawings on this page, because I wanted to draw things so badly. I should&#39;ve taken my time with some of the things I drew on here, but then again, I was a very excitable person who wanted to tackle millions of things. 

A lot of people supported me during the time I first began drawing, which, honestly, I am very surprised to this day, and I am forever thankful for.

I ended up drawing 6 things a day. That took a toll on me! It most definitely wasn&#39;t a good idea! I suffered two art crashes during this time, and I took breaks for each of those crashes. You should always take breaks if you crash, I feel.

I do love some of the things I drew on here, but most of it is very messy and if you want to look into my art, I do not recommend starting with this page unless you&#39;re interested in seeing my older work. Also, be warned, some of the SCPs might be outdated since this was probably a year ago or more.

I have a knack for drawing International SCPs that I still sometimes do to this day. International SCPs are all so interesting cause they all come from different perspectives of people, and it&#39;s so interesting to see the SCPs they write. A few International SCPs have become some of my all time favorites! So thank you, INT community, for being awesome.

[[/div]]

This was when I started to slow my roll, I decided instead of 6 a day, I would do only 2 a day. I also made a lot of changes to my art style. I still kept the cartoony stick figure style from my earlier drawings of course, but there are a lot of differences.

Some of these include: 

1. No black outlines on the characters.
2. Thicker limbs.
3. More taking advantage of textures and effects on my program.
4. A better ability to tackle SCPs that I thought I&#39;d never be able to draw.
5. More use of the shape tools that were added to my program.

[https://i.imgur.com/OJO4dG7.png Example.]

Do I think my art is perfect? Of course not. However, I do feel I really improved and it&#39;s made me feel very great.

I very much recommend this page for those interested in my art. Seriously, I had so much fun working on the art for this page, even the stuff I think I could have done better on I still look back on fondly. 

I have taken a break from posting on it indefinitely, but that hasn&#39;t stopped me from drawing art during this time, so I might upload more some day.

Translations: Again, no translations, but the [http://scpfoundation.net/artwork:pastarasta1 Russian branch] did a collection of drawings I did of their SCPs. 

Thanks a bunch! I am a huge fan of -RU SCPs because some of them give me a real &#34;good and classic SCP&#34; feel. Also, Arbelict is an awesome writer and deserves more translations of their work.

||||~ [[[michael-the-kiler|it&#39;s just a story... right?]]]||
[[/div]]

I am honestly incredibly surprised at the amount of people that like this Parawatch article. As of writing this is the most well rated tale of this month, and it was posted during the rating period of the Mystery Contest. 

Parawatch has got to be one of my favorite new GOIs on this site, simply because of the many opportunities it has given to writers on this site. 

Ever since writing this, I&#39;ve wanted to make more creepypasta referencing SCPs/tales. I feel like this is an untapped market. Not like there haven&#39;t been creepypasta referencing SCPs/tales before, though. 

I always wanted to make an established character in the SCP Wiki, and I think michael was a success. I don&#39;t expect it to have a huge fan following or a bunch of stories being made about him any time soon, but I&#39;m really, really happy that I was able to bring this metafictional child ghost to life.

michael is based off, obviously, by Jeff the Killer. The child ghost angle was also inspired by BEN Drowned. I want to do more with this creepypasta theme I gave to michael, so maybe someday I will write another tale about him. I don&#39;t think I could write another Parawatch starring him though, I rather write a creepypasta for my next Parawatch. Perhaps something to do with a video game, I donno.

A few people have said this story has creeped them out. I am very surprised considering the story is a lot more funny to me then it is scary. I did write it with the intent of a mix of horror and humor, but I think I did more humor than horror, personally. 

Thanks so much to everyone who read this. I&#39;m really happy you took the time to read and decide if you liked it or not. It means the absolute world to me.

This is something I had a lot of fun working on. This SCP was a collab with [[*user Westrin]] and [[*user Validclay]]. Both are incredibly amazing to work with, just so you know. This was inspired by cartoons, the dreams and nightmares I had as a child, and the dreams I have nowadays where I&#39;m reading non-existant SCP articles.

This managed to get 64+ in 24 hours without a downvote, which I am honestly really surprised about. I wasn&#39;t expecting this silly thing to be enjoyed by so many people in such a short span of time. I am incredibly happy about that.

I fucking love writing villains.

[[/div]]

This was such fun to make and I am really, really proud of it. This idea didn&#39;t come to me though, instead, it came to [[*user faminepulse]], who was interested in the canon I had been working on in my head for a long while called But A Dream. The premise of which was that the main source of anomalies came from imagination, thought, and belief. 

Needless to say, when Famine told me the idea of a //Eric Zine GOI format//, I was ecstatic! So we both started working on it. Famine did his respective pages and I did mine. It was a ton of fun, probably the best time I have ever had working on something for the site. 

The concept of The Cutout Room was Famine&#39;s idea, it really helped pull things together and it&#39;s just such a fun motif to work with. Famine&#39;s great at these kinds of concepts. 

Not much else to say really. I honestly think this page speaks for itself.

[[/div]]

This one took a really long time to make, I&#39;m talking about a year. I worked on this one with [[*user ValidClay]] and [[*user JackalRelated]] and I had a lot of people help me with it throughout the whole year. 

Fun fact! Apparently, this is the first (at least, successful) SCP ever written with the word &#34;Cartoon&#34; in its title. I don&#39;t know why, that&#39;s just super weird to me.

I am incredibly proud of this SCP, and I am really happy I was able to finish it. It is also the first part of But A Dream (my canon) that I have written in which there is some semblance of world building. It&#39;s little, but it&#39;s there. 

Originally, this was just going to be a Series 1 homage with a testing log full of body horror and a very sad ending. But after a while of discussing w/ ValidClay about the characters, we were able to create something that was much more than what it was originally going to be, and I am forever thankful that we were able to make it that way. 

Thankfully, I doubt it will take me this long to write something again. I was just learning a lot of stuff at the time, and to note, most of the time I was taking breaks from writing. 

I am really happy that this article was successful, and I am really shocked that it managed to reach 150+, as it is probably one of my more personal and experimental works. Thanks so much to everyone who read it!

**Lost Footage Found Episode** is a blog I made a while ago that&#39;s basically about the odd aesthetics of internet horror, and horror in general. It&#39;s slightly personal. The title is a mix of &#34;lost episode&#34; and &#34;found footage&#34;.


It&#39;s a mix of aesthetic posts, posts about horror I love, screenshots from stories, and posts about stuff that I find humorous or odd about the horror from my past and the horror of today. 

It&#39;s basically just a big love letter to horror in general, but the basic theming is creepypasta and the SCP Wiki, as it played a very big part of my life when I was getting into the horror genre. 

This blog was very inspired by blogs such as [https://realfootage.tumblr.com/ realfootage] and [https://scarymario.tumblr.com/ scarymario.] As well as a bit of [https://twitter.com/scp_txt?lang=en scp.txt.]

The offical SCP Wiki blog (as well as some friends) sometimes reblog my aesthetic posts and SCP posts, which is very nice of them, thanks! I appreciate it a lot.

I am planning on doing a lot more with this blog soon, make readings, some art, maybe even make a website. Who knows where I&#39;ll go with this. 

I will make a note, most of the stuff on this blog is not made by me, as this is more of a &#34;stuff i remember and stuff i like&#34; blog. I source art that I post, and I source stories when asked. I&#39;ll also remove posts if people related to the creation of what I&#39;m posting ask.

[[tab Favorite SCPs]]

This is a collection of SCPs I absolutely have fallen in love with. Also some tales. I&#39;ll update this list more and more, because my memory can fail me.

[[[SCP-2747]]] is a SCP that I would say is a perfect blend of lost media horror and meta SCP horror. There&#39;s something so goddamn sinister about the anafabula and I love it so much! I&#39;m surprised the author wasn&#39;t familiar with Killswitch when they wrote it, cause it reminded me of that so much!

[[[SCP-3012]]] is one of my favorite GAW articles on this site. It&#39;s incredibly rich in character, and the anomaly is very enjoyable to me. I recommend. 

[[[SCP-261!]]] An absolute classic! If you haven&#39;t read this yet, what are you doing!? It&#39;s super fun! If you like the concept of alien or anomalous food, this SCP will be right up your ally.  

No wonder [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-280-jp SCP-280-JP] is the most upvoted -JP article on the SCP-JP Wiki. It&#39;s super well done. A concept that seems so simple, yet creative, done in an interesting and awesome way! 

[[[Critter Profile Bakugo|]]] is a really great WWS entry, which, as a GOI, is really fun to me, as I love anomalous animals. This entry was an incredibly enjoyable one! Also, the tapir is cute.

[[[SCP-3896]]] is probably one of the most underrated SCPs I have ever read. I am soooo into everything about this SCP and I&#39;d love to see more art of it someday. I&#39;ll never stop eating Big Gordo. 

[[[SCP-4240]]] is such an awesome love letter to ritual creepypasta. Did I mention how much I&#39;m into ritual stories in the first place? Especially ones about going into different dimensions or summoning creatures. This SCP does a great job at replicating the feeling of reading one, while adding a little twist to the mix.

[[[SCP-3335]]] is just super crazy. I&#39;ve always been a fan of anomalous drugs that do weird things to peoples bodies, and this was no different. Some of the body horror in this feels so simple yet so wrong and nasty. I super recommend for people who like rlly gross horror.

[[/tab]]

[[tab Favorite Creepypastas]]

Heyo! Creepypasta! I won&#39;t really explain into too much detail why I chose these, as I think the fun part of reading Creepypasta is not knowing what it&#39;s about at first! Instead, I will just put a quote from the creepypasta on each of these. This will also be updated, of course. Memory always fails me.
