    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-7964

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7964 is to be contained within a standard animal containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber must be soundproofed and equipped with a white noise generator to prevent SCP-7964 from using its anomalous ability. The chamber must also be cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis by trained animal handlers.

SCP-7964 must be fed a diet of standard dog food and given access to fresh water at all times. SCP-7964 is to be taken for walks daily by at least one trained animal handler, who must wear earplugs and protective gear in case SCP-7964 uses its anomalous ability.

**Description:** SCP-7964 is a male Golden Retriever with supersonic barks. SCP-7964&#39;s barks are capable of producing sound waves with a frequency of up to 200,000 Hz, which can cause physical harm to living beings and structures. SCP-7964&#39;s barks can also disrupt electronic devices and cause interference with radio and television signals.

SCP-7964 was discovered in a suburban neighborhood in ████████, where it had caused significant damage to nearby homes and buildings with its barks. Foundation agents were able to capture SCP-7964 and bring it into containment.

**Addendum:** Due to the potential danger posed by SCP-7964&#39;s anomalous ability, it has been designated as a Euclid-class anomaly. Efforts are being made to train SCP-7964 to control its barks and prevent harm to living beings and structures.</textarea></pre>
