**Item #:** SCP-7206

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7206’s remains have been disposed of through a Foundation waste treatment facility.

**Description:** SCP-7206 is a humanoid reality bender, residing in [REDACTED], United States.

SCP-7206 is capable of transmuting any living being they --directly-- perceive[[footnote]]See Recovery Log[[/footnote]] into almost any mundane material or object desired. SCP-7206 has shown to only be capable of creating items equal to, or smaller than the subject’s original size. Only items produced using SCP-7206’s abilities can be returned to their original state, despite being comparatively smaller.

**Discovery Log:** SCP-7206 displayed no anomalous properties until three months before discovery. It is believed that SCP-7206’s anomalous properties manifested recently, having previously remained dormant. Anomalous activity was not immediately noticed, as SCP-7206 would use their abilities sparingly.

SCP-7206&#39;s usage of their abilities occur irregularly, based solely on the needs or whims of SCP-7206 at the time. SCP-7206 has expressed neither distress nor concern towards their new abilities, utilizing them freely on civilians whenever they see fit. Further examination is needed to determine SCP-7206&#39;s exact personality file, although sociopathic tendencies are evident.

**Incident Log:** The following is a list of noticeable incidents involving SCP-7206 prior to containment. All footage was recovered from surveillance cameras located in [REDACTED].

&gt; //SCP-7206 waits in-line at a bus stop. The bus arrives, and SCP-7206 steps on.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Bus driver:** Two-fifty, pal.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-7206 reaches around in their pockets for several seconds, expressing frustration.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7206:** Oh for god’s sake. Hang on a sec.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-7206 turns around and looks at the civilian behind them. The person is transmuted into a dollar coin, which SCP-7206 catches in their hand.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7206:** Wait, not enough.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-7206 looks to the remaining civilians in line, who all stare in shock. Subjects have little time to react before being transmuted into individual coins. SCP-7206 mutters &#34;Wait, no.&#34; and &#34;Only one?&#34; to themselves as they do. SCP-7206 counts the coins before handing them to the bus driver, who stares in disbelief.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7206:** Here you go. $2.75, right?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-7206 hands the coins to the driver, $3.00 in total. SCP-7206 steps onto the bus and takes a seat. The bus pulls away three minutes later. The driver quietly sobs throughout the entirety of the drive.//

&gt; //SCP-7206 walks through a local park while eating an ice cream cone, which they accidentally drop.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7206:** Aww, damn it.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-7206 looks around, noticing a woman and a young boy, the latter of which is licking his own ice cream cone. SCP-7206 approaches the two. The boy is transmuted into an ice-cream cone identical to that which SCP-7206 dropped. SCP-7206 catches the cone, and begins eating it as they walk away. The woman approaches SCP-7206, visibly distraught.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Woman:** What- What did- What did you just do!? What did you do- Where is he!? WHERE IS HE!? What have you done!?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-7206 looks back at the woman, continuing to lick the ice cream cone. The woman stares directly at the cone, physically gagging as her face turns even redder.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Woman:** Give him- Change him back!
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-7206 stares at the woman as they bite a large chunk out of the ice cream cone.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7206:** What?
&gt; 
&gt; **Woman:** CHANGE HIM BACK!
&gt; 
&gt; //The woman reaches inside her bag.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7206:** Ok! Jeez…
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-7206 causally tosses the ice cream cone onto the tarmac path. A second later, the young boy is restored. The woman immediately reaches down and embraces him, hugging him tightly and shaking. SCP-7206 walks off, before transmuting a nearby pigeon into another ice cream cone which they begin eating.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** Medical examination revealed a noticeable decrease in the child’s brain matter and neural activity following the event.

&gt; //SCP-7206 walks up to a homeless woman taking shelter under a bridge. SCP-7206 smiles, before handing over three pizza boxes to her. The woman looks up at him, clearly set aback, but smiling.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Homeless woman:** Wow. I… Are you for real?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-7206 looks at her, smiles back, pulls out his phone, and takes a picture of them together. The woman is then transmuted into a cardboard pizza box identical to the other three, and SCP-7206 places it on top of the pile. SCP-7206 walks away.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** Later investigations revealed that seven homeless people had been reported missing throughout the area.
 
&gt; //SCP-7206 approaches a bench and sits down. A man sits beside him, reading a newspaper. SCP-7206 looks around and sighs to themselves while fidgeting. After a few minutes, SCP-7206 turns and notices the man. The man transmutes into a soap bubble. SCP-7206 stares at the bubble floating around for a minute, before sighing again and walking away. The bubble floats towards a teenage boy, who pops it and smiles. The boy then reaches the bench and notices the fallen newspaper. He looks around.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Teenage boy:** Dad?

**Recovery Log:** MTF Lambda-5 (“White Rabbits”) were appointed for the recovery mission of SCP-7206. It was concluded that the best course of action would be to approach SCP-7206 stealthily, subdue them, and restrain the subject while unconscious. Use of excessive force was permitted if necessary.

A Scranton Reality Anchor was placed within range of SCP-7206&#39;s apartment. On location personnel watching via agent&#39;s body-cam&#39;s would be instructed to activate the device upon indication of SCP-7206 becoming hostile. Agents were equipped with compact Realty Harnesses.

The incident was recorded as follows:
&gt; //Agents unlock the door to SCP-7206&#39;s apartment and quietly enter. SCP-7206 lies alone on a sofa, watching a large television set. Empty wrappers and snack foods litter the carpeted floor. An agent steps on a piece of food, alerting SCP-7206. SCP-7206 turns around and jumps up, glaring at the agents.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7206:** Who are!? You pieces of-
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-7206 vanishes.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Post-incident Report:** The exact reason for SCP-7206&#39;s transfiguration of itself is unknown. It has been speculated that the reality harnesses prevented SCP-7206&#39;s abilities to alter any of the agents, instead defaulting to the sole remaining feasible target, SCP-7206 themselves. Another conclusion suggests that SCP-7206 perceived their own reflection on the vizor of one of the agents, causing them to unwittingly think of themselves while choosing a target.
&gt; 
&gt; The fecal matter resulting from the transfiguration was collected and later disposed of.</textarea></pre>
