**Item #:** SCP-4022

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4022 is contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-███. SCP-4022 is not to be permitted access to psychiatric care. Personnel are not permitted to discuss the mental state of SCP-4022, verbally or otherwise. 

**Description:** SCP-4022 is a 60-year-old Asian-American man, formerly known as ███ ████. SCP-4022 exhibits symptoms of severe dementia. Further information about SCP-4022 should not be provided to individuals without 4-4022 clearance.

**Recovery:** SCP-4022 was recovered after an incident at ███ █████████  Hospital in ███ █████████, California, during which a doctor fell comatose after composing a psychological report about SCP-4022. Three more doctors fell comatose before Foundation operatives were able to intercept and recover SCP-4022.

&gt; ++ INFOHAZARD WARNING
&gt; 
&gt; Further information about SCP-4022 is restricted to personnel who have received the appropriate battery of memetic inoculations. There&#39;s a great big nothing in the middle of his head. By continuing to read this page, you are agreeing to submit to psychological screenings under the SAFEGUARD protocol. Any personnel reporting decreases in pattern recognition are to report to on-site counseling staff. 
&gt; 
There&#39;s a great big nothing in the middle of his head. Any description of the great big nothing in the middle of his head that does not refer to it exclusively as such is a Class III infohazard. 

When an individual is made aware of the great big nothing in the middle of his head by any means that does not use the acceptable designation, that individual becomes a host of the great big nothing in the middle of his head. Symptoms of the great big nothing in the middle of his head progress as follows.

* **Stage 1:** Affected subjects experience a marked decrease in pattern recognition.
* **Stage 2:** Affected subjects experience a marked decrease in ability to perceive patterns, even when they are not recognized as such. Ordered sequences of numbers, letters, shapes, or colors have been described as &#34;blurry&#34; and &#34;translucent&#34;. These effects appear to be mitigated when the patterns are in motion, or when the patterns make reference to the great big nothing in the middle of his head.
* **Stage 3:** Affected subjects lose all ability to recognize, construct, or perceive patterns, including ones that make reference to the great big nothing in the middle of his head. Affected subjects lose the ability to speak coherently, read, and write. Motion is significantly inhibited. 
* **Stage 4:** Affected subjects enter a comatose state before expiring shortly after. 

Neurological imaging of affected subjects reveals a great big nothing in the middle of his head. Images of the brains of all subjects, including SCP-4022, are considered Class III cognitohazards --and are only to be handled by SAFEGUARD&#39;s on-site digital imaging software--.

It is theorized that the great big nothing in the middle of his head is a Class II antimemetic infohazard capable of residing within and consuming human consciousnesses. SCP-4022&#39;s resistance to its effects is thought to be caused by its dementia, which prevents it from forming coherent patterns of speech or thought. It is also theorized that referring to the great big nothing in the middle of his head as such prevents it from being understood by the speaker as a formally extant entity, thereby mitigating its cognitohazardous effects. The convention of referring to the great big nothing in the middle of his head as such has been standardized to prevent accidental contamination.

**SAFEGUARD Report 4022-40**
Analysis of images: SAFEGUARD&#39;s on-site digital imaging software was deployed to analyze and interpret a brain scan of a person suffering from Stage 4 of the great big nothing in the middle of his head.

&gt; **Image:** {{DIGITAL SCAN - AFFECTED SUBJECT}}
&gt; Subject&#39;s brain exhibits {{FRONTAL LOBE DECAY (83%)}} of an {{ADVANCED}} nature. Subject&#39;s brain exhibits {{OCCIPITAL LOBE DECAY (67%)}} of an {{ADVANCED}} nature. Subject&#39;s brain exhibits {{TEMPORAL LOBE DECAY (70%)}} of an {{ADVANCED}} nature. Subject&#39;s brain exhibits a {{GREAT BIG NOTHING (NaN%)}} of an {{UNDEFINED}} nature. Subject&#39;s brain exhibits a {{GREAT BIG NOTHING (NaN%)}} between the {{FRONTAL}} and {{OCCIPITAL}} lobes. There&#39;s a {{GREAT BIG NOTHING}} in the {{MIDDLE}} of his {{HEAD}}.

Analysis of SAFEGUARD&#39;s digital imaging software revealed across-the-board processing delays within SAFEGUARD&#39;s software. SAFEGUARD has been taken offline indefinitely and replaced with a backup. No further testing is scheduled at this time.
