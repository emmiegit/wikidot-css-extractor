**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7850 is kept within a low-maintenance enclosure fitted with hidden cameras for the purpose of observing the object. Civilians are to be directed away from the enclosure as per standard procedure. 

Local civilian equipment previously capable of receiving SCP-7850&#39;s transmissions have been adjusted properly under the guise of FCC regulations. 

**Description:** SCP-7850 is a slightly damaged Sharp Color TV Model originally discovered in the Coconino National Forest, Arizona. Humans within a 10 meter radius of SCP-7850 experience a mental compulsion to avoid harming or manipulating the object, with the intensity of the compulsion growing the closer they are to the object. Non-humans seem to be immune to this compulsion, with animals of the //Felidae// family appearing to be inversely affected by it.

Periodically, an adult house cat, designated SCP-7850-B, will manifest nearby SCP-7850. When aware of humans physically observing it, SCP-7850-B displays no unusual behavior and interacts with others amicably. When SCP-7850-B believes that it is unobserved, it will proceed to SCP-7850 and vocalize loudly, causing the object&#39;s screen to open as if it were a door.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Researchers have been unable to recreate this, even with trained domestic House Cats [[/span]] SCP-7850-B will then enter the object and lay down, causing the screen to close. SCP-7850-B will typically remain inside for 4-8 hours before exiting it and demanifesting. While they are inside, SCP-7850 will broadcast up to 7 messages encoded in binary.  If at any point SCP-7850-B becomes aware of it being observed during this process, it will immediately demanifest and broadcasts will cease.

**Discovery:** During an otherwise non-anomalous meteor shower, Arizona residents living near the Coconino Forest reported a small unidentified object crashing within the forest; the Foundation was made aware of this after a resident filmed themself holding SCP-7850-B and commenting on the anomalous compulsion created by SCP-7850. 

**Addendum 7850.1:** SCP-7850 Broadcast Archive

 Notable SCP-7850 broadcasts are filed below. Line separations denote that the broadcasts occurred on a different manifestation of SCP-7850-B.

**Note:** After this transmission, SCP-7850-B has been seen carrying wires or other miscellaneous items in its mouth, before taking them into SCP-7850.

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
GOD DAMNIT. MAY THE FILTH CURSE YOU ALL. I USED THE WRONG ONE AND NOW I HAVE TO GET MORE. I HATE THIS REALM. 
[[/div]]


**Addendum 7850.2:** Incident 7850 ALPHA 

During an observed SCP-7850-B and SCP-7850 interaction, a coyote wandered into viewing range of its enclosure. Before personnel could remove the animal, SCP-7850-B exited the object and upon noticing the coyote, hissed and immediately retreated back into SCP-7850. SCP-7850 then transmitted the following messages: 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
I WAS WRONG I SEE NOW THAT THE FILTH HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO SPREAD UPON THIS REALM AND BLIGHT THE HIGHER FELINES OF IT. 
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
UNTOLD HELLS SCOURGE THESE LANDS, I MUST EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY. 
[[/div]]

Afterward, SCP-7850 made a loud, violent mechanical noise before beginning to lift upward. The object began radiating an immense amount of Gamma Radiation as cameras recorded a metallic aperture protruding from the bottom of it. SCP-7850 then launched upward at approximately 25km/s, entering the atmosphere in 11 seconds before it demanifested.

[[include component:image-block

]]

Moments before demanifesting SCP-7850 broadcasted the following message:
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
MAY YOUR WOES BE MANY, AND YOUR DOG DAYS FEW. 
[[/div]]

No further activity nor sightings connected to SCP-7850 have been reported since this incident. Anomaly is pending reclassification.
