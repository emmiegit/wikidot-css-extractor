++++ [[size 120%]]//Do you ever see the scribbles in book margins? I know I have. They&#39;re usually either the normal notation time, or someone playing around. Leaving silly goose chases through the book. But it isn&#39;t so simple. I&#39;ve seen them, cryptic scribbles of a certain hand. It&#39;s looping,coarse, and distinct. I know he wants to be seen. Even when they tell me I&#39;m nuts, I know better. His hand is steady, and he wants to be found. Well, he&#39;s got it.//[[/size]]
= ^^- A journal found behind a red almanac.^^

++++ [[size 120%]]//These instructions are some of the weirdest I&#39;ve seen yet. But, I did follow them, and once again they bore fruit. A big, red romance novel had more instructions in it. I think I&#39;m getting closer to them, the ink looked fresher than usual.//[[/size]]

++++ [[size 120%]] //Hah! I know I&#39;m catching up to him! The ink was still wet this time, and it had drips. That means he must have been in a hurry, unless he&#39;s toying with me, but he isn&#39;t toying with me because I am the one doing the toying. I&#39;m gonna get him. Just gotta be patient.//[[/size]]

[[=]]
++++ [[size 120%]] //I did it. They&#39;re looking for me now, but I didn&#39;t get grabbed. I stole... robbed someone of a book they were giving away. I didn&#39;t know the best way to make it theft, so I knocked her down first. That seemed to work, especially when her dad saw me grabbing it he called me a thief. From then, I knew everything was going to work out.//[[/size]]

++++ [[size 120%]] //This is proof I&#39;m onto something. I found a book I&#39;d read when I was ten, some penny dreadful about Ronnie Ray Gun, and found something telling me to go to an appendix. My appendix, specifically. Since I don&#39;t have any books in my name, I&#39;ll have to look harder.//[[/size]]

&gt; These journals were recovered from the home of &#34;Alan Boyle&#34;, a late regular library patron who had been noted as having particularly obsessive habits. When his belongings were searched, several hundred texts were found stashed in and around his home. Each one had some sort of marginal note. None of the notes described in his journals have been found.</textarea></pre>
