After an exhausting day of janitor work in the local research institute, Harry collapses onto his bed. No need to change out of his musty grey uniform; no need to eat. Just to sleep. To finish yet another unbearable day. His bed groans in protest of being in use for 18 years, and Harry does the same in protest of the past thirty-six. As the odour of mildew and rotting Cheezels pervade Harry&#39;s senses, he drifts off to sleep, preparing for the most bearable hours of his day. Closing his eyes and his mind, sleep quickly takes him...

Every part of this was telling Harry it was some ill-humoured prank, except for the researcher&#39;s tone. He&#39;s never heard a whitecoat this desperate before. He decides to entertain the idea that this is serious, however bizarre. He comes to his feet and staggers in the general direction of the answering machine. He reaches the table, hitting his shin on the table leg. Harry responds with rather unpleasant noises. He squints through his blurred vision to make out the phone number. He types out the number at an agonising snail&#39;s pace. Oh... five... two... seve- nope, mistyped. Clear. Oh... five...

Harry continued on like this for exactly one minute and 47 seconds.
Eventually, his nervous system obeys.

Full of caffeine and vigour, Harry storms through the dark towards the bus stop. When the bus arrives, he channels his hyperactivity into tapping his card, then sits down on the garishly designed seat. Harry has too little energy to contemplate the events to come, but too much to sit still. Harry notices the number of street signs outside, the dent on the grab handles, the mass of gum under his seat, but fails to notice the only other passenger on the bus, who looks on from the back seat behind his opaque sunglasses. As the bus&#39; doors open, Harry bursts from his seat as though released from restraints. After counting thirty seconds in his head, the agent pulls a Foundation-made phone from his pocket and taps in the ID of the MTF captain.
