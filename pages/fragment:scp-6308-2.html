**Item #:** SCP-6308

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Mobile Task Force Alpha-25 “Rhodes’ Impi” is deployed to a site approximately 1 km away from SCP-6308, with its entrance to be buried by directional blasting and declared abandoned due to mining accidents. Since 19██, SCP-6308 has not been of further concern to society; its equity shall remain under the control of a Foundation-funded mining company, and it is considered that no further physical internment measures are necessary.

A permanent research station is established within SCP-6308, and supplies for the stationed personnel are to be delivered via the underground railway at regular intervals, where appropriate, from the site where MTF Alpha-25 is located. The stationed personnel&#39;s roles are to monitor fixed elevations, report regularly on the presence of identifiable moving objects, and carry out daily realistic stability measurements to ensure that SCP-6308 remains relatively inert for the expected --10--20 years.

**Description:** SCP-6308 is a space-time anomaly located within an abandoned silver mine in ████████ region of the Republic of Zimbabwe. ##red| The anomaly is isomorphic to Rhodes in the Aegean region of the current time stream and should be considered as a representation of “Rhodes”. ##Upon exploration of the mine, it is determined that objects, after a continuous lowering and crossing of a specific altitude inside the mine, are subject to spatial and temporal perturbations, losing their radiometric signature. At this point, the object is considered to have entered the &#34;interior&#34; of SCP-6308, which will reach the unburied entrance to the mine upon re-elevating.

Existing observations indicate the existence of --humanoid-- ##red| human## activities &#34;within&#34; SCP-6308; ##red| most of the population exhibit similar characteristics to the Greeks of classical antiquity in the current time stream in terms of culture, daily life, etc.## After further interviews by agents, it was obtained that a majority of --humanoid individuals-- ##red| humans## in the local population, later categorised as SCP-6308-1, were administered by a regime known as “British Rhodesia”. The technology used by local humanoids resembles roughly that of the Bronze Age, but further information suggests that large steam machinery was put into production before the colony was established; the possibility of interference from civilizations across the time stream can largely be excluded. ##red| The aforementioned “anomalies” were also used in Greece in classical antiquity of the current time stream for specific sites. The previous examination of this proved to have been misdirected by anti-memetic effects. They are no longer categorised as “anomalies”. ##

According to known information on “British Rhodesia”, the regime is governed by the &#34;British Government&#34;, which resembles the regime of Great Britain in the latter 19th century in all respects; The &#34;British Government&#34; exerts complete control over the administrative, financial, and legislative powers of British Rhodesia and governs it directly through an appointed viceroy. --As the existing information does not reveal knowledge about the family and social origins of the viceroy, any proposals for sending agents to replace the incumbent viceroy would be rejected.-- ##red| The Mobile Task Force has successfully conducted several operations and intercepted convoys travelling through time streams, and the viceroy has now been replaced by an Agent (identification code ██████). The ruling duties of the viceroy are to be performed in a normal manner. ##

It is evidenced by the interviews with officials in “British Rhodesia” that the time stream of the “British Government” to which the officials belong is 98.78% similar to the time stream in which the Foundation is located. With the exploration of natural disciplines, the “British Government” was able to successfully span different time streams through currently unknown technology, allowing for the establishment of colonial authorities at different time periods. --The information available so far does not contain sufficient evidence for the categorisation of local humanoid individuals as Homo sapiens. Further examination on perceptions of racial order is required to apprehend the interference of inter-stream civilisations on the formation of local racial ethics.--

##red| During interactions with colonial officials, it was clear that the said individuals had knowledge of ancient Greek and Roman history and would use classical allusions in their expressions; none of the above knowledge, however, led the individuals to make adequate connections between ancient Greece in their time stream and SCP-6308. Association cues with captured administrators at the Foundation&#39;s sites were unsuccessful and are inferred to be influenced by a potential anti-meme, the degree of which is being evaluated currently.##

--Humanoid-- ##red|Human## economic activity in SCP-6308 is dominated by traditional agriculture. With the introduction of the British management paradigms, more cash crops (e. g. cotton and coffee) were promoted in the agricultural structure; this, however, resulted in a local food crisis that lasted 9 months. Meanwhile, the production of indigenous handicrafts (apart from local sculptures) almost completely disappeared with the introduction of British cloth and wares; the production of indigenous sculptures remained relatively intact due to the preferences of the native British population. The native humanoids redeveloped artistic forms that bore little resemblance to their traditional, colourful, and varied sculptures as the British transformed and expanded the colonial economy. --No further opinions of native humanoids on this situation are currently available.-- ##red|The general increase in land taxation and the negative consequences caused by the lack of food caused widespread riots and unrest in Rhodesia for some time, and there is evidence that the “chief culprits” were punished by hard labour in the nearby silver mines.##

--“British Rhodesia” is not located in Rhodesia (present-day Zambia and Zimbabwe) as perceived by the Foundation; given the sunny and arid climate in SCP-6308, it is more likely that SCP-6308 is on the west coast of a continent. Also contrary to current knowledge, the capital of &#34;British Rhodesia&#34; is located on an island close to the continent. It was said during interviews that the island serves as the administrative centre and transport hub of the &#34;Rhodesian&#34; region.--

--After acquiring the island, “The British Rhodesia Company”, the predecessor of the “British Rhodesian Colony”, successfully intervened in local affairs. However, the “Rhodesian Company” suffered from many long-established malpractices and was disestablished by the colonial authorities after a major “Rhodesian” Rebellion.--

##red| **“British Rhodesia” was the name given by the “British Authority” to the Greek region that was still in classical antiquity.--** ##

##red| According to the Foundation&#39;s research, the history of “British Rhodesia” began with the Hippocratic War in SCP-6308. As Cecil Rhodes attempted to establish trade and settlements on an unexplored island in the eastern Aegean, the Greek region was officially named “Rhodesia”, after its founder, Cecil Rhodes; the island served as the administrative centre of “British Rhodesia” and was named “Rhodes”. ##

##red| Following the beginning of the disastrous Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta, the authorities of the “British Rhodesia Company” quickly took military action to expand their influence into the Achaea region and installed a tyrannical regime in Athens to further control this city-state. The failure to fully annex the “Rhodesian” region is presumed to stem from the failure of British colonial activity in other time streams, resulting in difficulties in controlling the region. ##

##red| The “British Rhodesia Company’s” military and political dependence on the “Rhodesian” natives, along with the growth of Athenian tyranny, contributed to the major “Rhodesian Rebellion”. The immediate cause of the rebellion is not yet known. The “British Rhodesia Company” was disestablished after the war, and Rhodesia was brought under direct control of the “British Authority”. ##

**Addendum-1:** A discussion on Naturalism in the early colonial stage of British Rhodesia that examined and classified the presence of humanoid activity in SCP-6308.

&gt; As you have already mentioned… my brethren who dedicate themselves to taxonomy are working all across the empire presently. Speerman is sailing for the Cape of Good Hope, whilst Thunberg is following a viceroy to the new colony of Niphon. Both of them are, certainly, very competent naturalists; and I earnestly hope that I will soon receive news of their explorations in this virgin land. 
&gt;
&gt; Some of my other friends may be less so inclined to taxonomy, but be it Persia, Tartary, or Mexico, their miraculous works in Botany nevertheless encourage my exploration in Rhodesia as well. Here, too, I might be able to edit my discoveries, as Roland did in Suriname and Karl in Arabia, and thus find my place in the Society. Despite the discouraging news that the species in Rhodesia seem no different from those in Macedonia, I remain resolute, for how can one achieve anything, if he follows always the advice of amateurs? 
&gt;
&gt; Hear me – in this place, gold intermingles with clay and stone; in this place, violets inhabit the oak woods. Perhaps the combinations themselves are meaningless, yet, the Laws of Nature extracted from these assemblages are what separates us from those who have yet to understand these secrets… The crux of these secrets hides itself precisely within these Laws. It is with these laws that Theseus broke out, by relying on the threads of Ariadne, from the labyrinth that held the Minotaur; In Rhodesia, it seems, there are also tales of such carnivorous beasts as well, a glimpse of which will suffice to bring me fame.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, I shall sail for Rhodesia, in hopes of something in return. At any rate, our noble cause is providing bread, clothes, chance, and gold for our great nation. Rhodesia has already set the table; ought we to be as foolish as Mr. Clive of India, only to lament later how little we have tasted?

&gt; Good day! … It must be said that our explorations here have almost come to a halt. If it were a wilderness, it would have been fine, but what a splendid place Rhodesia happens to be! The plains and valleys are filled with beautiful meadows, and the beauty of nature attracts the eye. How happy I would have been to have settled here with its beautiful trees and flowers, instead of rainy Essex. But such a wonderfully diverse world, so richly endowed with nature, has denied me the opportunity: the local flora and fauna are only slightly different from what we saw in the old world, it seems?
&gt;
&gt; Although I have been here for a long time, I still have illusions about the biological and geographical value of this land. Late last night, we stayed at the aforementioned coachman&#39;s barnyard. The farm is situated on the opposite bank of a long river, bordered at regular intervals by undulating hills, in some of which caves and grottoes are visible. Have these caves existed //ab immemorabili//? Or have they been created by the ups and downs that no natural thing may escape?
&gt;
&gt; I hope that I will bring back good news when I next write.

&gt; Exploration of the caves and grottoes was equally in vain, and my knowledge of naturalism yielded nothing in identifying the general texture of the local stalactites and granite. It should not be said that the geology of the area was not worth investigating; however, I could not obtain the needed intelligence. But even under these circumstances I still achieved something, the welcome news I had been hoping for; Perhaps, the greatest oversight was that I had overlooked the most important matter. Von Linné and his writings guided us in classifying //Homo Sapiens// into six categories:
&gt; # […] //Ferus//. Tetrapus, mutus, hirsutus.
&gt; # […] //Americanus//. Rusus, Cholericus, rectus. _
&gt; Pillis nigris, rectis, crassis; Naribus patulis; Facie ephelitica, Mento subimberbi. _
&gt; Pertinax, hilaris, liber. _
&gt; Pingit se lineis daedaleis rubris. _
&gt; Regitur Consvetudine. 
&gt; # […] //Europoeus//. albus, fanguineus, torofus. _
&gt; Pilis slavescentibus prolixis. Oculis caeruleis. _
&gt; Levis, acutissimus, inventor. _
&gt; Tegitur Vestimentis arctis. _
&gt; Regitur Ritibus. 
&gt; # […] //Asiaticus//. Luridus, melancholicus, rigidus. _
&gt; Pilis nigricantibus. Oculis suscis. _
&gt; Severus. sastuosus, avarus. _
&gt; Tegitur Indumentis laxis. _
&gt; Regitur Opinionibus. 
&gt; # […] //Afer//. niger, phlegmaticus, laxus. _
&gt; Pilis atris, contortuplicatis. Cute holosericea. Naso simo. Labiis tumidis. Feminis sinus pudoris ; Mammoe lactantes prolixae. _
&gt; Vafer, segnis, negligens. _
&gt; Ungit se pingui. _
&gt; Regitur Arbitrio.
&gt; There is, of course, another category, //Homo sapiens monstrosus//. The two-headed giants that they discovered, according to information in Patagonia, are an example of this. So, into which category of people should the Rhodesians be classified? It is impossible to identify Rhodesia geographically by its topography; we can only trace the clues. The dark-haired Rhodesians, as mentioned, must have been //Homo sapiens asiaticus//, but unlike what we have seen before, they exhibit astonishing creativity in their rudimentary machinery, and their script, though vulgar, is also purported to have had its own mythology and philosophy – totally unheard of!
&gt; 
&gt; As such, living with these people in Rhodesia gives us a perspective we&#39;ve never seen before... Do you know how these Rhodesians made their cream? They made a bag of sorts out of a piece of wild animal skin that they sewed together to replace our blenders, poured the milk into this bag, tied it tightly, and shaken the milk from each end until it became cream; however, due to the poor output of this method, they don&#39;t eat much of the cream, instead smearing most of it on their bodies, selling the rest to us. In all seriousness, I am trying to get in on the act and join their production. Should I succeed, it will be of great benefit to our research in ethnography; the Rhodesians, at the same time, will also be raised as the new //Homo sapiens rhodiensis//.

**Addendum-2:**
&gt; I have heard that the events in Jamaica, where the Hon. Governor Edward Eyre – who took decisive steps to save Jamaica from crisis, at the expense of only a few hundred rebellious slaves – has been charged with murder. The so-called “Jamaica Committee” – the Mills and Huxleys – was utterly foolish: in a country with a small military presence and countless indignant peasants, would not decisive and swift measures be the only way to ensure order?  Was it not in keeping with the principle of the “pursuit of the greatest utility” that the newly freed slaves of Jamaica must be exposed to such serious yet direct punishment to avoid the contagion of the crisis throughout the island and the further suffering and misery it would cause?
&gt; 
&gt; How can gentlemen who fancy themselves “Liberals” be so sentimental as to sacrifice Britain&#39;s Imperial Responsibilities simply because they “want to please the negros”! Consider the possibility of a similar situation in British Rhodesia, where the Rhodesian rebellion of yesteryear still reminds us that we must not be lacking in enthusiasm and decisiveness in times of crisis. May as well let these committee members blow the trumpet and let out the fierce dogs! If our humanitarianism must shine anywhere, it should be more for the “white slaves” in the factories on British soil, those who have recently gathered in Hyde Park, rather than the coloured races of Jamaica and Rhodesia. (The author hesitates to leave a slight scribble in Rhodesia.) Moreover, what would be the benefit of freeing these slaves? The actions of the freed slaves in both Jamaica and Rhodesia prove that even such a small wound can be deeply wounding in return for a grudge. All this seems to lead to the conclusion that the colonies should not enjoy the precious gift of freedom.
&gt; 
&gt; Nevertheless, I remain a liberal – a proud one. I know that it is only pure and clear reason that can be called a true agent of Progress, and I believe that one of the greatest dangers the state can face is to propose the dismantling of the existing order and the transfer of power from the affluent and sensible to those who are, inevitably, striving every day simply to survive. If lands such as Rhodesia could not be transformed from depressing lands of brutal wars, dreadful superstitions, destructive pestilence, and famine to a utopia of order, peace and industriousness, their plea for autonomy will fail. To link the colonies together in so many ties of perfect freedom, of perfect self-government – as the noble Greeks did – should not be a delusion; yet, considering the present condition of the colonies, which even England has not yet been able to attain, we can only bear the burden for the moment, and turn – as the Romans did – to promote the Rule of Law and the structure of a truly civilised society in all space and in all time.

The analysis shows that France had an important role in the importation of machinery into “Rhodesia” and had a deep relationship with the local regime prior to the “Rhodesian” Rebellion.

**Appendix-4:**
&gt; To “isolate”[[footnote]]A reference to the “isolation policy” of the “Rhodesian” authorities, which excluded the native “Rhodesian” population from colonial bureaucracy.[[/footnote]] the Rhodesians would not strengthen our Empire; rather, it would lead to poor judgement, ignorance, and rashness in legislation, which would deepen civil discontent. As Britannia operates under a party cabinet system, there are often sudden changes in Rhodesian affairs that, naturally, result in increased administrative costs. Isolation, too, naturally, as its name implies, excluded the most learned, moderate, and influential native classes from the administration and prevented them from assuming responsibility for the welfare of the natives, which naturally impoverished the nation and made the Empire weak and ineffectual.
&gt; 
&gt; I have already described in my book the deeds of the most brilliant Viceroys and Governors who, in the past, did everything possible at the time to promote the welfare of the subjects through cooperation with the Rhodesians. It is now imperative that their policy be continued and developed rather than further despotism and the maintenance of non-confidence, and this is a matter which requires the cooperation of we Rhodesians. The British rulers now know far less about Rhodesia than their predecessors did fifty years ago, so it is now up to them to abandon their foolish policy of “Isolation” and turn Rhodesians into like-minded people, people who work together, and to make the mostly ignorant Rhodesians responsible for good governance. In all civilised countries, it is unthinkable to manage well without communicating with the majority of the population, and in Rhodesia, this is more important than in any civilised country.
&gt; 
&gt; At the dawn of the new century, Rhodesia saw more suffering and discontent than at any other time in its history, even beyond the Tyranny. The epidemic was accompanied by famine, and the vast expanse of the disaster area was unprecedented, leaving the entirety of the Dominion in desolation. Even most of the people in the non-affected areas were in skeletal shapes, indicating a lack of food and a state of semi-starvation. In this time of crisis, the disputes of Rhodesia&#39;s native parties had ceased, and now every experienced British and Rhodesian – loyal to the British Empire – knew it was their duty to propose a way out of the most serious danger that had ever threatened British Rhodesia.
&gt; 
&gt; We Rhodesians don&#39;t demand much... Everything happening in Rhodesia has shown that the natives don&#39;t like sudden changes or revolutions. So far, they have not asked the councillors for a new constitution but are happy to work along the established routes. In other words, all expectations of further reform are in fact directed towards strengthening the existing government and making it more accessible to the people. They wanted some Rhodesian councillors on the Council of the Secretary of State for Rhodesia and on the Viceroy&#39;s Executive Council, so that the interests of the olive oil production and the fishery could be represented by the Rhodesians and, where possible, to cooperate in administrative matters as an “integral part of the Empire”.
&gt; 
&gt; It would be trivial to continue to ignore such demands, to treat the aforementioned educated and influential sections of the Rhodesian population with indifference, to increase discontent in the country, and to continue to impose despotic rule to weaken the Empire. Yet, we have the far more brilliant option of bringing the emerging forces around the government, and it would be just as trivial to involve these educated Rhodesians in the administration of a government that could adequately represent the interests of the local agricultural and fishing industries and take on the task of improving the material well-being of the people, saving them from disasters. Here again, we conclude with the words of John Mill: “It is naturally improper and unprofitable in the nature of things on earth to bind up another man&#39;s hands to protect his interests, however sincere the intention may be.” Only with their own hands can they make all positive and lasting improvements concerning their immediate interests.” Hence, the Rhodesians do not ask for much.

**Appendix-5:**
An excerpt from letters between a German poet living in Rhodesia and his family.

&gt; Boy, you&#39;ve done a TERRIFIC job of taking time out of your “busy schedule” to write to your family! Take a good look at yourself! You are now thirty-two years old, and what have you got around you but your unappreciated poetry? When I went out on the council, I introduced your dull writings to all sorts of people of high rank, and the answer, of course, was invariably NEGATIVE! I must say that, although your father was not a connoisseur, I can see that you are too obsessed with a few odd things: what is “--Selene,-- the goddess of the Moon,” and what is “--Moirai,-- the incarnation of destiny”? These phrases are like novel and bizarre PAGAN DEITIES: good thing you weren&#39;t born during the Thirty Years&#39; War! Didn&#39;t your university education, that classical education, give you better subjects than these silly pagan gods?

&gt; --I spent my early years on the beaches of Ionia and Attica, on the beautiful islands of Archipelago, enjoying pleasures that I could never have had elsewhere, and one of my cherished dreams was to go there one day and see for myself the holy land of young humanity. Greece was my first love; will it also be my last?--

The poet wrote the above phrase in the reply and blackened out key parts.

According to further investigation, the poet thereafter purchased a boat ticket to “Rhodesia” and disappeared. The poet’s posthumous work is regarded as a landmark poem based on “Rhodesia”, amidst the wave of colonisation and culture brought about by the discovery of gold in “Rhodesia”.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Instruction of O5-█ on SCP-6308&#34; hide=&#34;Instruction of O5-█ on SCP-6308&#34;]]
The investigations and discussions on SCP-6308 have largely concluded. The observations on SCP-6308 show that, even with a degree of anti-memetic influence, there is still a huge gap between the perception of the current situation and the relatively advanced technological capabilities of the European regimes that “sailed the ocean blue” and went across the time stream to SCP-6308. For us as observers, recognising this gap is what anchors us in ourselves: even if a 19th-century colonial empire that literally made “an empire on which the sun never sets”, confidence in its scientific knowledge and anticipation of the future failed to assist them in exploring the unknown, and this is the gap that exists between us and them.

Furthermore, I think it may be necessary to reject researchers’ proposal to investigate the Magallanica area, as it is not connected to any area or civilisation, former or existing, as the local inhabitants cannot even communicate in a way that meets the linguistic definition of “language”, and it is difficult to think of such a human group as being connected to any “settlements”, let alone “civilisations”. There is, therefore, no need to waste resources on this.
