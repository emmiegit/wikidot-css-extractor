**Special Containment Procedures:** Following Incident 5932-001, SCP-5932 has been effectively decommissioned, and containment is no longer necessary.

[[collapsible show=&#34;▼ Archived Containment Procedures&#34; hide=&#34;▲ Close&#34;]]
SCP-5932 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit. When removed from its unit, each instance is to be monitored at all times by no less than two handlers proficient in advanced combat training.

Every 24 hours, redundant SCP-5932 instances are to be euthanized. Due to the identical nature of separate instances, the specific instance chosen for termination is to be determined by random selection.
[[/collapsible]]

**Description:** SCP-5932, formerly Charlotte Violet Owens, was a European female 27 years of age, previously employed by the Foundation as a non-anomalous operative in MTF ζ-12 (&#34;Turtle Down&#34;)[[footnote]]A Foundation task force specializing in internally assisting sites during lockdowns.[[/footnote]]. SCP-5932 did not differ from a baseline human beyond advanced combat capabilities expected of tactical Foundation personnel.

Following an apparently random timeframe[[footnote]]The shortest recorded period was 8 minutes while the longest recorded period was 71 hours.[[/footnote]],  SCP-5932 and each subsequent instance spontaneously duplicated through an unidentified anomalous process. Subsequent instances were biologically and psychologically identical, and all instances possessed a collective memory. Each instance was capable of independent behavior and function, although research indicated that an increase in instances impaired SCP-5932&#39;s memory and sensory abilities due to human cognitive limitations.

**Addendum 5932-1:** Development

SCP-5932 was initially employed by the Foundation in 2008 as a security guard and stationed at Site-49 for four years until Containment Breach 049-21[[footnote]] A critical containment failure on 12/10/2012 involving multiple simultaneous breaches that resulted in 96 casualties.[[/footnote]]. Following complete recovery from near-fatal injuries sustained during the incident, SCP-5932 was promoted to MTF ζ-12 (&#34;Turtle Down&#34;) on the basis of exemplary conduct during active duty.

In 2013, SCP-5932 volunteered to participate in Project ASTEROIDEA, a Foundation effort to develop humanoid personnel with superior regenerative capabilities. Due to the nature of the project, only voluntary personnel deemed sufficiently loyal to the Foundation were approved for experimentation. The following files from the Project ASTEROIDEA archive have been included due to their relevance regarding the development of SCP-5932 and the initial analysis of their anomalous properties.

(//Owens is enclosed within a standard humanoid medical unit connected to SCP-████. Abelson is reviewing the components while Ito is monitoring Owens&#39; vitals.//)

**Ito:** Initializing.

(//Abelson nods slowly.//)

**Abelson:** And you&#39;re sure — //absolutely sure//— that the fusion will be stable this time? The splice needs to be as clean as we can get it, and I&#39;ll be damned if the Committee lets us waste field agents —

**Ito:** Yes, Mr. Abelson —

**Abelson:** //Doctor.//

**Ito:** Apologies. Subject is compatible, with about a 2.4% margin of error. After accounting for SCP-████&#39;s observed fluctuations, approximately 5.1%.

(//Abelson pauses.//)

**Abelson:** And how high was the previous subject&#39;s margin? With adjustments, of course.

(//Ito reviews previous records.//)

**Ito:** 3.9%, doctor. Though, all things considered —

**Abelson:** — human subjects have higher genetic complexity than laboratory mice, yes, I realize. 

(//Abelson pauses.//)

**Abelson:** And the current subject has the highest compatibility with SCP-████ of all approved candidates?

**Ito:** She&#39;s the only volunteer so far, doctor.

(//Abelson pauses.//)

**Abelson:** Interesting. I&#39;d have thought more would&#39;ve been interested at the prospect of immortality.

**Ito:** All things considered, doctor, I&#39;d assume the prospect of human experimentation is rather off-putting in and of itself.

**Abelson:** Well, that&#39;s your job now. Get used to it.

(//Silence.//)

(//System indicates completion of program.//)

**Abelson:** Ah, it&#39;s done.

(//Steam produced during the defrosting process emerges from the capsule and the central compartment opens.//)

(//Ito steps closer to observe as Owens opens her eyes.//)

**Ito:** How are you feeling, Agent Owens?

(//Owens blinks several times in rapid succession.//)

**Owens:** I — I got a splitting headache.

(//Ito turns to look towards Abelson who appears to not notice and traces a finger along a scar on his left temple.//)

**Owens:** Everything&#39;s also kind of...blurry?

(//Owens blinks and her irises duplicate.//)

**Ito:** Agent Owens?

**Owens:** What&#39;s happening —

(//Owens is unable to finish her statement before a new set of teeth develops from between her central incisors, forcing her jaw to widen to the point of dislocation. Excess tissue, bone, and flesh protrudes from both sides of her body.//)

(//Owens attempts to produce pained vocalizations, which are quickly silenced due to distortion of her neck as her clothing is punctured by a formative ribcage. A set of secondary organs developing against her exposed abdominal cavity is enveloped by developing tissue that begins coalescing into a vaguely humanoid figure.//)

(//The two figures violently split apart, and all excess growths are excreted along with the remains of Owens&#39; clothing. All lesions and cuts begin to heal, leaving two identical and otherwise undamaged SCP-5932 instances. Both instances appear to be in a state of shock and are in fetal positions.//)

(//Silence.//)

**Abelson:** Well, let&#39;s see if we&#39;ve succeeded. Sedative and scalpel, please. And keep her hand still.

Regrettably, SCP-5932-1 did not regenerate its amputated finger. However, while Project ASTEROIDEA appears to be unsuccessful, the potential applications for trained field agents with a shared consciousness are nearly limitless. It would be fascinating to see SCP-5932 returned to active duty following the 14-day quarantine, and it is my earnest hope that the fruit of my labors can be put to good while I continue progress.

(//SCP-5932-2&#39;s develops a large amount of excess tissue and flesh against their lower jaw which grows into a secondary head with the development of orifices and growth of hair. Large bones protrude from their abdomen which are rapidly enveloped by flesh and tissue. SCP-5932-2&#39;s uniform tears as their form begins separating into two distinct humanoid figures.//)

Despite your adamant insistence, SCP-5932 has continued to duplicate and is currently at 64 instances. Considering we only have 150 quarantine units, SCP-5932 will be uncontainable within two duplication events. It&#39;s only been //one week//, and we&#39;re already approaching the uppermost limits of our site.

I am fully aware of the fact that biological anomalies are not to be interfered with during their quarantine period. However, O5 Command has voted unanimously to allow an exception in the case of SCP-5932 so as to prevent our site from falling into disarray. As such, I am reassigning you to SCP-5932, effective immediately.

You did this, Abelson. Get it under control.

As neutralizing an independent SCP-5932 instance does not affect the others permanently, I propose adopting routine termination of redundant SCP-5932 instances as a constituent of the subject&#39;s containment procedures. Apart from this, subject can be contained as a standard humanoid anomaly.

Josie,

Every time one of me falls, it&#39;s like a little bit of me dies with it. And I know it&#39;s crazy, because I&#39;m still alive, but I just have to wonder, at what point do I stop being me?

It&#39;s like Gabriel&#39;s Horn — that recursive geometry thing you used to be so obsessed with. Every time one of me dies, I&#39;m half of what I used to be, but I&#39;m never all the way gone. But what&#39;s it even mean to live if I&#39;m a fraction of a fraction of myself?

And then there&#39;s you. God, I miss you so much.

Josephine Lillian Whitley. Still don&#39;t know why I put up with your theories and thought experiments and whatever. Too smart to be a grunt. Hell, too smart for me —

Me. Charlotte Violet Owens. I guess underneath it all, I&#39;m just another dumb girl scared of dying or falling in love. Too careful for my own good, too ambitious for anyone around me. Did you ever even know how I felt about you? Did you ever feel the same way?

--I hope you did. I hope you knew that I was only ever so scared of dying because I was scared of leaving you. I hope you knew that every time I called you an idiot, I was really calling myself an idiot, because I only needed to tell you I love you but I marched around in circles trying to run from myself because I was afraid.--

I hope you forget me. I hope you don&#39;t give a fuck about Charlie Owens, or where I am, or how I&#39;m doing.

I hope I forget, too.

Then I won&#39;t have anything left to lose.

(//SCP-5932-1 is laying on their side in bed and rubbing the back of their head as Ito enters the unit.//)

**Ito:** Can&#39;t sleep again?

(//SCP-5932-1 exhales and turns to face Ito.//)

**SCP-5932-1:** Not if you keep barging in here at 1 in the morning.

(//Ito offers SCP-5932-1 a cup.//)

**Ito:** Would tea help?

(//SCP-5932-1 scoffs.//)

**SCP-5932-1:** Tea is just a way for rich people to sell dead leaves.

(//Ito smiles.//)

**Ito:** Who said that?

**SCP-5932-1:** Josie — a, um, friend of mine from Turtle Down. 

**Ito:** Mhm.

(//Ito places the cup on a desk.//)

**Ito:** Personally, I think of tea as a way to honor that which has already gone.

(//SCP-5932-1 does not respond and continues rubbing the back of their head.//)

**Ito:** That reminds me.

(//Ito sets a small pill container by SCP-5932-1.//)

(//SCP-5932-1 sits up.//)

**SCP-5932-1:** Painkillers?

(//Ito nods.//)

(//SCP-5932-1 smiles, removing a small white tablet and swallowing it with a sip of water.//)

(//Ito sits down as SCP-5932-1 closes their eyes while continuing to rub the back of their head.//)

**Ito:** How bad is the pain?

**SCP-5932-1:** Pain isn&#39;t even the worst part. There&#39;s nothing anyone can do about it, though.

(//Ito looks towards SCP-5932-1.//)

**Ito:** Do you mind telling me what the worst part is?

**SCP-5932-1:** Brick pillows?

(//Ito smiles.//)

(//SCP-5932-1 exhales and looks down.//)

(//Silence.//)

**SCP-5932-1:** It&#39;s the moment before. Knowing I&#39;m about to die.

(//Ito frowns.//)

**Ito:** But you don&#39;t actually //die//, do you?

(//SCP-5932-1 shakes their head.//)

**SCP-5932-1:** Maybe //I// haven&#39;t, but //they// certainly do.

(//SCP-5932-1 pauses.//)

**SCP-5932-1:** It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t know one of us is going to survive. It&#39;s just that — I can&#39;t help but wonder whether I&#39;m the one that dies this time.

(//SCP-5932-1 pauses.//)

**SCP-5932-1:** And the sheer — sheer utter //hopelessness.// Like — like a butterfly in a hurricane. I can&#39;t help but be //terrified.//

**SCP-5932-1:** I could die, or I could live to die again, but there&#39;s only so much of me to kill.

(//Silence.//)

**Ito:** I&#39;m sorry. I mean, I can&#39;t ever understand — but I hope that, maybe, it gets better —

(//SCP-5932-1 scoffs.//)

**SCP-5932-1:** How could dying get &#34;better&#34;?

**Ito:** I —

(//Ito pauses.//)

**Ito:** I was thinking that — thinking maybe one day, death itself becomes so familiar that you&#39;re like good friends.

**SCP-5932-1:** What, like me and you? Not unless I have some serious Stockholm syndrome.

(//SCP-5932-1 lays back down and turns away from Ito.//)

(//Ito sighs and stands up.//)

**Ito:** Goodnight, Ms. Owens.

(//SCP-5932-1 is listening to music on their bed as Ito enters the unit.//)

**Ito:** Morning, Ms. Owens.

(//SCP-5932-1 removes their headphones and pauses their music before turning to face Ito.//)

(//Ito nods towards SCP-5932-1&#39;s MP3 player.//)

**Ito:** What were you listening to?

**SCP-5932-1:** Coldplay.

(//Ito nods.//)

**Ito:** Anyways, I&#39;m here to get your vitals.

(//SCP-5932-1 extends an arm for Ito to wrap a blood pressure cuff around.//)

**Ito:** Put that on your finger.

(//Ito hands SCP-5932-1 the scanner and waits.//)

**Ito:** 117/80. Temperature.

(//Ito removes a thermal scanner and points it towards SCP-5932-1&#39;s forehead.//)

**Ito:** 37°.

(//Silence.//)

**SCP-5932-1:** What&#39;s the point of ASTEROIDEA?

(//Ito frowns.//)

**Ito:** Hmm?

**SCP-5932-1:** To Abelson, I mean. Why does it matter to him?

(//Ito pauses.//)

**Ito:** Why did you volunteer for ASTEROIDEA?

(//SCP-5932-1 pauses.//)

**SCP-5932-1:** I almost died once, I think.

**Ito:** Yes. It was in your medical file.

(//SCP-5932-1 nods.//)

**SCP-5932-1:** Kind of ironic how I volunteered for ASTEROIDEA to run from death, and now I face it every day...

(//SCP-5932-1 pauses.//)

**SCP-5932-1:** Like I said before, only people are worth dying for. I didn&#39;t know what ASTEROIDEA was going to do to me, but I did this for Josie. And now —

(//SCP-5932-1 swallows.//)

**SCP-5932-1:** I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll see her ever again.

(//Silence.//)

**Ito:** I think Abelson is running from death, too. Only...he lost himself in the process.

Josie, do you remember when we used to lay down in our bunks and fall asleep listening to X&amp;Y, or A Rush of Blood to the Head, or whatever you left on that night? That&#39;s how you got me into Coldplay in the first place — and that&#39;s how I got into //you.//

I used to wish that I was lying next to you, and we&#39;d be staring at the stars over a beach, and it would just be you and me, forever. 

Now, I&#39;m just glad I remember.

Ito thinks that I&#39;m overwriting old memories because humans only have so much mental storage. Hell, I can&#39;t remember my middle name now. Don&#39;t know how long it&#39;s going to be until I forget my whole name. And then how much longer until I forget you?

And once I do, what&#39;s the point?

I mean, who am I anymore? It&#39;s like the Charlie that used to exist isn&#39;t the same as the one that exists now — not sure if it&#39;s because something was taken from her, or if it&#39;s because she&#39;s just not complete anymore.

**Abelson:** December 10th, 2012 was the day your lung was punctured — and the day my skull was fractured. We met death on the same day, and we&#39;ve both been running ever since.

(//Abelson pauses.//)

**Abelson:** You&#39;ve died how many times now? You must be used to it. But me —

**Abelson:** Death has taken ourselves from both of us, SCP-5932.

(//Silence.//)

**SCP-5932-1:** SCP-5932 — is that who I am now? 

(//Abelson smiles sadly.//)

**Abelson:** That&#39;s right. As for me...I&#39;m just another doctor.

**Abelson:** I may be alive, but death has stolen Ezriel Abelson from me.

I&#39;m not afraid of dying. Why should I be?

Death is like a little sparrow who taps on the window every night to carry part of me away. He comes every evening before I fall asleep against the glass. And then I wake up, and it&#39;s like Charlie was a dream from another life, and I can only remember fragments — out of order and out of place. Like I don&#39;t belong anymore.

(//SCP-5932-1 and -2 are sitting against opposite sides of the room. A loud buzzer sound indicates McNamara&#39;s entrance.//)

**McNamara:** Alright, you know the drill. Up against the wall.

(//Abelson is sitting alone in a small office space.//)

(//The door opens as Kim enters the room. He walks around the table and sits down opposite Abelson.//)

(//Kim removes a flask from the inside of his blazer and takes a sip.//)

**Kim:** Morning, Ezriel.

**Abelson:** Ezriel? I&#39;m just a doctor.

(//Kim scoffs.//)

**Kim:** If you say so. Now, I know neither of us are much for small talk, so save us both some time and just get to it, shall we?

(//Abelson nods.//)

(//Kim places a file on the desk.//)

**Kim:** I presume you know what I&#39;m here about?

(//Abelson glances at the file.//)

**Abelson:** SCP-5932?

**Kim:** Charlotte Owens, yes. Why don&#39;t you brief me on her containment procedures?

**Abelson:** I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve got it in your file.

**Kim:** Well, I&#39;d like to hear it from you. Details can get lost in translation, so to speak.

(//Abelson slides the file across the table and opens it, removing the first document and adjusting his glasses.//)

**Abelson:** &#34;SCP-5932 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit. When removed from its unit, each instance is to be monitored at all times by no less than two handlers proficient in advanced combat training.&#34;

(//Kim takes a sip from his flask.//)

**Abelson:** &#34;Every 24 hours, redundant SCP-5932 instances are to be euthanized —&#34;

**Kim:** Killed.

**Abelson:** I&#39;m sorry?

**Kim:** To cause the death of something or someone —

**Abelson:** I know what &#34;killed&#34; means.

**Kim:** Perhaps you&#39;ll consider adding it to your vocabulary, then.

(//Abelson shakes his head.//)

**Abelson:** She isn&#39;t killed. She can&#39;t die.

(//Kim smiles.//)

**Kim:** Is that so?

**Abelson:** (//Quietly//) Owens is already gone.

(//Kim takes a sip from his flask.//)

**Abelson:** &#34;Due to the identical nature of separate instances, the specific instance chosen for termination is to be determined by random selection.&#34;

**Kim:** Alright then. A little demonstration, if you will?

(//Abelson does not respond.//)

(//Kim removes a pen from his pocket.//)

**Kim:** This is a bullet.

(//Kim points the pen towards Abelson&#39;s forehead.//)

**Kim:** If it goes through your head —

(//Kim extends the tip of the pen with a sharp click.//)

**Kim:** — what would happen?

(//Abelson winces and presses a palm against his forehead.//)

(//Silence.//)

(//Kim leans back against his chair and crosses his arms.//)

**Kim:** Operating under the assumption your current containment procedures are perpetually effective, how many deaths will that be?

**Abelson:** She isn&#39;t alive anymore — she&#39;s more gone than left. 

**Kim:** Owens is alive, last I checked.

(//Abelson shakes his head.//)

**Abelson:** SCP-5932 is alive. And they&#39;ll get used to it if they haven&#39;t already.

**Kim:** Did you?

(//Abelson pauses.//)

**Abelson:** I live with it.

(//Kim laughs.//)

**Kim:**  And that&#39;s what ASTEROIDEA is about, right? 

**Abelson:** (//Quietly//) It&#39;s all I have left of Ezriel anymore.

(//Silence.//)

**Kim:** Alright. This is what&#39;s going to happen.

(//Kim folds his hand on the desk.//)

**Kim:** You&#39;re permanently removed from ASTEROIDEA. Any disagreement you have can be voiced to the Project Management Administration — although you&#39;d then have to explain why you&#39;re on the human experimentation blacklist.

(//Kim pauses.//)

**Kim:** And you&#39;re going to put Owens down for good. Let her die in peace already.

[[size 140%]]**Decommissioning Proposal**[[/size]]
[[/=]]
-----
**Item #:** SCP-5932

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Head Researcher:** Senior Researcher Ezriel Abelson

**Supporting Personnel:** Unnecessary*

**Please check off or fill in the applicable boxes regarding the reasons for submitting your proposal:**
☐ Excessive Risk of Lifted Veil Scenario
☐ Excessive Danger
☑ Expense
☑ Ethical Concern
☐ Legal Concern
☐ Potential to Decommission Apollyon-Class Object
☑ High Risk of K-Class Scenario (if so, please state which type(s)): NK-Class Type 2
☐ Other (please state): 

**Summary:** Containment of SCP-5932 is unethical and unsustainable due to a theoretical requirement for infinite euthanasia. Additionally, the cremated cadavers of deceased SCP-5932 instances will eventually affect the Earth&#39;s atmosphere, resulting in inhospitality.

*This proposal has been submitted under direct O5 Command and/or Ethics Committee mandate.

(//Ito pauses.//)

**Ito:** I think most of us aren&#39;t scared of dying, you know. I think we&#39;re just scared of losing what we love — scared of losing who we are.

(//Ito pauses.//)

**Ito:** But even if you aren&#39;t who you used to be — even if the old you is dead — that doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t belong, or that you deserve to die. And I — 

(//Ito pauses.//)

**Ito:** If it were up to me, I&#39;d say you deserve a chance to live. Not as who you were, but as who you would have been. A life where you don&#39;t have to live as though death were your shadow, but you don&#39;t have to fear it, either.

(//Silence.//)

(//SCP-5932-1 sighs.//)

**SCP-5932-1:** I guess it&#39;s too late for that, though.

(//Ito nods slowly and approaches SCP-5932-1 with the syringe.//)

**Ito:** Think of it like going to sleep.

(//SCP-5932-1 smiles sadly and looks up at Ito.//)

**SCP-5932-1:** Will I wake up?
