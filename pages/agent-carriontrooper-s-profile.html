    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Name:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Code Name:** Carriontrooper

**Current Designation:** Undercover Agent

**Current Location:** [DATA EXPUNGED], Indonesia

**Expertise:** Intelligence gathering, [DATA EXPUNGED], and [DATA EXPUNGED].

**History:** Information about this person is largely corrupted, but it is known that he originated from Indonesia. He had entered Universitas Gadjah Mada (Gadjah Mada University) in Yogyakarta, but his records were incomplete and rendered as useless data. He was initially encountered by the foundation while investigating a possible SCP in [DATA EXPUNGED], and intrigued field agents by discreetly [DATA MISSING]. After an intense quarantine and testing period of [DATA EXPUNGED], he was recruited as an undercover agent. His skill in intelligence gathering is quite high, and personnel must keep from telling him [DATA MISSING].

It is noted, however, that the subject had suffered mental delusions that could be attributed either to his slightly eccentric nature or a past experience with a memetic SCP. Also, due to an unknown reason, he had often been mistaken for a lot of things, resulting in confusion, annoyance, and/or hilarity for other personnel. 

Additional note: Agent Carriontrooper is not very adept at the proper use and deployment of explosives, although he often uses them. Excercise caution when he is in the vicinity. Please return all unexploded ordnance or explosives found in the immediate area back to the explosives storage or the armory.

Additional note: Be aware that Agent Carriontrooper had been repeatedly kicked out of the site 19 mess hall, presumably trying to steal food. An anonymous source said &#39;He talks too much&#39; and another says &#39;That dude&#39;s kinda annoying&#39; while stating that he could be restrained from the mess hall if he repeated the offense. It is unknown how he managed to sneak in the mess hall again after being kicked; investigation underway to find hidden access points to the mess hall.
