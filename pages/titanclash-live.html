[[tab The Kaiju]]

Welcome to the international database on kaiju management. We are so happy to have you join us today to learn more about our biggest growing industry.

To get us started, it is without a doubt that our world would not be what it is today without the advancements made in kaiju development, research, and utilization. From food production to protection to even entertainment, the kaiju have changed our world for the better. Colloquially known as titans, the documented history of relevant technological advancements can be read about below.

+ Origins

Since The 2003 Incident, where escaped kaiju wrecked havoc on international servers, we&#39;ve lost nearly all of the original historical records that were kept on the kaiju. We&#39;ve spent the past 200+ years since then advancing and making new discoveries, but success on restoring the old records has been limited at best. This has lead to there being many conflicting theories towards the origin of the kaiju, with magic, aliens, and technology being the most popular theories. While recent studies have shown they are not currently extraterrestrial in nature, and DNA testing has shown there was no preexisting animal the kaiju have evolved from, science has developed the kaiju genome to the point that the origins are often seen as irrelevant or as general speculation.

While we may never have one true answer on their creation, each kaiju development corporation has their own rich history about their discovery, development, and technological advancements. Those records are plentiful, and it is much easier to track the more recent impacts on society through the lenses of said corporations than it is to dig into the more murky past.

+ Relic Kaiju

One of the biggest pieces of kaiju history that we still have today are the relic kaiju. Using non-Earth technology that we&#39;ve been unable to replicate, they can do things that science thought was never possible. The majority have been decommissioned; however, to utilize as historic teaching tools, or to fuel future research efforts to continue advancing our societal technology. Rarely, a select few are recommissioned for special event entertainment purposes. It is unknown how many relic kaiju exist beyond the ones documented in decommission records or that have been approved for entertainment.

+ Current Kaiju

Being a bioengineered creation, the kinds of kaiju vary greatly. Creatures that are heavily biological based, heavily technological based, or a hybrid of the two all exist, depending on the kaiju&#39;s intended purpose. Uses for kaiju include farming, large scale industrial work, deep-space mining, scientific study for advancement of biotechnology and biomedicine, and of course, entertainment, to name just a few.

Kaiju used for larger scale industrial work, mining, and certain farming applications tend to be larger than kaiju used for research and entertainment. Terrestrial kaiju are often no larger than the prehistoric dinosaurs, while aerial kaiju are often smaller and aquatic kaiju are larger. While older film and media loves its city sized kaiju, practical applications lead to smaller sizes being more efficient and cost effective.

+ Kaiju Laws and Regulations

Kaiju are dangerous entities, and need to be treated as such. Even if perfectly engineered for farming, they are large mechanical creatures with the ability to trample, maul, and easily injure humans and destroy property. Additionally, many kaiju are toxic to consume or will pollute waterways when decomposing, so proper disposal and recycling are critical.

Laws and regulations for kaiju vary by country, but to keep the general public safe, kajiu are often required to be registered, so many kaiju come with a kill switch, are carefully managed and monitored, and heavy fines along with jail time will result if there is misuse of kaiju or other relevant kaiju disasters. Please consult your local government authority for kaiju registration requirements.

While registration and management of kaiju is common place for kaiju entering tournaments or government workforce, there are underground companies that cut corners and illegally manufacture kaiju. These groups are to be reported, and supporting them will result in jail time. Please call our [# tip line] if you have information regarding illegal manufacturing, fighting, disposal, consumption, or augmentation of kaiju.

+ Kaiju and You

The kaiju industry has led to thousands of jobs, resources, and entertainment for the general public. The most well known aspect of the industry being being the International Disaster Deathmatch League (IDDL), the largest and only internationally recognized kaiju fighting league. Happening every five years and lasting one year, one match happens every two weeks with time in-between for rebuilding the facade city. The host city rotates every time as well, with it being a big honor to be the city hosting that year. While the IDDL is a great part of the industry, did you know there are plenty of other, local industries you can join as well? Support one today by checking out the list below! Jobs opportunities are diverse, and a match can be made for everyone. Popular choices include:

* Manufacturing and development
* Design and concept creation
* Event planning and corporate management
* Religious oversight and theological study
* Biochemistry
* Medical study
* ...and many more!

[[tab The Capitals]]

There are many major cities and other locations[[footnote]] When using these real life locations, please do your research and be sensitive to their history. [[/footnote]] - often referred to as kaiju capitals - where the leading innovation in kaiju creation, entertainment, and recycling, takes place. The globally recognized ones are listed below.

If you&#39;re curious to learn more about each capital, or the specific kaiju that call those capitals their home, check out the reports from each city[[footnote]]You can manually add stories that take place in each city or detail each city to the report section below each capital. Follow the bulleted list formatting.[[/footnote]]. They detail famous battles that have taken place there, common tourist attractions, the history of each city, and much more!


+ Entertainment Capitals:

&gt;  **Chicxulub, Yucatán Peninsula, México.**
&gt;
&gt; //Biomaterial Amphibian Deathbattles//
&gt;
&gt;  Filled to the brim with bio-augmented devout, radicalized gene-hackers and social miscreants who blur the line between fashionable mutations and inhuman abominations, Chicxulub&#39;s ring-shaped architecture allows for the city to show off its historic landmark – the giant impact crater left behind by the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs. At its very center, an arena dominates the lives of all who dwell there, a temple for the worshiping of gods made of flesh rather than a podium for the vulgar entertainment seen elsewhere. Befitting the city&#39;s location in-between the jungles of the peninsula and the warm tropical sea beyond, the kaiju here are the proud children of bioengineering science, versatile creatures who are mighty on land and unstoppable beneath the waves.

&gt; **Coober Pedy, South Australia**
&gt;
&gt; //Biomaterial Deathbattles//
&gt;
&gt; While it may look like a wasteland from the surface, Coober Pedy is teaming full of life. Once famous for its opal, the large mines have since been converted into state of the art underground battle arenas. This helps beat the heat, and provides a truly unique kaiju combat experience that draws tourist from worldwide. Specializing in fully biomaterial and minimal cybernetic kaiju, the kaiju that call Coober Pedy their home tend to be smaller than the kaiju you&#39;ll find elsewhere, but that doesn&#39;t make them any less ferocious! Remember to pack your night vision goggles if traveling here for entertainment - they&#39;re a must-have to see these living fights for the magic they are.

&gt;  **Macau**
&gt;
&gt; //Aquatic Deathbattles//
&gt;
&gt;  The sparkling island of Macau could rightfully be considered the entertainment capital of the world. Everything from the giant sea battles to the night life to the city culture is taken to the extreme. Home of those who love gambling, performance, and showmanship, there is never a dull moment on the island. Bathed in neon light, spectators can watch aquatic kaiju battle it out in the nearby estuaries from the safety of the beach. But that&#39;s not all - fans can also expect to see their favorite kaiju before and after matches as well, and if they want a break from the action, there&#39;s plenty of casinos, resorts, and hotels to take a break at instead.

&gt; **Phoenix, Arizona, USA**
&gt;
&gt;  //Cybernetic Deathbattles//
&gt;
&gt;  Centered around a massive arena complex, the hundreds of towering skyscrapers and corporate buildings lead to Phoenix being just as industrial as the kaiju that fight in it. Specializing in combat between fully mechanical and minimal biomaterial kajiu, Phoenix is popular with the corporate population, leading to it being the best city for fighting leagues to find sponsors and monetary support. The city is also one of the largest financial and logistic hubs for both kaiju and non-kaiju industries, and regularly attracts shipping and railway industries to make distribution hubs there. Be sure to bring some water and sunblock though! With temperatures regularly getting up into 49°C (120°F), you&#39;ll want to pay extra for the arena seats that come with cooling mists.

+ Manufacturing Capitals:

&gt; **Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA**
&gt;
&gt; //Cybernetic Kaiju Manufacturing Center//
&gt;
&gt; With a long history of nuclear power, Albuquerque has the energy needed to be the largest robotic and cybernetic kaiju creation center. While not as generally mass producing as Madagascar, Alburquerque is known for making specialized parts that can&#39;t be made elsewhere, and has trade-secret techniques towards making kaiju power systems that exceed efficiency levels of all other known manufacturing centers. Albuquerque also has its own recycling center, and can process mechanical parts that can&#39;t be naturally disposed of elsewhere.

&gt; **Madagascar**
&gt;
&gt; //Largest Kaiju Manufacturing Center//
&gt;
&gt; The entire island of Madagascar has been converted into the world&#39;s largest overall manufacturing center. Many of the latest industry standards come out of the island and many of the most famous kaiju specialists have or currently work there. While security and secrecy can be tight with even travel and mail restricted, the well paying jobs available and recognition that come from working there make it the dream workplace of many aspiring students and tradespeople. It may not be able to be on your summer vacation destination list, but see if your local college or university has internship or study abroad programs for the especially hardworking members of your family!

&gt; **Marshall Islands**
&gt;
&gt; //Aquatic Kaiju Manufacturing Center//
&gt;
&gt; With a lot of history in its waters, many of the islands have been repurposed today to be the most famous aquatic manufacturing center. Giant kaiju hatcheries and nurseries are suspended in specialized bays around the islands, and the area is closely monitored as to not interfere with local shipping routes.

+ Disposal and Recycling Capitals:

&gt; **Death Valley, California, USA**
&gt;
&gt; //Disposal Center//
&gt;
&gt; The desert heat, dry climate, and remote location allows for Death Valley to be the largest, internationally-used kaiju boneyard. After more valuable or company secret parts are recycled, the remaining kaiju corpses are brought here for disposal. While once recognized as a national park, it was rebranded as a disposal center to protect the general public from toxic and radioactive kaiju remains. Even with the park status removed, there are still plenty of informational museums and hiking trails to visit on the outskirts of the valley. Bring binoculars! If you&#39;re lucky you&#39;ll be able to see the remains of some of the most famous kaiju from decades past.

[[tab Writing Guide]]
The themes of this canon should be fairly transparent, at least during the days where everything is only partially formed. Potential things you might be interested in writing about include:

* Capitalism, consumer culture, and corporate greed
* Historic symbolism of kaiju and what they traditionally represent in media
* The ethics of scientific advancement (too preoccupied if you could to think if you should)
* Fear of the unknown / what we can&#39;t control
* Government control over society

Generally speaking, if you have an idea: write it. Nothing&#39;s canon until it&#39;s on the site, and even then it&#39;s flexible. Nothing exists in this world unless you say it does. The past, present and future are all waiting to be decided. Here and now, you are as gods.

++++ Okay, but what actually //is// this?

This canon, titled TitanClash LIVE, is the hub of our third collaboratively-constructed canon, courtesy of the new [[[sss2 | Serpentine Sorting System]]]. The full description of how this process works is available on that hub page, but the general gist is as follows:

# You submit writing prompts.
# We curate the prompts into a poll. You perform Democracy and whittle them down to a single survivor.
# This single prompt becomes the seed of a new canon. We nurture it. You discuss it on the [[[system:real-time-chat | Discord server]]].
# We curate your ideas into a hub, which with any luck you&#39;re currently reading. You write for this hub, and shape the new canon to your will. We update this page as more ideas are spawned and refined.
# The canon solidifies. Staff and users alike sit back and bask in the new writing. Everybody wins.

This prompt was provided by [[*user Din Bidor]], and won out of 64 submissions. The Curators of the canon are currently [[*user LAN 2D]] and [[*user meltedbee]]. Contact them if you have any questions or concerns.</textarea></pre>
