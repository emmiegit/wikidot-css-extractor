* [[[SCP-2298]]] (&#34;Life in a Plastic Box&#34;) - Go into a shed, and you&#39;ll come across a city of mannequins. A closer look shows it&#39;s not just a world of fake plastic dummies and fake plastic trees. Written by [[*user Eekium]].

+++ Fandom Stuff

What&#39;s been going on in the community aside from our site? Well...

* [http://scpfoundation.ru/site-7-midnight-radio Site 7 Midnight Radio] - A podcast hosted by [[*user Blackbird5154]] and technical help and publishing done by [[*user iavev]] over on the Russian site!

* This Exists, a YouTube channel pointing out and explaining cool pop culture stuff, did a video on the SCP Wiki! The [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55igYZ0EShc video] is short and succinct, and while it doesn&#39;t cover everything, it&#39;s a great entry video for those new.
* [https://www.reddit.com/r/Daily_SCP/ Daily_SCP] is a subreddit that showcases a new SCP a day, from the well-known to the obscure and hidden. A good way to find new skips you may not have heard of; I know I&#39;ve discovered a couple new favorites from it. It&#39;s run by user HighlyDestruct7.

Come back next month when there&#39;s more articles and content your way! This is a new feature, so let me know what you think, if the standards for showcasing should be greater (this showcased articles with a rating higher than +10[[footnote]]Exceptions will most likely be author pages, because those are special enough to showcase[[/footnote]]), what fancontent I&#39;ve missed, etc. I&#39;d be happy to make this better for you guys! :)
