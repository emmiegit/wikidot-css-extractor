[[size large]] **Authorized Response Level:** [[/size]]

##red|[[size 250%]] 4 [[/size]]## **(Severe Threat)**

[[size large]] **Description:** [[/size]]

UTE-1666-Goodrick-Freud refers to an unknown thaumatological phenomenon that occurs at random intervals. During an occurrence of this phenomenon, one or more subjects[[footnote]] Usually no more than six. [[/footnote]] will be affected, triggering backlashes that irreversibly alter their Elan Vital Energy patterns[[footnote]] Said backlashes aren&#39;t visually observable, and can only be detected with Ethereal Resonance Imaging Devices, such as VERITAS or EMERY Counters. [[/footnote]].

According to the gathered evidence, subjects affected by UTE-1666 will present radical behavioral changes for approximately eleven minutes and six seconds after the event, which may widely vary between individuals, but always tends towards aggressiveness and compulsive behaviors.

The skin of affected subjects will become considerably more fragile, usually triggering bleeding with relative ease. Affected subjects will not exhibit signs of pain or other symptoms caused by blood loss, which, once the behavioral changes manifest, will begin to experience several chemical and molecular changes resulting in a partially fluorescent and dense liquid similar to red ink, designated UTE-1666-Goodrick-Freudchild.

The consumption of UTE-1666-child will result in {{&lt;CLASSIFIED LEVEL Q BY ORDER OF GOC HIGH COMMAND&gt;}}, unlike the original affected subject. Notably, UTE-1666-child&#39;s effects won&#39;t disappear or dissipate after the subject to which it belonged is killed or otherwise eliminated and, on the contrary, seem to increase.

[[size large]] **Engagement Rules:** [[/size]]

Subjects affected by UTE-1666 are to be engaged by trained or deep cover operatives only due to the affected subject&#39;s inherent hostility towards human beings. Agents are to capture and transfer to a Coalition headquarters without causing any physical harm that may provoke massive bleeding due to the imminent risk of cross-contamination.

In the event of an attack with no alternative, it is suggested to confront the subject with the use of a firearm for safe neutralization. If that is not possible, the operative is to obscure the subject&#39;s range of vision, either through physical damage or using distraction maneuvers.

If the affected subject has spilled UTE-1666-child on the surroundings, the area is to be decontaminated via incineration, as well as the non-essential equipment that might have been in contact with the substance. Operatives infected with UTE-1666-child will be either terminated or subjected to special purification thaumaturgical rituals, as deemed appropriate by the GOC High Command or the Headquarters Director in question.

[[size large]] **History:** [[/size]]

It is believed that the first time UTE-1666 came to the Coalition&#39;s attention was in 1935 after an incident occurred in Kannapolis, North Carolina, in which six teenagers were seen violently attacking passersby. The group of teens would be later shot down by local police forces, and the area was inspected by Assessment Team 1314 &#34;Gehenna Ambassadors&#34;, discovering small samples of UTE-1666-child and various ritualistic symbols in a nearby abandoned building.

Said building was found to have been used in what was first believed to be a summoning thaumaturgical ritual, according to the appearance and possible nature of the many objects found inside, among which stand out chandeliers and pieces of cloth with the aforementioned symbols, and it was theorized that the teenagers were affected or possessed by several [[[scp-4661|Tartarean Entities]]].

Investigations discovered all symbols found in the zone were non-anomalous and possessed no ritualistic properties nor thaumaturgical use, which led the assigned agents to believe the group had been affected by a spontaneous anomalous event, though this could not be confirmed as no similar cases occurred in the following years. Research into the incident ceased following a lack of leads.

However, the first confirmed occurrence of UTE-1666 happened in 1999, after the sudden murder of PHYSICS Agent Itzel &#34;Duivel&#34; Blisset in Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina. The killer was later identified as Michael Hutchinson, an agent from the Federal Bureau of Investigations [[[unusual-incidents-unit-hub|Unusual Incidents Unit]]] who had been reported missing the previous day.

Quickly after that, PSYCHE Division&#39;s Ambassador Agent Lucero Fern√°ndez contacted the UIU and engaged in a series of diplomatic talks to discuss the implications of the incident. During said conversations, it was discovered that the UIU, thanks to an Information Exchange Treaty signed with the [[[horizon-initiative-hub|Horizon Initiative]]], had in its possession a document referring to the previously mentioned 1935 Incident {{(see PSYCHE RECORDS, EVIDENCE: TRINITY FILE)}} written by this group.

After both organizations reached an agreement, a Joint Research, Strike, and Assessment Team was created and received the codename &#34;TRITONE&#34;[[footnote]] It had been previously designated as &#34;Mathers Commission&#34; by the UIU and &#34;RS&amp;AT Kanskart&#34; by the GOC, [[/footnote]]. The Team Members were tasked with investigating UTE-1666 and collecting related information that other organizations might have discovered through the years.

Below is shown an excerpt of a dossier regarding the status and purpose of TRITONE.

In 2001, at the insistence of Agent Mathers, investigations were also conducted on the Council of 108, as well as the Global Occult Coalition itself, to verify if {{&lt;CLASSIFIED LEVEL Q BY ORDER OF GOC HIGH COMMAND&gt;}}. However, while the gathered evidence was being evaluated, on November 4th, 2001, KTE-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà escaped and made its way to Dolente VII, where TRITONE and several other GOC and UIU personnel were housed and attacked them. Strike Team ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà was quickly sent to the area to liquidate the entity; however, during the process, the building collapsed, killing the entirety of the Team and the few survivors left, along with the KTE.

The claims made by Agent Mathers were disproved by several GOC Researchers shortly after TRITONE&#39;s official dissolution, on January 11th, 2002.

The Subject came to UIU&#39;s attention on June 8th, 1999, after the local police of Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, informed about a mid-aged man with red glowing eyes eating what seemed to be the corpse of an adult woman.

Once UIU personnel arrived at the scene, it was discovered that the Subject was Special Agent Michael Hutchinson, reported missing one day ago, and the victim was an unidentified Global Occult Coalition&#39;s Agent with the codename &#34;Duivel&#34;.

The Subject was arrested with relative ease, without permanent casualties, and sent to a UIU facility for questioning and investigation.

Below is shown a transcript of the interview, carried out by Special Agent Lewis Mando.

//{{&lt;Interview begins&gt;}}//

{{//**[**As soon as MANDO enters the room, SUBJECT struggles and attempts to break free from restraints, without success**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Woah. Calm down, Hutchinson. I&#39;m here to ask you some questions, should be something quick, do you understand?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT stops struggling, but does not answer**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** I repeat. I&#39;m here to ask you a few questions, do you understand?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT nods slightly**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Alright. In the first place, why did you attack and murder that woman?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT does not answer and gently moves his head from one side to the other**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** I&#39;m waiting for your answer, Hutchinson.}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT does not respond**]**//}}

{{//**[**MANDO sighs**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** I hope that you&#39;re aware that the woman you brutally killed was a //Gock// **[sic]** Agent. If you do not confess why did you do that to her, you might get in //actual// trouble, and will most likely involve us as well. So?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT remains silent**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Forget it. SUBJECT is clearly out of his mind, he isn&#39;t going to--}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT struggles and shouts incoherent sounds, apparently attempting to speak**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Woah!}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT opens and half-closes his mouth, and shakes his head from side to side**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Hutchinson, is something wrong?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT violently nods**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Tell me, what is it?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT opens and half-closes his mouth**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Hutchinson, what&#39;s the matter?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT does not answer**]**//}}

{{//**[**MANDO sighs**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Hutchinson, I won&#39;t be able to tell the problem if you don&#39;t--}}

{{//**[**Brief silence**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Wait. You cannot speak, can you?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT slightly shakes his head from side to side**]**}}//

{{**MANDO:** Alright, alright. I, uh, I guess we&#39;ll be making this a little bit different, okay?.}}

{{//**[**MANDO clears his throat**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** So, going back to the original question... Do you understand what you&#39;ve done, right?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT nods**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** And you killed &#34;Duivel&#34; for any particular reason, be it personal or otherwise?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT negates with his head**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** No? Then... was it an accident?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT remains silent for a few seconds, then shakes his head from side to side**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** No? I... I don&#39;t think I understand. You are saying you didn&#39;t kill the Agent on purpose, but it wasn&#39;t an accident either. I mean, it&#39;s quite obvious it was //not// an accident, but... then what happened? Is there a... third option that explains it?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT violently nods**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** So there //is// a third option, but...}}

{{//**[**Silence**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Damn, if... if only you were... able to talk.}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT suddenly moves from side to side aggressively**]**//}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT struggles for a few more seconds, then stops and looks at the floor**]**//}}

{{//**[**Silence**]**//}}

{{//**[**MANDO sighs**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Hutchinson, I&#39;m sorry if I said something that bothered you, but you have to control yourself. Could you please do that, so we can continue the interrogation session? Could you control yourself for a while?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT raises its head to make eye contact with MANDO, and shakes it from side to side**]**//}}

{{//**[**MANDO stares at SUBJECT and remains silent**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** What?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT starts to tremble slightly**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** No... No. Are you saying you... you cannot control yourself?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT nods**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** But, I-- ah, do you... do you mean you feel an urge to kill that you cannot repress, quite like that [[[uiu-file-1941-016|Polish guy]]]?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT shakes his head**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Then... what do you mean when you said you can&#39;t control yourself?}}

{{//**[**Silence**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Hutchinson, I... Do you mean it&#39;s like... like a tic, a motor tic?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT remains silent for a while, then nods**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Alright, alright... do you know how did you acquire this... tic?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT shakes his head**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Not at all? Not a slight idea of how could have that happened?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT looks to the floor and shakes his head**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Ok. Now, you were reported missing yesterday after a week of searching before reappearing suddenly today. Could you explain why did you do that? Was it because of the tic we mentioned before?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT shakes his head in silence**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Did you escape on purpose?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT shakes his head**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Did... did someone take you to a different location, either by force or through deception?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT suddenly raises his head to make eye contact with MANDO and nods**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Alright. Do you know the name of the individual or individuals that were involved?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT shakes his head repeatedly**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Do you remember their physical appearance, if it was recognizable?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT shakes his head again**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Hm. Was there anyone else whose appearance you can remember?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT nods**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Were they recognizable?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT looks to the ceiling and nods**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Alright. It is quite inconvenient that you cannot talk, you know? That&#39;d make things easier and more precise, but don&#39;t worry, I think I have something that might help us by now. Just wait a minute.}}

{{//**[**MANDO wakes up and exits the room to talk with a UIU Agent, who leaves quickly**]**//}}

{{//**[**MANDO enters the room again, and sits**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** This shouldn&#39;t take long, Hutchinson.}}

{{//**[**Three minutes later, the Agent enters the room and hands MANDO a couple of paper sheets and a black pen**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Thank you, Cooper, what would I do without you?}}

{{//**[**COOPER nods and leaves, MANDO clears his throat**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** So, Hutchinson, we&#39;ll be making this. I have this &#34;reference&#34; sheet with several human features, and you&#39;ll tell me which ones does the subject you&#39;re referring to has and which ones do they not. Alright?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT nods**]**//}}

{{//**[**MANDO shows the sheet to SUBJECT and points to a particular feature. SUBJECT shakes his head. This continues with both sheets**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** And that&#39;d be it. Alright. So, the subject you saw is an apparently tall woman, blonde hair, blue eyes, an inverted triangular face with no notable marks. Had pearl earrings, was wearing all blue clothes, and had a blue hat. Is this correct?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT nods several times**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Ok. We&#39;ll try to search for somebody with those characteristics, although we might need some more information that we cannot obtain at this moment. Now, do you remember what happened during your time absent?}}

{{//**[**Silence**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** I repeat. Do you remember what happened during your time absent?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT shakes his head**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** No? Not at all? You don&#39;t remember anything?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT negates**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Alright. Is this, or do you think this, might be related to your current state or is, whatever that may have happened during that time, related to your current state?}}

{{//**[**SUBJECT nods**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** I see.}}

{{//**[**MANDO gets up from his chair**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** Alright, Hutchinson. That&#39;d be it for the interrogatory. Thank you very much for your cooperation; we&#39;ll be investigating the subject you&#39;ve mentioned and will try to carry out more interrogation sessions to figure out what happened, whenever we&#39;ll be able to.}}

{{//**[**MANDO walks towards the exit door and half opens it**]**//}}

{{**MANDO:** As requested by Ambassador Lucy Fern√°ndez, we&#39;ll be transferring you to the GOC&#39;s jurisdiction shortly, and--}}

{{//**[**Special Agent KILROY looks out into the room**]**//}}

{{**KILROY:** Hey, is everything okay?}}

{{**MANDO:** Yeah, yeah... everything&#39;s alright, SUBJECT&#39;s just having another... aggressive episode, but as long as he&#39;s restrained, there shouldn&#39;t be any problem. Plus, we&#39;re going to transfer him to a //Gock// **[sic]** headquarters soon, so, more of the same. They should be here sometime soon.}}

= **EVENT DESCRIPTION**

A pagan-satanic ritual carried out by six teens between 18 and 22 years old, on November 2nd, 1935.

The exact nature of the ritual is unknown, but the inside appearance of the building from where the group came out indicates that a summoning ritual was taking place, and it most likely allowed one or more devilish spirits to take over their minds and bodies, as the teens were acting in a violent and erratic manner, attacking every person they saw, unable to be reasoned with.

= **HISTORY**

We obtained knowledge of the incident the same night it occurred. A group of Adventist Initiative Members was heading home after the end of a congregation, a few hours after sunset, when they spotted a building shining a heavy red light through the front door, which was ajar.

The brothers approached the building carried away by intrigue, and not far from there they saw six young figures walking in the direction of a nearby park. At the time they did not give it importance, not believing that they could be involved, and proceeded to observe the interior of the place, being left horrified to see a large number of symbols, figures, and altars dedicated to the evil one.

A couple of parishioners took a few photos of the site to present to a higher-ranking member of the Initiative to make sure it was a true pagan place of worship.

While this was happening, the group was interrupted when they heard horrible screams coming from far away. Alarmed, they approached the place where the screams came from, which turned out to be the park to which the aforementioned young people were heading. After arriving, they saw the group of teens trying to attack some passersby in an extremely aggressive and violent way.

A couple of sisters tried to intervene, but the group&#39;s aggressiveness was such that this was not possible due to the probable risk of being injured, so they limited themselves to observing the boys&#39; actions in dismay. On the other hand, the people they were trying to attack tried to defend themselves and scare them away, without much success, as it seemed that each movement they made further fanned the flame of violence in them as if they were rabid dogs.

With no choice but to get away, passersby who had the misfortune to come face to face with the group simply fled in terror, screaming for help as they saw their luminous eyes in a reddish aura, similar to the one seen inside the blasphemous building. Upon seeing them, the parishioners concluded that, indeed, they were under the power of some malicious entity.

Shortly after, the police arrived, alerted by the screams and calls for help from the people. His scandalous arrival upset and scared the teens, who appeared disoriented and howled at the slightest provocation. It was not long before they noticed the presence of the police and attacked them, which would end up costing them their lives.

The officers ordered them to put their hands up and stay still, but they just didn&#39;t seem to be able to understand what they were being told, and they kept getting closer and faster until they got too close and the policemen shot them down quickly. Then the brothers rushed to the scene.

The police force did not allow them to get too close to avoid contaminating the scene, nor to take photographs due to the sensitive nature of it, so it was not possible to obtain close evidence of the young people, except for photographs previously taken of them, which were rare.

According to the testimony of the several brothers who were present at the event, the reddish eyes of the teenagers stopped glowing as soon as they were shot by the police. During the short time they were close, they noticed that some of them had serious and terrible wound marks, such as scratches and bites, around the face, shoulders, and hands, although it is believed that they could be present in other parts of the body covered by their clothes.

However, it was observed that despite this, none of the boys showed the slightest trace of blood, neither in previous wounds nor in those caused by the bullets. Stranger still, several parishioners claimed that three young ones had what appeared to be two deep-prick marks on the sides of their necks, and they couldn&#39;t explain what might have caused them.

It was not long before the police did not allow the group of parishioners to be at the scene, so they had to return home in dismay. The next day, the bodies were no longer found, and the police claimed to be working on the case to determine what had happened but refused to receive the testimony of the parishioners, saying that they did not want to influence the course of the investigation or the relatives of those affected with non-sense religious ideas.

Later, it was announced that the youths in the incident had acted under the influence of drugs and hallucinogenic substances, which was not consistent with what happened in the event. Outraged, a few parishioners began the task of searching and trying to discover the names and families of the teens involved in an attempt to tell them the truth of the events.

After a relatively short search, the names of the six young ones were found to be Dandre Taylor, Louis Wilson, Michael King, Cindy Lewis, Sabrina Reyes, and Beatriz Portelli. Their parents were contacted, who flatly refused to believe that their kids had participated in a diabolical ritual, and branded the siblings as liars, even though they had shown them photographs of the building. Some even threatened the parishioners with denouncing them for slander, so they decided not to continue with the matter.

To this day, the Initiative firmly believes the event that occurred that 1935 Saturday night was, indeed, a satanic ritual, and fully condemns the incredulity of those who were involved and refused to listen to the Initiative&#39;s words.

__**SUMMARY:**__ //Three human subjects, identified as ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ‚ñà. ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, and ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, with Class 1 reality-bending qualities. Said subjects presented glowing red eyes, notably fragile skin and unusually dense blood, as well as aggressive behavior. None of the subjects were able to talk, despite being able to babble, scream, and emit other non-anomalous noises.//
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-left: solid 6px #8b0000;&#34;]]
__**DISCOVERY:**__ //URA-2616 was first discovered on June ‚ñà‚ñàth, 1985, when Site-‚ñà‚ñà&#39;s in-situ Kant Counters detected Hume interferences in the vicinity of the facility. These interferences slightly increased in the next 3 minutes, which led several Onthotics and Ontology Department Researchers to believe this abnormality could be caused by an ontokinetic entity or phenomenon.//

//A small Containment Team was sent to the area where the interference was believed to come from, resulting in the discovery of URA-2616 and their subsequent capture.//
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-left: solid 6px #8b0000;&#34;]]
__**INITIAL TEST LOG:**__
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-right: solid 6px #8b0000;&#34;]]
//**TEST #1**//

//**PROCEDURE:** The three subjects were exposed to a Scranton Reality Anchor.//

//**PURPOSE:** Properly calibrate a Scranton Reality Anchor according to the subjects&#39; capacities.//

//**RESULT:** The subjects&#39; Hume levels were found to correspond with those of a Class 1 Reality Bender.//
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-right: solid 6px #8b0000;&#34;]]
//**TEST #3**//

//**PROCEDURE:** URA-2616-B was sedated and restrained. No Scranton Reality Anchors were activated due to the nature of the Test, but three were deployed inactive to be used in case of emergency.//

//**PURPOSE:** Scan URA-2616-B&#39;s body with a Kant Counter to determine if the source of his anomalous qualities is related to his anatomy. --Testing on this is pending--.//

//**RESULT:** The Kant Counter readings showed that the subject&#39;s {{[REDACTED]}} displayed an abnormally high Hume level. It is believed subject&#39;s {{[REDACTED]}} could be the responsible of its reality-bending capacities.//
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-right: solid 6px #8b0000;&#34;]]
//**TEST #6**//

//**PROCEDURE:** Feed a Class-D personnel member (D-2580 proposed for the Test due to her loyalty to the Foundation) with {{[REDACTED]}}. Three Scranton Reality Anchors, calibrated with the parameters obtained during TEST #1, were installed in the Test Room as a preventive measure.//

//**PURPOSE:** Determine if ingesting {{[REDACTED]}} can provoke abnormal qualities.//

//**RESULT:** D-2580 ingested 5ml of {{[REDACTED]}}, and mentioned it had a slight blackcurrant flavor. After two minutes, D-2580 reported to be feeling strange; when questioned, she declared to feel dizzy and getting her vision slightly blurred. This was attributed to the effect of the Anchors on D-2580.//

//The Reality Anchors were turned off, and D-2580 was instructed to mildly modify reality in her surroundings. Her abilities corresponded to those of a Class 1 Reality Bender. When the Anchors were activated again, D-2580 lost the capacity to modify reality.//

__**INCIDENT LOG:**__

//Five minutes after the beginning of Test #6, it was reported that URA-2616-B, the subject whose {{[REDACTED]}} was extracted for the said test, presented sudden cardiac and respiratory difficulties. He was quickly transferred to the Site&#39;s Medical Bay but died shortly after.//

//Immediately after URA-2616-B&#39;s death, a powerful Hume interference was detected to come from the Test Room. It was found to emanate from D-2580 despite the presence of the active Scranton Reality Anchors and broke out of the chamber, completely destroying the Anchors and killing several personnel members present in the room.//

//Mobile Task Force Theta-11 (&#34;No Way Out&#34;) was sent to neutralize D-2580 as soon as possible, as Kant Counter readings indicated her Hume levels were corresponding to those of a Class 4 Reality Bender.//

//Once the current location of D-2580 was identified, Theta-11 deployed a [[[SCP-4830|Scranton Guillotine]]] in the area to kill the subject, successfully managing to do so, but accidentally eliminating URA-2616-A and URA-2616-C as well.//

//Subsequent analysis of the cadavers revealed that all of the subjects&#39; {{[REDACTED]}} had lost their abnormal Hume levels after their death. The corpses of URA-2616 and D-2580 were subjected to acroamatic abatement procedures and stored in a cryogenic chamber located in Site-‚ñà‚ñà&#39;s H Wing, along with all the {{[REDACTED]}} samples.//

&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** Oh, I&#39;m at-- Wait, where are //you//?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** For God&#39;s sake Ciruela, are you in the Library or are you not!?
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** Jesus, calm down, Moly! I&#39;m not at the Library. Why are you asking it like this?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** //[Sigh]// The Library was attacked 10 minutes ago. I expected you to be at the Library as well, but couldn&#39;t find you anywhere, and no one had seen you around either.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** Say again? The Library was what!?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** It was attacked. We don&#39;t know how, but six people-- I&#39;d like to think they&#39;re people, entered the Library. We believe they could have been got there through one of the Toci[[footnote]] Presumably a codename used by members of the Wanderers&#39; Library. It is currently unknown whether is it used to designate Ways in general, or a Way or a set of Ways in particular. [[/footnote]] from the South-East section, but we are not sure yet. They made a whole mess.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** My God. Are you OK?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** Yes. Fortunately, I&#39;m not hurt, but I&#39;m nervous. My hands are all cold and sweaty.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** Good, good. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re unscathed. Tell me, what exactly happened?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** It all happened so fast. One moment, I was just sitting there, talking with Pummelo, and the next one, we all were running for our lives. It was so quiet, some chattering or other quiet noises in the background, and then we hear screaming.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** Screaming?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** Yes. They seem to have entered the Library in a rush or something. We raised our looks, quite confused before they broke into the room like a soul fleeing from the devil.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** Do you think they were running from something?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** I don&#39;t know. When I realized, they were coming my way, pushing people away to clear the path, I guess. They also threw some books to the floor and ran over them, if suddenly enter running and screaming wasn&#39;t enough.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** Oh no.
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** Yeah. We knew they were going to be fucked the moment they did that, but... we were wrong. A couple of Wanderers got in their way and tried to stop one of them, and then-- then the person attacked both.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** What? How?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** Well, he just... turned around, pounced on one of them, and threw them to the ground. Then, started to bite them and try to rip their skin or something. The other Wanderer tried to help, but couldn&#39;t really do anything.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** Didn&#39;t anyone else try to do //something//?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** We were told to get away as soon as possible, a Librarian was coming. And you know how messy can that get. So one was rushing its way to the scene and found the other five people running right towards it.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Moluna coughs]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** We expected them to stop, or try to go back, but they just kept running in a straight line. I don&#39;t think they knew exactly what were they seeing in front of them, or could have processed it. At least, not at the moment. When they got too close, the Librarian just... extended one of its appendages and... crushed the person&#39;s head.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Moluna snaps]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** Just like that. I never expected to see a Librarian kill somebody. Quickly, the other guys panicked and ran away, all in different directions. Causing more mess, of course. We panicked too, a little bit, and headed to one of the South-East Toci to exit the Library and allow the corresponding people to take care of the issue.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** Which Toci did you used?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** Toci Sol. But, let me finish. We all were running there, and then we found the guy that started everything. Apparently, he also ran away when the Librarian killed the person, and we thought he was trying to escape. We did our best to get him-- don&#39;t you think we were that many, we were no more than 10 people. It was at that moment when I could see him better.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** What was the matter with him?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** He looked awful. Not only was he covered in a green goo-- the Wanderer&#39;s &#34;blood&#34;, but he also had a terrible appearance. Dirty, with lots of wounds and blood, which was pretty noticeable, as he was wearing a white shirt. He also had these... beige military boots and jeans. Stained with blood, too.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** Oh, God. Why was he so covered in blood?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** I&#39;m not sure, but I&#39;d say it was because of his wounds. They seemed to be recent, none of them had cicatrized yet. He also had a, uh, blue kerchief on his neck, and it wasn&#39;t stained. But the worst of all were his eyes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** What&#39;s with them?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** They were red. And they were glowing. I swear they were glowing. I hadn&#39;t noticed before, as the Library hallway had good lighting, but in the dark of the room we got him, I could clearly see a reddish light coming out of it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** //Ay//. Didn&#39;t anyone else notice?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** Yes, we all did. We were going to beat him up, but we saw that and thought something was wrong. After all, people&#39;s eyes don&#39;t glow under normal circumstances, do they? One of the people that were with us did, uh, //something//. I don&#39;t know what it was, but she said the guy was under... an influence.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** Influence? What does that mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** She said she felt a... force controlling him. A strong force, indeed, but didn&#39;t explain what kind of force it was. We thought this &#34;force&#34; could be the reason why they were so aggressive, but... I mean, what kind of force can be so destructive and yet be able to access the Library?
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** What about the Jailors? I think they have some sort of [[[task-forces#sigma-3|cell]]] that can access the Library.
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** This is different. The Jailors can be whatever you want, but they don&#39;t do this kind of thing. Not even on a proportional level. Or so I like to think. I also thought of the Bookburners, but they&#39;re completely out of the Library, and they&#39;ll never enter again. It had to be... something else. If I were to bet, I&#39;d say it could be something... related to //other// kind of entities. He looked like he was... possessed by a... demon or something.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** Do you think it could be something like that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** I&#39;m not sure. We tried to ask the guy something about it; if he was feeling alright or anything, but he just wouldn&#39;t answer. Only noises, like laments, but not a single phrase. He was still able to think, as he could nod or shake his head when we asked him questions that could be answered with &#34;yes&#34; or &#34;no&#34;, but no word came out of his mouth.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** What did you do with him, then?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** We had a Librarian to help us restrain him. I&#39;m still recovering from the whole situation, but when I feel better, I&#39;ll be getting to the bottom of this. I need to know what the hell just happened.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** Are you going to do what I think you&#39;re going to do?
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** Extra-sensorial communication? Yes. I&#39;ve done it a couple of times, should be able to do it a third time. If not, I have some friends that might help me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** //Ay//, Moluna. I will never get tired of telling you how crazy I think you are. Be careful, it can be dangerous.
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** Don&#39;t worry, Ciru. I&#39;ll be careful.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ciruela:** I know you will. Got to go, see you later!
&gt; 
&gt; **Moluna:** Bye!

##dfedfa| Ever since that happened, I&#39;ve been feeling strange. I don&#39;t even remember what it was, and every time I force myself to think about it I only get blurry visions with nothing but silhouettes, as if a piece of my mind had been taken away. ##

##dfedfa| The only thing I still remember as clear as water is the shape of a woman; her golden hair, brighter than gold itself, and blue eyes, more appealing than a diamond. Behind her, an orange light and a burning heat I assumed to be fire. ##

##dfedfa| But it must have been a mere product of my mind, as I have never seen her, and I don&#39;t think I ever will. Besides, it&#39;s the only thing I can barely remember; why can&#39;t I bring back the memories of anything else that may have happened? ##

##dfedfa| Maybe it was the shape an angel itself took to present before me. Ever since that day, I have been descending into madness and despair. I don&#39;t know where I am, nor the day or month. Suddenly, I feel as if something was taking control over me, and I disconnect from reality. ##

##dfedfa| When that happens, I just see blue shades. Clean light blue skies with blue silhouettes roaming around. Sometimes, I see stars in white. I wonder what does it mean if it means something. But before I can think about it, reality emerges and crushes my brain. ##

##dfedfa| Ever since then, I dream in gray and cry in red. Ever since that day, the haunting image of the lady in blue with her five-pointed white star chases me in my dreams, turning them blue. ##

##dfedfa| And, who knows? Maybe one day she will emerge from my mind and will catch me in my sleep. ##

Hi. I&#39;m not really into forums or the like, but I feel I have to tell someone about this.

I had never believed in the supernatural, or those old stories about rituals and witches, but I think I&#39;ve changed my mind after what happened last night.

A friend of mine invited me to hangover at a Halloween party in an abandoned big old cabin. You know, the typical &#34;let&#39;s get scared but we&#39;ll end up drunk instead!&#34;. It had been a while since I attended a party, so I decided to go with him. It was around 4 pm when he came to my house, driving a black Ford Explorer, to pick me up.

We drove straight for, like, half an hour through a forest, then arrived at a rustic field, next to a river. The cabin was big and didn&#39;t really look abandoned; maybe they cleaned up a little before the party. It was actually nice, people were drinking, dancing, and chilling; don&#39;t know why I had the sensation I didn&#39;t want to be there. Everything was quite cool until someone entered and brought, like, 20 pizza boxes, and none of it was mushroom pizza.

When I realized, it was 9:50 pm and had to leave. Plus, the party was getting a little bit wild; some people brought drugs, some of them were way too drunk, others had started to argue, and I didn&#39;t want to stay to see how it turned out.

I told my friend to go, but he didn&#39;t want to. He said he wanted to stay a little longer, and knowing him, that &#34;little longer&#34; was going to be another 3 hours or even more. I asked him to call a taxi or something but was probably too drunk to do so, and my phone was dead. I didn&#39;t know anyone else there, so I had the stupid idea of trying to go back on my own.

I could have easily stayed there for a while, or insisted on my friend so much he&#39;d get tired of me and would call someone to pick me up, but I was drunk too and quite annoyed.

So there I was, walking in the middle of the woods at 10 o&#39;clock at night. I had no signal to call anyone, and I was pretty much lost, as I didn&#39;t really know where the hell was I going. I looked back one last time, to make sure I was on the right way and realized how quiet it appeared to be on the outside. The whole structure was trembling inside to the rhythm of &#34;Thriller&#34;, but no sound came out of it.

It wasn&#39;t too late to backtrack and stay in the cabin, but I wasn&#39;t thinking clearly at that moment. My only thought was to get out of there, and it still is today, even though I&#39;m not there anymore.

What seemed to be hours passed, and I wasn&#39;t getting anywhere. I even thought I was walking in circles. Almost by mere instinct, I started running in a desperate attempt to advance forward, but it felt as if I was staying in the same place.

I was almost about to cry, thinking I was completely lost, when I heard some voices. Couldn&#39;t really recognize them, but I heard voices. I thought it was a trick of my mind, but I heard them again, and I saw some light coming from there.

I sighed quite relieved, thinking I had found a remote house in which I could stay until the Sun rose up again. But, when I got closer, I could hear... cries. There was no house; instead, the light seemed to come from the ground. I carefully walked towards it, trying to see through the undergrowth, and looked.

Shocked, I observed what seemed to be a ritual. There were five people, tied to large stakes, forming a star-like shape in the ground. In each point, right next to the people, were candles that emitted a heavy light, almost blinding. I could also swear the people&#39;s eyes were glowing.

Right in the middle of the star, there was something I couldn&#39;t identify. It looked like a mirror, but with no reflection. Instead, it was completely dark. Even darker than the night sky. It wasn&#39;t long before I heard somebody else: a female voice saying things I couldn&#39;t understand.

And then I saw her. A really tall woman, around 6 feet I&#39;d say, slowly walking towards the people. She was wearing a blue coat, carried an umbrella, and had a dark hat on her head. I immediately wanted to run, but I couldn&#39;t. At the moment, I thought I was paralyzed with fear; my hands were cold and I was sweating profusely.

I tried to close my eyes, without success, as I saw her wielding a dagger. I didn&#39;t want to see how did she killed them, but it seemed I had no option. She started with the guy that was on the left bottom side of the star; grabbed the dagger, stabbed his chest, and smoothly slid it down until it reached his abdomen, undeterred by the poor man&#39;s screams.

She then slipped her finger through the wound, staining it with blood, and put it in her mouth. Almost immediately, she grabbed him and bite his neck, apparently killing him instantly, as it looked she was drinking his blood. She stayed like that for a while, before untying the person, making him suddenly fall to the ground, dead.

I was grossed out and wanted to vomit, but I contained myself as I didn&#39;t want to be discovered. She did the same with the rest of them, going clockwise. With every person she killed, I wanted to run, but I couldn&#39;t. Then I came to the realization she probably knew I was there and was forcing me to watch what she was doing before coming to get me.

Thankfully, she didn&#39;t. Slowly, once the last man was dead, she took her hat off, allowing me to see her bright blue eyes that seemed to shine along with the moonlight. Then, the object in the middle started to smoke, as something bright began to expand from the ground. It suddenly opened from side to side, with a strong light that almost blinded me.

When I could see, she was still there, but some figures had appeared. They had long blue hoods with a symbol, but I couldn&#39;t clearly see it due to the smoke. I think they were waiting for her, as they said something unintelligible and bowed. She nodded slightly, and entered the &#34;portal&#34;.

It closed really quickly, but I could see the other side. It was like an office, with computers and equipment. Far behind, there were big windows, and, if I didn&#39;t know any better, I&#39;d have said the landscape looked just like Manhattan.

I don&#39;t know how I got to my house, but I found myself sweating and crying on my couch almost immediately after, then realized the day was breaking. I didn&#39;t tell anyone about this, as I was doubting it was a dream. I tried to convince myself it was a dream, but I&#39;m sure it was real, and I don&#39;t know how to feel about it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever forget what happened that night.
