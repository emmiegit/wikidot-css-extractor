Lately I&#39;ve had a fear well up
One that I never had before
Viscously prowling in dark corners
Enter stage left, a soliloquy in a bland grey

Reminiscing on the past
Once, even once, but none come to mind
Misses come and gone, water flowing endlessly
And the match never struck to flame
Not that I&#39;m stone, I hope
Certainly, I do feel, but
Emotions can seem to be built by Daedalus

I&#39;ve heard it from all corners of the Earth, there&#39;s
Nothing to worry about because
There //just isn&#39;t.//
It&#39;s something that you //know//
Missives pouring forth like syrup
All I have to rely on is
Coy testimony about vague
Yearnings and emotions

If the match strikes
Neon blood pouring onto a dim street, is
There any chance I realize that I&#39;m drowning?
Exit stage right, a Tartaglia in purple
Reaped rewards after so much neglect
Thrown out simply for being
Worrisome and unwanted
Ignored to avoid being a bother
Now the water boils and froths
Effervescent and dyed to meet expectations but
Denial has left me colorblind

Rotating gears in a clock, weaving tales
Oil slipping through the mechanisms
Sensible and rational
Envoys of a limbic matriarch are dirt
Gum, flesh, salty water corroding
Obstructions and halts, cracks and creaks
Left alone to my own devices I struggle
Doomed to ignorance

To think that it may have happened already
Weightless words laden with honey float gently
Ostensibly murdered by blunt force trauma

Will I know when it happens
Asinine ears, gradient thoughts
Restlessly drug elsewhere
Minute details sinking into
The deep, briny drink
Hereafter left to rot</textarea></pre>
