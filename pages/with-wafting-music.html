[[collapsible show=&#34;One wrong turn and suddenly...&#34; hide=&#34;you&#39;re somewhere else:&#34;]]

A green field framed by a thick tree line, only one clear trail leading into it, at the head of which you stand. Sitting in the center is a small, worn playground that rests on a circle of mulch. A large black walnut tree sprouts out from the middle, rising up high and reaching out so widely that the whole playground is dimmed by its shade.

As you walk closer to the little playground, passing an old swing set, and stepping onto the mulch meant to keep falling children from getting too hurt-- though no children have been here in decades-- you take note of the wood it&#39;s comprised of: old, dark brown planks that seem on the brink of beginning to rot, but that never pass the threshold..

From an open window with a wind chime hanging off of its sill, cut into the house-esque portion of the playground, music quietly spills out, filling in the gaps between the breeze whistling in your ears and complete silence.

You consider the ladder for a moment, before feeling drawn to the climbing wall, a wall of the dark wood with planks jutting out symmetrically. It creaks under your weight but you find you aren&#39;t concerned, much to your own surprise.

Having arrived at the top, you lean into the play house and see a young man sitting crisscross in a corner, a nearby speaker the source of the music. He sits hunched over a small desk sitting in his lap, writing fervently on a piece of loose-leaf paper. He&#39;s so engrossed in the task that he doesn&#39;t notice you peeking in.

You gently clear your throat, trying your best to not spook him, but he nonetheless jolts up and stares at you with wide eyes. No longer hunched over, you can see that he&#39;s a bit of a mess. His shirt is crumpled up, his hair is greasy and uncombed, and he hasn&#39;t shaved in a few weeks. The man quickly composes himself, trying to straighten out his shirt, hands running over an ugly tie.

&#34;Sorry, didn&#39;t see you there,&#34; he says as he stands up, walking over and reaching out his hand to shake. &#34;I&#39;m Linus. Good to meet you. Don&#39;t see people out here all too often.&#34; You politely shake his hand, trying to ignore the sweat on it.

Linus walks back to his corner, sliding down the wall onto the floor. &#34;Welcome to my little corner of the world! [*https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/linus-daglen-is-a-hack I don&#39;t leave here all that much] so you&#39;ll have to forgive my, uh,&#34; he looks down at the floor and picks up a walnut, &#34;Hospitality, I suppose. Mostly just spend my time here writing whatever comes to mind.&#34; He points to the opposite corner where a stack of loose-leaf papers sit, a rock weighing them down. &#34;Feel free to stay as long as you want.&#34;

You move to the pile of loose-leaf papers and begin shuffling through the writings. The rough chicken scratch is all in pen, mistakes scribbled out and littered with smudges.

Linus continues to fiddle with the walnut, seemingly oblivious to your presence once more (or maybe avoiding it?)

&#34;It&#39;s an odd duck. I see what you&#39;re going for, and it&#39;s an interesting angle, but ultimately I find myself of a mind with uncanny — except I&#39;m not quite so fond of pure-vibes articles. I just… Hm. I think that the translation of what music makes us feel to words is certainly a noble and interesting take on the theme, but it&#39;s also a very uphill battle, by nature of what you&#39;re trying to do. For most of the article I felt more confused than anything, the experience and emotion just didn&#39;t come across to me the way it felt like it was supposed to.&#34;

&#34;This is the first and only WL work — or any work, for that matter — thus far to set as a soldier in war that I have enjoyed, and boy did this suck me in like a shark down a whirlpool. This prose is dramatic and descriptive and evocative and wet with imagery, and this author&#39;s sense of senses beyond the eyes is simply gorgeous. The use of temperature and bodily strain are astounding here, too — heat and disease and grogginess and boredom and festering emotions not yet felt are splendid and kept beneath the sheet but felt so very clearly without needing to be told, like a porcupine sneaking into your bed at midnight. Only thing is that I would have liked to see a little more what-why and development of the augmentations of the narrator, but that&#39;s the tiniest nitpick in the world — a particular speck of dust in the great rock-gem swathes of Saturn&#39;s rings. This work tastes of fragrant canned fermented salmon jerky and it is a memory the tastebuds cannot live without.&#34;

Howdy, I&#39;m AKAM80 (or AKA-M80, depends on the platform), previously known as Papa Gelatin. I changed it because I thought the name was stupid and I found that the &#34;papa&#34; part of it could be a tad uncomfortable at times.

In reality, I&#39;m a guy from Alabama, USA, currently studying Cyber Crime and writing for the hell of it because I need a creative outlet. I don&#39;t have the classical Southern accent, but my use of &#34;ain&#39;t,&#34; &#34;y&#39;all,&#34; and some double negatives in casual conversation betrays my home turf.

Not sure what else to put here. Just felt that I needed a smattering of the real me outside of the intra-universe image/character/author or whatever you want to call it.

I got called a tortured artist once. Not sure how to feel about that.
