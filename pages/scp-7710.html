**Item #:** SCP-7710

**Object Class:** Pending

**Temporary Containment Procedures:** SCP-7710 is temporaily located at Auxillary Research Facility-19. SCP-7710 is to be contained in a large biohazardous containment cell retrofitted for a large animal. Its cell is to be lined with common industrial plastic with imprinted thaumaturgic sigils. SRAs[[footnote]]Scranton Reality Anchor, stablizes local reality.[[/footnote]] are to be placed at the corners of the containment cell. Use of fire is approved in re-containing the anomaly. Personnel are required to wear hazardous material suits while in SCP-7710&#39;s cell. Testing temporary sigils must be made with a liquid mixture 1:7:10 ratio of silver dust:salt:blood (unspecified).

**Description:** SCP-7710 is a biohazardous entity retrieved from the Saginaw Bay in Bay City, Michigan, USA. The entity will take on the appearance of an extinct, extinct in the wild, or critically endangered species. Its current form is a black rhinoceros. SCP-7710 is three times the size of its non-anomalous counterparts. The anomaly&#39;s mass is made up of biohazardous and acidic slime; it has an exo-skeleton composed of oxidized iron and copper. At this time, no specific cause for SCP-7710&#39;s manifestation has been found.

In testing, SCP-7710 has been found to emit low levels of TRE.[[footnote]]Tartarean Resonance Energy.[[/footnote]]

**Mordecai:** Hi.

**Cornell:** How are we feeling today?

**Mordecai:** Tired mostly.

**Cornell:** Are the insomnia medications not working?

**Mordecai:** I&#39;m having a hard time taking them.

**Cornell:** I can see about getting a liquid form. (removes a notebook and pen)

**Mordecai:** No, no. That&#39;s not the problem.

**Cornell:** (pauses) What&#39;s the problem Mordecai?

**Mordecai:** I (rubs forehead) don&#39;t want to sleep.

**Cornell:** Why&#39;s that?

**Mordecai:** It means the day&#39;s over, and I&#39;ve lost another day.

**Cornell:** &#34;Lost another day&#34;?

**Mordecai:** I don&#39;t want to get more in depth.

**Cornell:** Mordecai, if this is affecting your work, by default we should know.

[Mordecai is silent for a minute.]

**Mordecai:** It&#39;s another day gone knowing that I did have housing. I wake up the next morning and worry I won&#39;t have housing when I lay down again. And the cycle repeats.

[Dr. Cornell puts his pen down. Mordecai shifts nervously.]

**Mordecai:** If I can stay awake, I won&#39;t end the feeling that I made it through another day.

[The room remains silent for about a minute. Dr. Cornell retrieves his pen, and writes something down.]

**Cornell:** From what I understand, you have an apartment near here that&#39;s in your name?

**Mordecai:** (sniffs) Yes.

**Cornell:** You pay the rent?

**Mordecai:** Yes... but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to pay it the next month, and the next month, and the next month.

**Cornell:** You have solid employment with the Foundation. 

**Mordecai:** I&#39;m aware, I just can&#39;t shake the feeling that everything can come crashing down on me.

**Cornell:** Your anxiety sounds overwhelming. We can try upping your anti-anxiety medications and see how that helps?

09:32: Testing commences on SCP-7710. The entity melts into corium.

09:33: The blast shields protect the researchers from the sudden radioactive burst. Containment Specialist Samson alerts the facility to a containment breach.

09:35: All personnel begin evacuating.

09:43: Jr. Researcher Mordecai trips and falls down. He tends to his ankle.

09:47: SCP-7710 breaches containment. Its original biohazardous exoskeleton has grown back. It ceases emitting radioactivity.

09:48: Mordecai weakly stands up and hobbles down the hall.

09:51: SCP-7710 sluggishly crawls down the hallway, still recovering from the meltdown.

09:55-10:04: Hopping into an empty conference room, Mordecai stretches his ankle. He pulls out a tube of eyeliner and writes around the bruise while ##gold|muttering##.

10:05: Roaring is reported to come from Temporary Containment Wing-B. Mordecai stands and flexes his ankle. He evacuates the conference room and heads toward the security checkpoint.

10:07: SCP-7710 barges down the hall, and into the open office floor. Despite Mordecai&#39;s prior injuries, he is able to run down the next hallway. The anomaly barrels after Mordecai.

10:08-10:15: The entity launches its biohazardous sludge at the researcher. The researcher cups his mouth and ##gold|yells##. A wall of light appears before him. The sludge is absorbed by the wall. Mordecai appears to be ##gold|speaking## while launching thaumaturgically charged spheres at SCP-7710, which explode on impact. The wall disapates. Recovering from the explosives, SCP-7710 continues to pursue Mordecai.

10:15: Mordecai reaches the security checkpoint. The vault doors are locked. The researcher uses the checkpoint intercom.

------

__Intercom Recording__

------

**Mordecai:** Anyone there?

**Security:** Yes. We aren&#39;t able to open the doors until SCP-7710 is re-contained. Please stand-by, there is a mobile task force on route to the site.

[Loud bellowing is heard through the intercom.]

**Mordecai:** Shit shit shit shit shit...

**Security:** Get yourself to safety and wait for rescue.

[The bellowing gets louder. Mordecai ends the call.]

------

__Security Footage (Video Only)__

------

10:18-10:23: The researcher turns and faces the anomaly again. Mordecai removes his lab coat, and rolls up his sleeves. He pulls out the tube of eyeliner again and frantically scrawls on both forearms. SCP-7710 launches refuse at Mordecai. The researcher&#39;s eyes begin glowing as he waves his hands, manifesting a wall of light. It absorbs the attack.

10:24-10:35: Mordecai strafes left. The entity rams into the doors. The researcher&#39;s eyes glow brighter and light begins to outline Mordecai&#39;s body. SCP-7710 recovers and appears to bellow. Mordecai ##gold|yells## and a shortbow made out of light appears in his hand. He points it at SCP-7710. Pulling on the string Mordecai manifests an arrow. He quickly lets out 3 arrows. The entity writhes as the arrows embed into its exposed flesh. Mordecai ##gold|whispers## into his left hand, summoning another thaumaturgical explosive orb. Throwing it in the direction of SCP-7710, Mordecai sprints and ducks behind a trash can. The footage washes out for a minute.

10:37-10:43: SCP-7710 recovers. There are two new cracks in its exoskeleton; it leaks crude oil. Mordecai de-summons the shortbow, centers his weight and begins to dance. The anomaly bombards Mordecai with refuse. The researcher&#39;s ##gold|mouth moves## as he extends his arms above his head. Light around Mordecai expands. A thick, wall of plasma expands and atomizes the refuse. Mordecai is overexposed for the rest of the footage.

[On site temperature read outs report an average increase of 5C site wide at this time. Containment Wing-B reports an increase of 7C.]

10:46-10:51: The anomaly struggles, dragging its mass toward the security checkpoint. Mordecai rushes toward SCP-7710. Light levels increase around Mordecai as he approaches the entity. An appendage flows out of him and makes a large fist. Upon impact with SCP-7710 Mordecai punches it. There is another bright flash and a report of an increase in heat. The rest of the footage is corrupted.

__Medical Report 7710.1__

After gaining lucidity, Jr. Researcher Mordecai loudly requested drawing material and a meeting with Dr. Cornell, and Containment Specialist Samson.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

__**Debriefing**__
 
Patient: Jr. Researcher Mordecai Ryder
Attending: Dr. Haskell Cornell, Containment Specialist Sif Samson
Date: 2022/11/25

**Mordecai:** (pulls out an envelope and hands it to Samson) These are plans for a gravity sigil that will anchor 7710. I can&#39;t be there to activate it, and the blueprint is incomplete; however, that sigil should give off enough passive emissions to hold the entity in place while I heal.

**Samson:** (takes the envelope) How do you know this&#39;ll work?

**Mordecai:** Because it already worked to recontain it. I need to speak to Dr. Cornell alone now.

**Samson:** Alright, we&#39;ll begin work immediately.

[Samson leaves the room.]

**Cornell:** Tell me what you remember.

**Mordecai:** Something went wrong with the sigil, and 7710 melted into nuclear sludge. Thankfully the blast shields were up, (wheezes) I tripped while evacuating and twisted my ankle. I don&#39;t remember much from then to when the rhino rushed me.

**Cornell:** Try to remember your fight with the rhino.

[Silence for roughly 2 minutes.]

**Mordecai:** I remember writing ##gold|PSALMS##...something, on my forearm, and ##gold|GUIDANCE## on the other. (pauses) There was yelling. The air around me got really hot and my skin started to burn. (shifts painfully) I wake up in here with an image in my mind&#39;s eye quickly fading. I don&#39;t recall much more.

**Cornell:** (nods) I&#39;ll speak with your supervisor on getting you access to the security footage.

**Mordecai:** Sweet Lord have mercy-- I don&#39;t think I can handle that just yet.

**Cornell:** Of course, but I feel we should get a move on with the paperwork.

**Mordecai:** (painfully shifts in bed) That&#39;s fair. Now, please let me be alone.

**Cornell:** Understood. Have a good night Mordecai.

**Mordecai:** You too. (wheezes)

Tyler,

Have you looked into financially compensating Mordecai for housing? He&#39;s shown himself more than capable in handling 7710&#39;s containment research and besides, he&#39;s been beat up enough already.

Sandra,

It&#39;s come to my attention that Jr. Researcher Mordecai Ryder has expressed on numerous occasions that his issues with housing are distracting him from work. With the difficulty of containing a refuse demon at a small facility, and Mordecai being the only thaumaturge on-site, I feel this warrants emergency measures. I propose that the facility takes over the rest of his lease.

Tyler,

What we&#39;ve allocated for ARF-19&#39;s budget wouldn&#39;t allow for this. Sadly, 7710&#39;s breaches have evaporated most of the funds.

15:32: Mordecai is seated at a table alone in the media center. He&#39;s surrounded by sigil blue prints, books, and binders. Dark circles are under his eyes.

15:41: He falls asleep.

16:02: The sigil blueprint Mordecai is laying on top of begins to glow.

16:04: Edges of the blueprint start to smolder.

16:20: The paper catches fire and this wakes Mordecai. He removes his lab coat and beats the flames.

16:24: Mordecai successfuly extinguishes the fire. He cleans the mess, packs his things, and leaves.

I reached out to the head of food service at ARF-19. We were able to free up some of the facility&#39;s budget. Attached is our proposal.

P.S. It&#39;ll mean a lesser quality of food on-site. But I feel that that&#39;s a fair compromise to reduce the frequency of the rhino&#39;s breaches.

I need to inform you that Auxillary Facility-19 will be taking over the rest of your apartment&#39;s lease. In the attached document is the relevent paperwork to fill out to apply for the emergency aid, as well as a list of what information your property management company needs to provide us with.

[…]i might&#39;ve been using entirely the wrong language in programming the base. its a demon, but no relataed language is working. but as a manifestation of pollution. am i crazy to think that the demon is closer to science than theology? im going to put in a request for material on basic environmental science and physics[…]

**Effects:** SCP-7710 biohazardous sludge begins to decay and slough off over the course of 48 hours.
