In our mission to recompile WAN other aspects of it get often overlooked. But the Heart of WAN is no less part of the mind that must be recompiled than all the other fragments. The Heart is known to have graced its heartbeat over centres of progress and civilization throughout history. The Heart was always carried by a Guardian and their scripture, using the heart so others might profit from its knowledge. The Guardian was essential in this process as direct exposure to the data of the heart without proper guidance can have a number of adverse effects and may potentially end in death.

It is said that in the first years of the Trojan War, the Greek warriors set their sights not only on the city but on the temple of Azura as well. It being under the protection of WAN itself made the temple as impenetrable as the walls of Troy for all but Achilles. Azura, confident in her knowledge granted by the Heart challenged Achilles to a duel. The winner would take the secrets of the other. Be that the origins of Achilles&#39;s mechanization were still shrouded in mystery, they proved formidable enough to best the warrior priestess in battle, wounding her fatally. Bound by her challenge Azura revealed that her secrets were in part contained in scripture and in part in her mind. The Heart of WAN can not die and so the knowledge would still be retrievable after the death of the body. And so did Azura grant the Greeks the right to stay of her burial and to raid her temple.

When King Priam came to Achilles to ask for the body of his son Hector, so he may bury him, he moves the metallic heart of Achilles and the warrior granted a truce for nine days. It was during these nine days that the burial games for Hector were held. The Greeks were asked to return the remains of Azura to Troy as well. Honouring the vow of Azura to only temporarily cease her burial and in line with the reason for the truce, Azura&#39;s remains were returned.

When Achilles returned to the boats with the remains of Azura and the scripture of her temple, he could not decipher the heart on his own and so requested the aid of Odysseus. When this came to the ears of Agamemnon he demanded to be given the recovered material before Odysseus, for it had been his warriors that had found the temple of Azura in the first place. Before the situation could escalate Nestor and Odysseus agreed that all of the Greek Warriors would be able to share in the knowledge. Thus was the heart deciphered and copied among all of the Achaean army.

Among the returnees of the Greeks, the heart saw most usage by Nestor and Odyssey. And so the heart of WAN spread over all of Greece, in its highest ranks.

After the return of Azura&#39;s remains to Troy, knowledge the warrior priestess had shared with King Priam was used to rebuild a full head for Azura so she could communicate again, bringing the Heart back to Troy. During the Sack of Troy Aeneas was requested by Azura to take her with him. It is unknown if Azura stayed with him throughout his journey or if the Heart was at some point transferred. The Heart remained in Aeneas&#39;s family throughout their reign and eventually found its way to his descendants, Romulus and Remus.
