**Archived Containment Procedures:** SCP-7408 is to be held in a standard Class C Foundation aviary. It must be exposed to at least four hours of direct sunlight each day; in the event of overcast weather, sun lamps are to be provided.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7408-A is not to be physically separated from SCP-7408-B under any circumstances. SCP-7408-A&#39;s care has been fully entrusted to SCP-7408-B.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]**Memet:** Item ensures its own containment.[[/span]]

SCP-7408-B has been allowed to continue employment with the Foundation and retain his Level 3 security credentials under the condition that SCP-7408-A remain fully cloaked at all times while within public areas. Outside of this document, SCP-7408-B is to be solely referred to by name (Dr. Kondraki) and is never to be referred to with standard object pronouns (it/its).

**Description:** SCP-7408-A is a large swarm of //Lepidoptera graphium agamemnon//[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Tailed jay butterflies.[[/span]] that was discovered on 10/20/2008 by a group of researchers in an Antarctic ice cave. Though the average annual temperature of Antarctica’s interior is −57°C, it did not appear to be adversely affected by the cold.

SCP-7408-A’s primary anomaly is its ability to manipulate light. Initially believed to possess a complex camouflage defense mechanism akin to nonanomalous chameleons, it has since been determined that SCP-7408-A can refract light to such a fine degree that it can generate visual illusions in its immediate vicinity.

SCP-7408-A does not need to eat or drink, subsisting entirely off of [[[SCP-2332 | exposure to light]]]. Any form of light is sufficient for maintaining its survival, with natural sunlight providing the highest quantity of nutrition.

SCP-7408-A is solely directed by SCP-7408-B&#39;s conscious and subconscious impulses, who has described the process as being analogous to controlling a limb. In the event that SCP-7408-B does not remain within 20m of at least 65% of SCP-7408-A, it has been deemed extremely probable that SCP-7408-B will experience brain death.

SCP-7408-B is Dr. ████████ Kondraki.

**Name:** Dr. ████████ Kondraki[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]See Addendum 7408-3.[[/span]]

**Associated Groups of Interest:** GoI-0267 ([[[are-we-cool-yet-hub | Are We Cool Yet? ]]])

**Biography:** Born on 04/08/1970 in Lee, Massachusetts to Antoni and Łucja Kondraki. Reportedly had a poor relationship with his immediate family, moving out of home immediately after finishing high school.

Excelled academically from an early age, graduating from Columbia University in 1998 with PhDs in both Electrical Engineering and Biological Sciences. Was considered for Foundation employment, though a job offer was never extended due to budget cuts.

Became briefly romantically entangled with PoI-0267-113 (&#34;Hugo Manray&#34;), whom he had met through a hobbyist photography group. Was subsequently introduced to the anart collective Are We Cool Yet? and the wider anomalous world.

By 2001, had gained a degree of renown in the anartist community for his skill in creating anart equipment-- primarily anomalous cameras &amp; film.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]His own art was largely nonanomalous, being mostly landscape and wildlife photography.[[/span]] Was sought for arrest by the Foundation, but never caught.

On 06/17/2005, several months after the birth of his son, Draven Kondraki, he contacted the Foundation through a third party requesting to strike a bargain. Offered the anomalous objects in his possession and detailed information regarding several high-priority figures in AWCY? in exchange for amnesty, protection from AWCY? reprisal, and full-time employment as a Foundation researcher. The Foundation accepted his terms under the condition that he may not create new anomalous objects without the permission of the O5 Council.

I didn&#39;t get much out of my first interrogation. 7408 either doesn&#39;t know anything about itself-- what it is, where it came from, if there are any more anomalies like it --or it&#39;s trying to play dumb. It&#39;s pretty open to dialogue, though... should I try and wear it down? Something to consider.

Next time I&#39;ll see if I can convince it to do that camouflage trick again-- something better than text, ideally.

Turns out SCP-7408 feeds on light, so keeping containment costs low should be easy.

Could that be how its camouflage works? Is it camouflage at all, or can it use light in other ways? Make sure to investigate.

Can SCP-7408 instances reproduce? I haven&#39;t seen any caterpillars or chrysalises since I started this... I&#39;m scanning through the surveillance footage and got nothing so far. They&#39;re not dividing like amoebas or growing out of motes of light or appearing out of thin air...

They&#39;re not doing anything, actually. Whenever I&#39;m not in the room, the footage shows them just flying around aimlessly.

If they&#39;re reproducing, they&#39;re real good at hiding it. Is perception a factor?

**Addendum 7408-2: Cognition Reflection Testing**

Various subjects of differing backgrounds were brought into Containment Chamber 7408 and prompted to ask it questions regarding information that only they would know. In nearly all cases, it was able to provide accurate responses.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Test #:** 03

**Subject:** D-8499

**Notable Events:** Subject was visibly nervous as the test began. Testing was delayed for nearly 20 minutes, as SCP-7408-A was attempting to hide from the subject by amassing in a far corner of the containment chamber&#39;s ceiling. The subject, at Dr. Kondraki&#39;s prompting, was gradually able to coax SCP-7408-A down.

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Test #:** 19

**Subject:** D-3976

**Notable Events:** Subject and SCP-7408-A had an involved discussion regarding dimensional harmonics.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]D-3976 is a former Prometheus Labs researcher.[[/span]] Afterwards, the subject described SCP-7408-A&#39;s conversational abilities as &#34;limited, but unmistakably passionate.&#34;

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Test #:** 20

**Subject:** D-0500

**Notable Events:** Subject was provided a transcribed list of questions previously given to SCP-7408-A in the prior test. SCP-7408-A did not display knowledge of or interest in the subject of dimensional harmonics.

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Test #:** 34

**Subject:** D-0410

**Notable Events:** Subject has a known history of anger management issues, violent outbursts, and a general lack of concern for the well-being of others. Over the course of the test, SCP-7408-A made several graphic and detailed threats on the subject&#39;s life, though at no point did it attempt to act on them.

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Test #:** 48

**Subject:** D-9707 &amp; D-4244

**Notable Events:** Subjects were instructed to prepare their questions in advance and ask them simultaneously. Each time this occurred, SCP-7408-A attempted to answer both questions simultaneously, often mixing its responses together.

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Test #:** 49

**Subject:** D-8099 &amp; D-1585

**Notable Events:** Subjects were instructed to take care not to overlap their questions and to give SCP-7408-A time to respond. SCP-7408-A’s responses were largely accurate, but less so than SCP-7408-A&#39;s answers for single subjects.

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Test #:** 55

**Subject:** D-3266

**Notable Events:** Subject was injected with a delayed-action sedative immediately before the beginning of the test. SCP-7408-A was initially able to answer questions as normal, but gradually lost coherence as time went on.

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Test #:** 72

**Subject:** D-6022

**Notable Events:** Subject was provided a microphone in an adjacent room that was connected to a speaker in Containment Chamber 7408. SCP-7408-A did not answer to or indicate awareness of remote verbal prompts. When the subject was brought into the containment chamber, SCP-7408-A began answering questions as expected.

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Test #:** 74

**Subject:** D-2183 &amp; D-1260

**Notable Events:** Subject A (D-2183) was instructed to ask questions remotely, while Subject B (D-1260) was instructed to enter the containment chamber without speaking. SCP-7408-A displayed awareness of and ability to respond to remote verbal prompts, but could not answer questions accurately.

I’ve figured it out.

Though it&#39;s capable of language and complicated thought, you can’t call SCP-7408 &#34;intelligent.&#34;

It doesn&#39;t display human-level intellect while alone. It’s easy to confuse when exposed to more than one person at once. In our interactions, it’s acted stubbornly curious and contrary-- traits that, I&#39;m forced to admit, I share. In its interactions with others, I&#39;ve seen analogous changes in its personality.

SCP-7408 isn&#39;t a hive mind, it&#39;s a //mirror//. It //reflects// minds. On its own, it&#39;s just... blank. An empty brain, networked across hundreds of butterflies and waiting to be filled out.

Like it does to rays of light, SCP-7408 bends and refracts all thoughts that pass through it. It&#39;s a simplified, abstracted sort of reflection-- information without understanding, identity without personhood. All the pieces are there but it doesn’t have the tools to put them together.

Between its reflective psychology and its lifelike illusions, SCP-7408 is fucking //dangerous//.

Thank //god// I got to it first.

**Addendum 7408-3: Incident 7408-01**

On 08/04/2009, at 2:15 PM, security cameras stationed in and around Containment Chamber 7408 ceased functioning for 12.5 minutes, shortly before Dr. Kondraki entered the chamber.

Something&#39;s been bugging me about 7408. It&#39;s been an itch at the back of my mind since the beginning, before it got me my promotion.

This anomaly revolves around perception, right? Light and illusions and reflections. It multiplies when nobody can see it. You look at 7408 and try to interpret it-- it looks at you and interprets right back.

It&#39;s color. It&#39;s interpretation. It&#39;s //art//. Somebody //made// this.

I don&#39;t think it was recent, either. This is a hunch, but 7408 doesn&#39;t feel like something modern anartists would produce. It feels old. //Very// old.

**Manray:** {{Now, for old time&#39;s sake. Any last words?}}

//[Gunshot. Several overloud impact noises as the recorder falls and skitters across the floor.]//

**Manray:** {{Hm. Well, what do you know?}}

Dr. Kondraki was found unconscious on the floor of Containment Chamber 7408 in a pool of blood from a gunshot wound in his upper right temple. No SCP-7408-A instances could be found within the chamber, presumed stolen by Manray. Dr. Kondraki&#39;s recorder had been smashed and a slip of paper was crumpled in his right hand:

In the hours immediately following the incident, it was discovered that Dr. Kondraki had also fallen prey to a media-altering, antimemetic anomalous phenomenon. From that point onward, Dr. Kondraki&#39;s eyes have been automatically redacted from all visual records of his face. His first name, ████████, is likewise redacted from all visual and audial records.

**Addendum 7408-4: Incident 7408-02**

Dr. Kondraki was rendered comatose by the attempt on his life, his condition stabilizing once the bleeding was staunched by Foundation medics. Initial medical scans determined that the gunshot had damaged his brain to the extent that several of his vital organs should have stopped functioning-- despite this, they were all operating normally. Further scans discovered the existence of a small mass of unknown matter in Dr. Kondraki&#39;s brain, near the point where the bullet entered his skull.

It was later determined that the unknown mass was composed of 2-3 SCP-7408-A instances.

I can&#39;t sleep. Haven&#39;t been able to for a while, not since I got word that Dad died. Things were pretty touch and go for a while there, but I honestly thought things were getting better.

Guess not.

I&#39;m not broken up about it. He was a bastard that made my childhood living hell. I don&#39;t //miss// him, it&#39;s just-- I thought I&#39;d be happier about it, being free of him. But instead I&#39;m...

//[Silence on recording.]//

Drunk. I&#39;m feeling drunk about it. Here&#39;s to you, you self-obsessed piece of shit.

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

//[A single SCP-7408-A instance crawls out from under Dr. Kondraki&#39;s left hand. It begins flying about the room.]//

[[/div]]

I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about butterflies. The idea of them, I mean, not 7408.

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

//[Three additional SCP-7408-A instances fly out from under Dr. Kondraki&#39;s blanket.]//

I found a chrysalis on a hike with Dad when I was... fuck, I dunno, seven or eight? I took a sharp rock and-- carved it open, right there. Its insides slopped out like goo-- &#39;cause that&#39;s what happens to caterpillars, they gotta dissolve their bodies into a soup before they can turn into butterflies.

I freaked out, of course, cried my little head off. Dad sure was pissed. He&#39;d brought me to teach me how to hunt and here I was, sobbing over a dead bug.

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

//[Six SCP-7408-A instances crawl out of Dr. Kondraki&#39;s hospital gown, flying to join the other instances.]//

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]

It fucks me up, thinking about what happens to caterpillars. It&#39;s sort of like dying, isn&#39;t it? Getting your whole body dissolved, even if it gets reconstituted later. I mean, it&#39;s not //really// a death, all its cells are still alive. It&#39;s dying-but-not-dying.

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

//[SCP-7408-A instances begin pouring out of every nook and cranny in the room that is out of the security camera&#39;s line of sight.]//

//[The air becomes choked with SCP-7408-A instances.]//

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]

I&#39;ve never believed in the afterlife, not really. I always knew I&#39;d just... stop, when my time came. I thought it sounded peaceful.

But now... they don&#39;t let me see a lot at the Foundation, not with my clearance. But I&#39;ve seen enough to know that there&#39;s more out there, after this life. Death isn&#39;t an ending, it&#39;s a //changing//. Your body turns into a corpse and your soul or your essence or whatever-the-fuck goes and becomes something else. A changing. Passing on. Dying-but-not-dying.

//[The fluorescents dim as SCP-7408-A begins drawing all light in the room into its collective wings.]//

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]

That&#39;s what really scares me. That&#39;s what&#39;s keeping me up every night. When it&#39;s my turn to go...

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

//[The room is lit only by countless swirling points of emerald light.]//

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]

...what will I become?

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

//[Dr. Kondraki wakes up.]//
