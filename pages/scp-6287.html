**Item #:** SCP-6287

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Mobile Task Force Pi-1 (&#39;City Slickers&#39;) has been dispatched to investigate SCP-6287&#39;s disappearance, and report all findings to Lead Researcher Gus McGinley.

**Description:** SCP-6287 is the small town of Littleton, New Jersey, following an anomalous occurrence on 7 June, 2002. At approximately 0300 EST, SCP-6287, along with all 730 residents, spontaneously vanished without a trace. Thus far, the Foundation has discovered no evidence of any dimensional abnormalities possibly accounting for the city&#39;s disappearance, and the current status of SCP-6287 and its occupants remains unknown.

**Update:** On 10 June, 2002, Foundation Agent Lyle Putt was dispatched to survey the area formerly occupied by SCP-6287. At 1730 EST, Putt reported hearing what he described as a loud crunching sound, and after several seconds of silence, became hysterical. Analysis of structural debris recovered from Agent Putt&#39;s right boot was confirmed to match that of SCP-6287, which had evidently been reduced to an area of roughly ~5 cmÂ². The impact resulted in the deaths of at least 600 of the town&#39;s inhabitants, and efforts to assist survivors proved unsuccessful, with complications arising due to their reduced stature. 

Following this incident, SCP-6287 is currently pending reclassification as Neutralized. Agent Putt faced no disciplinary action, instead receiving six months paid leave, as well as a referral to a Foundation counsellor.
