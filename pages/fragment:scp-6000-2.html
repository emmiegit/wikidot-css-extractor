**SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** Current protocol regarding SCP-6000 is to conceal its existence by any means necessary. As the information arm of Project FUSILLADE, Foundation resources are to be primarily dedicated to disinformation and concealment while a permanent containment or destruction solution is devised. Any unauthorized individuals entering the SCP-6000 Exclusion Zone are to be aggressively disincentivized. Further containment details can be found in Addendum 6000.3.

**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-6000 is a massive dimensional extrusion centered at 2° 9&#39; 47.1816&#39;&#39; S and 55° 7&#39; 35.9328&#39;&#39; W, in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. SCP-6000 represents the largest Class-W transportation gateway, colloquially known as a Way, ever encountered by the Foundation. SCP-6000 currently measures 19km from its northeast to southwest point. The area directly affected by SCP-6000&#39;s presence is significantly larger, and a temporary security perimeter has been established around the area at a diameter of 8km, designated the Exclusion Zone.

SCP-6000 is growing at an unstable rate. Its presence has an adverse effect on plant and animal life in the Exclusion Zone. The degree of this effect (along with the size of the Exclusion Zone itself) increases proportionally with SCP-6000.

SCP-6000-A is a sapient semi-ophidian organism discovered within the Exclusion Zone during initial reconnaissance of SCP-6000 (see Addendum 6000.2). It was found in a comatose state surrounded by human corpses. SCP-6000-A&#39;s connection with SCP-6000 is under investigation (see Addenda).

SCP-6000 connects baseline reality with the extradimensional location known as the Wanderer&#39;s Library. The Wanderer&#39;s Library was first encountered by the Foundation in 1955, but evidence suggests it has played a crucial part in the development of human civilization since at least the beginning of recorded history (See Addendum 6000.1).

SCP-6000 first appeared on December 21st, 2030, the summer solstice. Realtime satellite images of the Amazon rainforest suddenly displayed a significant visual anomaly, and a reconnaissance team was deployed to inspect the area.

**The Wanderer&#39;s Library**, designated Nx-001, is an extradimensional Y-space comprised of a massive library of unclear size &amp; boundaries which contains a potentially infinite amount of books, treatises, essays, and other forms of media and knowledge. Its collection purportedly covers the sum of all knowledge, but with a specific focus on elements of thaumaturgy and magic. The Foundation has been aware of the Library since 1955 when the Group of Interest known as the Serpent&#39;s Hand inadvertently exposed the location to Agents.

The Library is maintained by Librarians, entities that range in size and shape but are typically heavily modified humanoids specialized to the service and protection of Nx-001. Those who break the rules of the Library are subject to being transformed into Librarians to work off their debt. This fate has befallen a number of Foundation personnel.

Nx-001 is closely connected to GoI-014, the Serpent&#39;s Hand. The Hand are known to use the Library as a meeting and staging point for operations due to the relative safety it offers. Numerous attempts have been made by Foundation and GOC forces to penetrate into the Library, but almost all have failed.

The Foundation, along with the GOC and Chaos Insurgency, were originally barred from the Library due to the Library&#39;s opinions on those who attempt to suppress the abnormal, but have in recent years relaxed their stance. Site-19 Director Tilda Moose has had extensive experience with the Wanderer&#39;s Library and the Serpent&#39;s Hand as a former Type-Blue entity, and has given several security briefings on the topic.

**MOOSE:** &#34;Extradimensional&#34; is the technical term, though not very descriptive. The Library isn&#39;t on our world, though it&#39;s connected to it. You reach it through Ways. Ways are a network of… basically magic portals that take you from one place to another. They&#39;re scattered around the world. A Way can be anything you can picture as a door. Or anything like a door. A cave, an archway, the back of a truck. Some of them are just art pieces — I once used a picture of a door to enter the Library, back when I still could.

Oh, yes. I used to be a Librarygoer. That was a long time ago, though. Back when I ran with other groups.

Yeah, it&#39;s... I suppose otherworldly, is the best word for it. Nothing quite compares. The architecture and decorations are... they&#39;re not alive, but they&#39;re mutable, always changing. When I frequented, the place was on an Art Deco kick. You could look up and see the constellations on the false ceiling.

That all ended when I joined the Foundation, though. The Library does not like us, to say the least. Especially not me. No, I would not like to talk about it. Moving on...

Communication from the 3-man reconnaissance team ceased after this transmission. A RES/CON team and a fireteam from MTF Sigma-3 (&#34;Bibliographers&#34;) were immediately deployed to the location. They found the surveillance team&#39;s equipment and supplies, but none of the three members. Tracks leading away from the site indicated that they had gone into what is now the Exclusion Zone.

While searching for the missing reconnaissance team, personnel discovered the corpses of twelve unknown individuals dressed in robes, at the foot of a thaumaturgic ritual circle. In the center of the circle was SCP-6000-A, coiled and in a comatose state. The entity was quickly airlifted into containment at Facility-57.

In the interim, one of the fireteams was outfitted for an expedition into SCP-6000. Due to her extensive experience with Nx-001, Ways, and the Serpent&#39;s Hand, Director Moose was flown in from Facility-57, where she was on an administrative visit, to accompany the fireteam.

**COMMAND:** Copy that.

//[CHICAGO cuts through the treeline, advancing through the thick foliage.]//

**CHICAGO-THREE:** Wait. You guys hear something?

//[CHICAGO freezes. Indistinct noises can be heard faintly.]//

**CHICAGO-TWO:** It&#39;s coming from the anomaly.

**COMMAND:** You&#39;re still a klick and a half out, Chicago.

**CHICAGO-ONE:** Copy. Keep moving.

//[CHICAGO continue to advance through the jungle.]//

**CHICAGO-THREE:** There&#39;s something wrong with the air, Command. It&#39;s all... shimmery, like an oil slick.

**CHICAGO-TWO:** It&#39;s like an oil sheen on the plants. I&#39;ve never seen anything quite like it.

**CHICAGO-FOUR:** Taking sample photos. //[Pause.]// Look at this.

//[A large portion of the tree trunk extending several dozen feet high has been transfigured into a bookshelf. There are no books present.]//

**CHICAGO-THREE:** When did that happen?

**CHICAGO-FOUR:** It&#39;s still happening, look.

//[The trees immediately nearby are undergoing the same process as the bark and wood disintegrate to form natural bookshelves.]//

**CHICAGO-TWO:** This definitely isn&#39;t a normal Way. 

**CHICAGO-ONE:** Eyes up, folks.

**CHICAGO-ONE:** We&#39;re about to break over the ridge, Command.

**COMMAND:** Copy that, Chicago. You are clear.

//[Pause.]//

**CHICAGO-THREE:** Ho-ly shit. Hold on-

//[CHICAGO-ONE adjusts his body camera. A large swath of the forest has completely disappeared, and been replaced with a large &#39;cut&#39; in space leading into an empty wing of Nx-001. No books are on the massive shelves, and no entities are visible inside.]//

**CHICAGO-TWO:** It&#39;s... empty. That&#39;s new.

**CHICAGO-FOUR:** What the hell?

**CHICAGO-ONE:** Weird. Command, permission to investigate?

**COMMAND:** Standby. //[Pause.]// Permission granted, but Two is gonna have to stay outside. Don&#39;t want to risk pissing them off.

**CHICAGO-TWO:** Of course. 

**CHICAGO-THREE:** Roger.

//[CHICAGO-THREE shrugs off her assault rifle and sidearm, laying them on the ground. CHICAGO-TWO draws her handgun. CHICAGO advances into the clearing, their boots clunking.]//

**CHICAGO-ONE:** Huh. 

//[CHICAGO-ONE kicks the dirt on the ground. His boot hits something hard.]//

**CHICAGO-ONE:** It&#39;s hardwood. Just covered by dirt. What the fuck is going on here?

//[CHICAGO approach SCP-6000&#39;s edge, looking inside.]//

**CHICAGO-ONE:** Hello? Anyone there?

//[Silence.]//

**CHICAGO-ONE:** Permission to move in, Command?

**COMMAND:** Permission granted. Be careful.

//[CHICAGO steps through SCP-6000, arriving on the other side. CHICAGO-TWO remains on the Earth side.]//

**CHICAGO-ONE:** Command? You read?

**COMMAND:** Loud and clear. Anything?

**CHICAGO-FOUR:** It&#39;s.... totally empty. I don&#39;t like this.

**CHICAGO-THREE:** This place feels... different, from the Library.

**CHICAGO-ONE:** I thought that was just me.

**CHICAGO-TWO:** No, definitely different. Look at the ceiling. There&#39;s no roof, it&#39;s just dark. The shelves are unvarnished.

**CHICAGO-ONE:** It&#39;s... unfinished. I didn&#39;t realize that could happen.

//[Distantly, a large noise is audible. CHICAGO adopts a defensive position.]//

**CHICAGO-FOUR:** Oh shit.

//[A massive red millipede passes between two shelves ahead, ignoring CHICAGO. Its pincers skitter.]// 

**CHICAGO-FOUR:** Archivist.

**CHICAGO-ONE:** Command, please advise.

**COMMAND:** You are authorized to attempt to peacefully engage. Air support has been scrambled from Facility-57 as backup. 

**CHICAGO-ONE:** Copy. //[To entity.]// Hey! Hello!

//[Entity turns to CHICAGO and screeches, slamming its pincers together. A feminine hiss is heard.]//

**UNIDENTIFIED:** I see your intentions. Begone.

//[Several Class-3 Librarian entities clamber over the tops of nearby shelves. They are humanoid arachnids with elongated bodies, four eyes, and additional limbs. They wear the uniform of the reconnaissance team.]//

**CHICAGO-ONE:** Oh Jesus. Hey, we&#39;ve done nothing wrong, we haven&#39;t broken the rules. What is this?

//[The Librarians begin descending the shelves and advancing. CHICAGO begins to move backward closer to SCP-6000.]//

**CHICAGO-TWO:** Guys....

**COMMAND:** Pull out, now.

**CHICAGO-ONE:** Go!

//[CHICAGO turns and run toward SCP-6000, several dozen meters away. The Librarians drop to the ground and lope along in pursuit, considerably faster but farther away. One catches up to and tackles CHICAGO-FOUR, bringing him to the ground. CHICAGO-TWO draws her handgun from the other side and fires into Nx-001.]//

**CHICAGO-FOUR:** Fuck! FUCK! HELP!

//[CHICAGO-THREE turns and rushes to aid him, punching the Librarian in the jaw. Several Class-2 Librarians, hooded entities several meters high holding lanterns, round the corner. CHICAGO-THREE turns to CHICAGO-ONE.]//

**CHICAGO-THREE:** What the fuck are you waiting for! Run!

//[CHICAGO-ONE turns and runs with Librarians less than a meter behind him, throwing himself through SCP-6000 just as two AH-1Z Vipers from MTF Delta-45 &#34;Rolling Thunder&#34; swoop into the clearing, laying suppressive fire near SCP-6000. CHICAGO-ONE and CHICAGO-TWO are rappelled up and safely recovered.]//

The sudden, unprovoked hostility from Nx-001 and transformation of the reconnaissance team into Librarians, a punishment typically reserved for serious breaks in Nx-001 law, prompted an emergency Council meeting the next day while MTF Delta-45 maintained the security perimeter around SCP-6000. 

Chicago-One (Agent Adam MacMillan) and Chicago-Two (Director Tilda Moose) were evacuated to Facility-57, the ad-hoc organizational facility for the containment of SCP-6000.

Due to its relatively remote location, the threat posed was not as significant as it could have been; nevertheless, the possible threat of a permanent large Class-W Way on Earth was significant. On December 23rd, SCPOVERCOM, then known as Overwatch Command, authorized the first series of containment and mitigation protocols for the //in situ// containment of SCP-6000. These were packaged together as Project FUSILLADE. 

* The designation of Facility-57 as official containment facility of SCP-6000.
* The construction of a fence around the Exclusion Zone to deter wildlife and travelers.
* The requisition of resources for the long-term study of SCP-6000.
* The arrest of known cells of GoI-14, the Serpent&#39;s Hand.
* The authorization of members of MTF Sigma-3 to aggressively seek out means of combating Nx-001.

Shortly after this, SCP-6000-A awoke from its comatose state during preliminary examination by medical personnel at Facility-57. It immediately attacked, but was quickly disabled by security guards.

While in containment, SCP-6000-A repeatedly referenced the Wanderer&#39;s Library and the Serpent&#39;s Hand. Due to her status as the senior personnel with the most experience regarding Nx-001, Director Moose was authorized to perform investigative interviews accompanied by armed guards to attempt to gain information on the subject.

**MOOSE:** Wow, I haven&#39;t been called that in a minute. You&#39;re Hand, then?

**SCP-6000-A:** No. Maybe. I cannot remember.

**MOOSE:** I see. What do you remember? 

**SCP-6000-A:** Floating in a void. Dreaming. Sitting under an apple tree. Hearing something whisper stories into my ear. Then waking up, here, on a cold metal table surrounded by men with knives.

**MOOSE:** Sorry about that. So you don&#39;t remember how you found yourself  like... this?

**SCP-6000-A:** No. Is there something wrong with my appearance?

**MOOSE:** Oh. You&#39;ll, ah, take a look for yourself. 

//[MOOSE points at a mirror on the wall. SCP-6000-A touches its face gingerly, running its fingers up and down the scales.]//

**SCP-6000-A:** Oh.

**MOOSE:** So you didn&#39;t know. Okay.

**SCP-6000-A:** No. This is... new. The voice did say that it would mold me in its image, but...

**MOOSE:** What voice?

**SCP-6000-A:** I don&#39;t know how long I was dreaming. But it was with me the whole time. Dangling from the branches of the tree, murmuring tales and stories and myths. Stories about the Jailors, the Bookburners, the Library itself. But you wouldn&#39;t know about that.

**MOOSE:** I do, as it happens. I&#39;ve been in the Library many times. Used to, anyway.

**SCP-6000-A:** Mmm. I remember being told that some Jailors could enter... why, beyond me.

**MOOSE:** Various reasons. Information. Travel. But there are quite a few restrictions. They&#39;re not allowed to help the rest of the Foundation contain anything.

**SCP-6000-A:** Is that not what you are doing to me?

**MOOSE:** The situation has changed, to put it lightly.

**SCP-6000-A:** Ah. The Way, yes?

**MOOSE:** So you do know something about all this. Tell me.

**SCP-6000-A:** And why would I do that?

**MOOSE:** Because you&#39;ve been cooperative enough. Because I went in and now six of my people have been torn apart by the Librarians. Because you still have some humanity left over. Take your pick.

**SCP-6000-A:** Hm. A trade, a story for a story. My mind is bursting with stories, but the only way to know a story is to tell it. 

**MOOSE:** What kind of story?

**SCP-6000-A:** Why don&#39;t you tell me the story of your last time in the Library?

**MOOSE:** I- Why do you care about that?

**SCP-6000-A:** Because I remember the feeling of the Library, but I can&#39;t remember anything about it. Maybe you will awaken something.

//[Control instructs MOOSE to cooperate.]//

**MOOSE:** //[Sighing]// It was in… must have been fifteen years ago, by now. I was on the rocks with the Hand - we didn&#39;t really agree on how we should go about improving the world that we live in. There&#39;s a section of the Library, the Five Archives. I don&#39;t know if you remember.

**SCP-6000-A:** I do. Great stone vaults filled with knowledge considered forbidden, even by the Library&#39;s standards. Where new Librarians are made. Impossible to get to.

**MOOSE:** Yeah, that&#39;s what they all said. Nothing&#39;s impossible if you know the magic well enough. I spent months preparing and then set the rituals alight. Only took a few minutes and then I was inside, the staff none the wiser.

**SCP-6000-A:** I... have never heard this story. What did you do?

**MOOSE:** I took some things. Books. Maps of Ways. Lists. Things that, if given to the Foundation, would give them a tactical edge in dealing with the Library. Then I left the way I came.

**SCP-6000-A:** You betrayed the Library.

**MOOSE:** Yeah. No other way to put it. 

**SCP-6000-A:** Describe the place to me.

**MOOSE:** The Library? I&#39;m hoping you already know, on some level. Trying to describe it to anyone who hasn&#39;t seen it is like trying to explain the difference between two colors to a blind man. It&#39;s utterly alien, foreign, beyond the cusp of understanding. It&#39;s wondrous and magic and it&#39;s bitter and spiteful. Center of the universe.

**SCP-6000-A:** Maybe it is. 

**MOOSE:** I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. Place is infinite.

**SCP-6000-A:** No. Not infinite. Merely impossibly large.

**MOOSE:** What&#39;s the difference?

**SCP-6000-A:** It&#39;s eternally expanding as new stories are written and new knowledge is found. It expands and consumes dead stories, stories that have ended, into itself. To turn them into shelves for other stories so that something new might exist in their place.

**MOOSE:** Huh.

**SCP-6000-A:** My story is about that, a bit. Once upon a time, there was a little girl who woke up and found she could spin fire. She lit toys, candles, papers on fire, until men with guns kicked down the door to her tenement and tried to take her away. That was when she learned she could also light people on fire, and found that it was much less fun. Then she ran and ran until she met people, street witches and miraclemakers, who were just like her. They opened a door to a world where she could be herself without fear of reprisal.

**MOOSE:** The Library.

**SCP-6000-A:** Yes. She walked among the shelves and saw the Docents and read every single story she wanted. But she came across a problem. Every story ended. Some were short, some were long, but they all came to an end sooner or later.

**MOOSE:** How is that a problem?

**SCP-6000-A:** It wasn&#39;t, not really. But she couldn&#39;t stop thinking about the end of the stories and one question, always ringing out -- what happened after? Did the characters struggle against their end, or was it a calm affair?

**MOOSE:** I can relate. But what does this have to do with us?

**SCP-6000-A:** I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m still sorting through the stories - I simply pick that which seems relevant. But I&#39;d look for the Serpent&#39;s Hand. They helped the girl. Maybe they can help you.

Upon SCP-6000-A&#39;s suggestion and in line with Project FUSILLADE, on December 27th, 2030, SCPOVERCOM approved Operation REDLOCK for MTFs worldwide to make simultaneous raids on the known headquarters of major Serpent&#39;s Hand cells. On December 28th, Operation REDLOCK was successfully executed.

All fifty-seven safehouses raided had been completely cleared out and were free of GoI-014 members or materials. In thirty of them, Class-W gateways were and are still active, leading into the same section of Nx-001 as SCP-6000. By all appearances, the Serpent&#39;s Hand had completely abandoned the planet, leaving active Ways peppered across the globe.

At this point, SCP-6000 had grown to 1km across, and the Exclusion Zone had expanded to 3km. Director Tilda Moose was asked to prepare a statement detailing her thoughts on the situation for the O5 Council.

I don&#39;t know what precipitated this. But if the Library&#39;s turned against humanity, the situation is going to be dire. It&#39;s a completely alien entity to us, we can&#39;t even begin to understand what it is or why it does the things it does. Hell, we don&#39;t even know if there&#39;s a rhyme or reason to anything. 

Most Foundation personnel only know of the Library in the abstract, but I and a handful of others have actually stepped foot in the shelves. We can tell you that it is at once humanity&#39;s greatest boon and its greatest threat. Imagine how much of history has been influenced by people getting into the Library and bringing back knowledge they would otherwise never have had. Now imagine how fucked we&#39;ll be if the source of all knowledge in the universe turns on us.

I don&#39;t see this story having a happy ending.

**VASQUEZ:** No, the Amazon is too high-profile for that sort of thing. Have we considered the Atreus Array?

**MOOSE:** Initial experiments out of the Exclusion Zone using SRAs on SCP-6000 seem to have had no effect.

**VASQUEZ:** Dammit. What the fuck is this thing?

**MOOSE:** It&#39;s a Way. Ways aren&#39;t matter, they&#39;re not quite energy, we barely understand anything about them.

**MACMILLAN:** Ways dissipate a few minutes after formation. It&#39;s been weeks and SCP-6000 has only gotten larger.

**KURTZ:** None of the new Ways have dissipated either. Something&#39;s obviously changed.

**MOOSE:** Yes, but //what?// We have no idea and no leads.

**MOOSE:** Well, not //no// leads.

**KURTZ:** Oh right, the snake-thing you pulled out. What the hell is that thing&#39;s story?

**MOOSE:** I don&#39;t know. It doesn&#39;t remember anything before we picked it up. It&#39;s definitely more connected to the Library than its letting on. Or that it remembers.

**KURTZ:** Well, keep working on it. In the meantime: we&#39;ve got new reports out of the Exclusion Zone detailing what SCP-6000 is doing to the flora and fauna.

**VASQUEZ:** It&#39;s... I don&#39;t know how to phrase this, so it&#39;s &#39;Library-ifying&#39; everything around it.

**MACMILLAN:** When I was in there, I saw the trees turning into shelves. Writing appearing on the leaves. That sort of thing, I bet.

**VASQUEZ:** Essentially. The animals are also being distorted and changed - we&#39;ve spotted jaguars with extra limbs, birds two feet tall and with writing all over their wings, et cetera. It&#39;s warping the landscape into part of the Library.

**KURTZ:** And the larger SCP-6000 gets, the larger the Exclusion Zone gets.

**MACMILLAN:** Hm. That&#39;s bad news.

**KURTZ:** To say the least. That said, I have some ideas that are worth trying. Let&#39;s hope one of them works.

**MOOSE:** Hi again. 

**SCP-6000-A:** Jailor.

**MOOSE:** Why do you keep calling me that? You&#39;re not Hand, you can&#39;t even remember the Library.

**SCP-6000-A:** Oh, but I can. I can remember some things now. Not everything, but hopefully it will come.

**MOOSE:** Really? What is it?

**SCP-6000-A:** I remember being a young woman in the Dinodon&#39;s Hand. Searching for the worship of knowledge in the Library and out.

**MOOSE:** Worship? Awfully religious for the Hand, I&#39;d damn well know. I ran with them for years.

**SCP-6000-A:** Really? And now you&#39;re a Foundation director. What changed?

**MOOSE:** I don&#39;t want to talk about it, but suffice to say that I realized maybe not all knowledge is meant to be shared. Anyway. You were saying?

**SCP-6000-A:** Yes... the Hand started out as a cult, thousands of years ago. The Hand of the Serpent, a warrior cult dedicated to the worship of the Serpent that created the Library.

**MOOSE:** The Serpent?

**SCP-6000-A:** Knowledge incarnate. The spirit of learning. The Naga. Jormungandr. The Snake in the Tree. Every mythical snake iconography is said to stem from the primal Serpent. 

**MOOSE:** But no one knows if it&#39;s actually real. 

**SCP-6000-A:** Shh. Let me finish my story, Jailor. The Hand were powerful, long-lived monks, but eventually died out, leaving their teachings behind. Theses, passages, essays on why the spread of knowledge was the greatest honor possible and should be done at all possible cost. Many years later, people from this world discovered these writings and christened themselves the New Serpent&#39;s Hand, the one you and I know today. They shed the trappings of ritual, but the worship of knowledge as an ideal remains.

**MOOSE:** Wow. I had no idea about the origins. They never told me.

**SCP-6000-A:** Neither did I, when I joined. This is a new story, whispered to me by the Serpent in my dreams.

**MOOSE:** Wait, what?

**SCP-6000-A:** Draw the lines and connect the dots, Jailor. The Serpent is real, she is the spirit of the Library. And, in a ritual circle over an intersection of ley lines in the Amazon rainforest, I spoke to her.

**MOOSE:** And you heard stories.

**SCP-6000-A:** And I heard stories. Of her singing the Library into reality at the beginning of creation, of her molding its halls and then retiring to slumber under its foundations in exhaustion. Of patrons wandering down and speaking to her, even now.

**MOOSE:** Wow.

**SCP-6000-A:** And of stories utterly unrelated to her. 

**MOOSE:** Do any of these stories help me? Heroes of old figuring out to stop the Library when it goes insane and out of control, bent on destruction? The Library&#39;s not supposed to kill or invade, it&#39;s beyond all that. It&#39;s neutral to a fault. I just don&#39;t understand why this is happening.

**SCP-6000-A:** No. No stories like that, Jailor. I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s not how this story ends.

**MOOSE:** Endings are mutable.

**SCP-6000-A:**  Oh, no. That&#39;s not true. Endings are set in stone. But endings don&#39;t matter anyway.

**MOOSE:** How&#39;s that?

**SCP-6000-A:** To any observer, your story ended when you betrayed the Library and came to the Foundation. But it didn&#39;t. You didn&#39;t stop existing. You just transitioned to a new narrative, one where you were the Director of Site-19.

**MOOSE:** That&#39;s not a narrative, it&#39;s my goddamn life.

**SCP-6000-A:** I never finished my story, did I? The little girl read and read and read until one day she realized she had already solved her problem. Of course they all ended.... but she moved on to the next story. There were always //more stories.// No point in lamenting what was inevitable when she could move on.

**MOOSE:** I only wish it ran like that in real life.

**SCP-6000-A:** Yes. All the stories I see with the Foundation staring down the end of the world... they have the Bookburners by their side. I suppose there&#39;s something to say there. Rivals, allying themselves against a threat greater than either could imagine. Smoking ash. A fusillade of fire against a wall of trees.

**MOOSE:** Wait, a fusillade? How did you-

**SCP-6000-A:** Go. Now.

Diplomatic Agents were deployed to the GOC&#39;s operating headquarters in Germany for a prearranged meeting with material regarding the current status of SCP-6000 and associated subjects. Upon deliberation, GOC officials inked a statement indicating interest in expanding Project FUSILLADE to a joint venture. 

Within the following days, GOC PHYSICS, PSYCHE, and PTOLEMY division personnel were transported to Facility-57 to aid in research and containment of SCP-6000, which had grown to 2km across. Due to the unprecedented failure of Fireteam CHICAGO, both the O5 Council and GOC Command authorized a mission for GOC Strike Team 9842 &#34;Probable Cause&#34; to perform a rapid surgical strike to attempt to gain access to the Wanderer&#39;s Library and ascertain the situation from the inside.

Where did the space come from?

**VOICE:** From stories, of course. The Library takes finished stories into its shelves and takes finished worlds into itself. Often one in the same.

Following Operation HARBOR, several radio signals began broadcasting from SCP-6000 and all Ways found during Operation REDLOCK at various frequencies. The message contained therein was simply the same hissing, feminine voice repeating the exact coordinates of SCP-6000&#39;s epicenter and the phrase &#34;The Garden is the Serpent&#39;s place&#34;.

Containment efforts simply contributed to individuals&#39; belief of a conspiracy and eventually resulted in several individuals attempting to reach the Exclusion Zone on foot over the following weeks. While individuals were amnesticized, the larger movement surrounding SCP-6000 continued and is continuing to grow. 

The knowledge of SCP-6000&#39;s presence to the global community seemed to rapidly accelerate its growth. In the following hours, it expanded to nearly 6km across, with no signs of stopping. GOC tactical nuclear solutions are being considered.

In addition, on Jan 21st, Agent MacMillan failed to appear to several FUSILLADE briefings and meetings.

Sorry, Tilly. I used to spend weeks in the Library&#39;s shelves, perusing everything I could come across. It was otherworldly, in the most literal sense of the word. I&#39;m sure you understand the feeling. The difference is that you //couldn&#39;t// go in, you made the choice between the Library and Foundation - when I first entered, it was just a mission. I experienced something amazing, something well beyond what I thought was ever possible. And I thought it was a damn shame that we looked at something so magnificent and only worried about how it might hurt us.

I can see now that&#39;s not the case. The Librarians are only hurting the people that try to stop the expansion. I have no intention of doing that. //This// is the end of the story, not the one where we somehow come up with a silver bullet to fix everything. The only thing I can do is change how I feel about it.

I just want to sit in the shelves and see the false-stars again.

**SCP-6000-A:** You already know, Moose. Denial fixes nothing. I learned it as a little girl, and you learn it now. You don&#39;t get to pick your ending. You only get to choose how you take it.

**MOOSE:** So the girl was you, then.

**SCP-6000-A:** Yes. Even I didn&#39;t realize until now. The memories have come back. I came to that ritual wanting to know how my story ended, and I learned how this world&#39;s story ended. Luckily for me, they were one and the same.

**MOOSE:** Stories are bullshit.

**SCP-6000-A:** Stories are all there is. This one ends with two people sitting in a room, talking. And then they vanish into thin air.

**MOOSE:** Sobering.

**SCP-6000-A:** In a sense, you should be flattered.

**MOOSE:** Why in the world would I be flattered?

**SCP-6000-A:** You left the Library on your terms. And you won&#39;t admit it to anyone, but I see it written on your face: you want to see it again.

**MOOSE:** Like hell I do. It&#39;s wondrous but everyone talks about it like paradise. It screwed me long before I screwed it. 

**SCP-6000-A:** Bitterness gets you nowhere.

**MOOSE:** That&#39;s true. I have work to do. Rot, then.

With the unprecedented failure of the Veil protocol and the ensuing response by Nx-001, the entire Amazon basin has been quarantined and placed in Foundation/GOC jurisdiction under Project FUSILLADE. SCP-6000 has now expanded to 13km in length, and its rate of growth has increased. 

At the moment, plans are being drafted for a BM-Class Broken Masquerade Scenario.
