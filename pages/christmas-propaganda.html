&gt; -----
&gt; &#39;Twas the night before Christmas, When all through the Site,
&gt; Not a single man stirred, Not during that night.
&gt; The chambers were locked and sealed with great care,
&gt; In hopes that their contents would stay just right there.
&gt; 
&gt; The crews sat at home and sung with great joy,
&gt; Content with their work, though a little annoyed.
&gt; And director at desk, and I with the T,
&gt; Had just settled our brains into a dreamworld&#39;s sea.
&gt; 
&gt; When throughout the whole site there arose a great clatter,
&gt; And in my sleepy daze, I ran to see what was the matter.
&gt; Away to the muster point I flew in a dash,
&gt; Away from the sirens, I ran like the Flash.
&gt; 
&gt; The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
&gt; Did nothing to illuminate the terror below.
&gt; As I ran and I ran from impending disaster,
&gt; I could do nought but think of moving much faster.
&gt; 
&gt; But try as I might, I only made it so far,
&gt; Before falling concrete gave me a lethal scar.
&gt; Dying beneath stone, St Nick beyond my sight,
&gt; I wondered what had unleashed this terrible blight.
&gt; 
&gt; Little did I know, there were those who went home,
&gt; When they were needed to stay here, in this zone.
&gt; Without them to stop the escaping disaster,
&gt; It easily broke free, its own sole master.
&gt; 
&gt; As my soul left me, bleeding and hollow,
&gt; I knew only fragments of what was to follow.
&gt; Unkillables, warlords, concepts most vague,
&gt; Upon the earth would wander these plagues.
&gt; 
&gt; Destruction, terror, anarchy and pain,
&gt; Suffering, loneliness, no hope to gain.
&gt; One by one, all across the globe,
&gt; Many unspeakable horrors took hold.
&gt; 
&gt; &#39;Twas the night before Christmas, When all &#39;cross the world,
&gt; Every single man stirred, watching an end unfurl.
&gt; There were no Christmas miracles to save them that night;
&gt; The only miracle? It never reached my sight.
&gt;&gt; + CONTAINMENT DOESN&#39;T STOP ON CHRISTMAS DAY
&gt;&gt; +++ {{Never abandon your assigned shifts. The world depends on it.}}
