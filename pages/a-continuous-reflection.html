There in his shade, it was chilly.
Roles are a challenge for both fathers and sons.
He disagreed with your sensitivity.
You always had the impression that he was a bully because of how frigid he was.

You spent years losing yourself in distractions
unable to fulfill your obligations
Prior to killing someone so beloved, 
he was unaware that he was no angel.

Escape for your life, fast.
Faster than the speed of light
Free, liberated from all connections
Run from all those falsehoods, fast.

But now, his greed has caged him.
All of his heinous and terrible acts
You recovered and cleaned up.
It&#39;s time to recognize that the universe exists.

Taking cabs and catching trains
Maintaining a chaotic life
Although it may appear alone and wild, 
It could appear lonesome and wild, 
yet it gives you the spirit to be genuine.

Escape for your life, fast.
Faster than the speed of light
Free, liberated from all connections
Run from all those falsehoods, fast.

Perhaps you&#39;ll get married someday.
In a small town, run into someone lovely.
You will have a family history of your own.

Teaching your children about happiness and love
How much compassion can truly complete us
Repair your spirit and your heart.
be one&#39;s own hero at any time.
