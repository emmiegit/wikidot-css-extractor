thank you.


what&#39;s that? you&#39;d like to see my pets? they&#39;re in the ball pit right now, but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll see them soon. you know how clowns can be. my mime is rather shy, but my rednose clown loves guests.

Davy Bones 2: Electric Boogaloo!
My third article and first Jamcon 2021 entry, based on the theme &#39;marine&#39;. I had thought of the general idea the night before and when I saw the theme reveal I was like O.M.G IT&#39;S ALL I&#39;VE EVER WANTED
I&#39;m pretty proud of it because 1. jamcon 2. it&#39;s an article I feel is genuinely well written, and got some good reception. 
Overall, I&#39;m glad people like bone kingdom. ALL HAIL BONE KINGDOM

 People love 5851. They think it&#39;s very cool, title //and// content aside. People really love 5851 because it makes them physically cringe and scrunch their face up into a tiny paper ball. You&#39;ll like it if you unironically love or loathe X reader fanfiction. Also, the fanart of the anime boy is cute soooo instant like?

5264 was my first article I ever did :0]! It was a jamcon article for the theme &#39;explosion&#39;. 
If you like brussel sprouts or hate brussel sprouts, or want to argue with me that it&#39;s &#39;brussels sprouts&#39;, this is for you. It&#39;s a very simple article so I wouldn&#39;t bother with it but I do want to edit it in the future. Chef Lorance is an attempt at comedy, too. Overall it&#39;s good from a &#39;newbie who wrote this in a day&#39; standpoint :0]

babies first tale, aaaaah..
While I was an offsite fan I did what many others do: shoehorn all my favourite series I scips into my universe with my ocs and suddenly omg they&#39;re best friends &lt;3 
I developed the Theatre Troupe idea with my buddies, and we talked about it a lot. It was really fun. I really owe it to them because we&#39;d blabber about these collab ideas all the time and since none of us were wiki members it was never posted so I did that because I think it deserves to be somewhere ^_^&#39;
So yeah, Theatre Troupe is yet another group of ~wacky theatre gays living in the Renaissance~ featuring scp-035 &#39;n&#39; 049. It&#39;s okay for a first tale, and pretty funny too. And Penguin&#39;s tale based off of it is AWESOME!
You can find my animatic based off the characters [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNPD1tySI2k&amp;lc=Ugyj8AhSddn7qhq2v4R4AaABAg here.] Yes I procrastinated on it for half a year

**[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/corruption-within-the-clown-industry &lt;Corruption Within The Clown Industry: A Controversial Opinion by Bambousio Starswinger&gt;]**
This is the first Bambousio tale I wrote for Jamcon2021 theme 2: &#39;Corruption&#39;. It&#39;s a very funny idea and it&#39;s my most popular thing/tale (for now) and I think it still holds up! I&#39;m very proud of it and im really really happy it sparked something wonderful that everyone can add onto! I love Starswinger Bigtop. It&#39;s so fun to write for &lt;3 :•] So if you enjoy clowns this is a good place to start reading!

Jamcon21 day 3 tale, a continuation of the new bambousio thing :D I thought &#39;i wanna make another tale with a long ass title&#39; and the theme was &#39;What could possibly go wrong?&#39; so i was like YESSSSSS! more clown lore! and the introduction of Time Clowns was fucking hilarious. theres so much good quotes in this one.

**[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-calm-evening-at-the-clown-park &lt;A Calm Evening at the Clown Park, Where We Make Friends.&gt;]** 
Slice of life tale which is sorta underrated but also very slow. Introduces some new characters, and is basically a transition between the first two tales and anything else you wanna read if you wanna read bambousio things in chronological order. It introduces some new characters, and sets up stuff for SCP-4730 as well. I hope it sticks!

alexa play my ordinary life by the living tombstone slowed please, i need to write about my clown father with a god complex

This is the introduction of a new character (because i just cant stop at a bajillion characters, i need to add MORE) and he&#39;s so cool! I love Levealuto&#39;s voice in this tale. It&#39;s creepy because he has a following who actually listen to him, when you can tell just by this one thing he&#39;s kinda weird! but until I develop more, i hope you like this whole producshizzle. P.S check the crosslink! Who do you think Cosmo is now?

This guy was my first GOI format and WWS format because holy cow this goi fits my writing style so much. It&#39;s very well-written I think it&#39;s one of my best things and even the audience love him! Davy Bones will NOT harm you so there&#39;s nooo worries ;)
Personally I really love the idea and it showed how my brain works through concepts too. I draw a random picture, THEN build an idea off of it. I wish it worked the other way round, but what can you do.

But yeah! I think the format is good for what it is and has an adorable animal and story. Plus, the edited image looks really dope. You&#39;ll like Nuala if you like fairies!

oh here come my lovely clowns. heres my rednose. he&#39;s a purebred rednose but it seems he does have some similarities to the rodeo clown, isn&#39;t that sweet? i heard rednose clowns and rodeo clowns come from the same family, but i specialise more in porcelain clowns so i&#39;m not the one to ask.

&gt; You notice the tent has been fastened shut.

isn&#39;t he just a darling? you should discuss the behaviour of scary clowns with me. I don&#39;t agree with them being banned in certain countries. as i always say, it&#39;s the owner, not the breed. the scary clowns i raise in my other tent are as docile as can be, not to mention their beautiful markings! but that&#39;s a story for another time. please, come see my favourite clowns!
