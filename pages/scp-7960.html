**Special  Containment Procedures:** One Foundation personnel will remain bonded to SCP-7960. Once bonded, this personnel is not permitted off-site. Their primary duties as Foundation staff will not be affected by this arrangement.

**Description:** SCP-7960 is a koala (//Phascolarctos cinereus//) that demonstrates average human intelligence. While SCP-7960 is biologically indistinguishable from an ordinary koala, the entity is capable of vocalization and comprehension of the English language. SCP-7960 is remarkably durable, as all attempts to harm the entity do not result in any observable damage.

SCP-7960 bonds itself to a single individual, clinging to their body. While SCP-7960 can be physically removed from the individual’s body, the entity will reappear on the host&#39;s body, necessitating the outlined containment procedures. 

Once bonded, SCP-7960 will bombard the host with deprecating remarks. It has stated that its grand objective is to “improve” the host through negative reinforcement. The Foundation has observed that SCP-7960 is largely ineffective.

SCP-7960 will remain bonded to a host until their death, upon which a successive host can be named. If no host is named, SCP-7960 will bond itself to the nearest individual.

**Addendum.7960.1:** History

SCP-7960 came into the Foundation’s possession after the discovery of a mail-order advertisement in a June, 1957 issue of RIFLEKID: FUN WITH GUNS, an American comic book released by now-defunct publisher Odyssey. A transcript of the ad has been replicated below.

[[div style=&#34;display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px&#34;]]

THAT’S NOT A MONKEY ON YOUR BACK, KIDDO, THAT’S

 **SELF-IMPROVEMENT KOALA**

DID YOU KNOW YOU’RE THE PROBLEM? PREPARE TO BE REMINDED. 

ONCE HE’S ACTIVATED, NO MORE LITTLE BOY. IT’S TIME FOR A LITTLE MAN!

THERE’S ONLY ONE SELF-IMPROVEMENT KOALA. HE IS FOREVER.

$2000!

[[/div]]

The mailing address listed alongside the advertisement was made out to the offices of GoI-323, &#34;Better-Youth&#34;, a known distributor of occult goods. SCP-7960 was purchased by the Foundation, and immediately bonded with Area-179 Sanitation head Paul Duffy, who was closest to the entity when it was being removed from the wooden crate it was shipped in. Duffy served as the containment specialist for SCP-7960 up until his death in 2022. Ian Wu, an intern who served under Duffy, had willingly volunteered to become SCP-7960’s next host. Wu was fully briefed on the specifics of SCP-7960&#39;s containment prior to acceptance.

Selected logs of Wu’s interactions with SCP-7960 have been included below.

**Addendum.7960.2:** Logs

**Researcher Wu:** The first variable that needs to be obsessed is underlying chance.

**SCP-7960:** Assessed.

**Researcher Wu:** Which— which states that— underlying chance refers to grander metaphysical implications surrounding an anomalous— an anomalous event.

//Wu is silent for several seconds. He closes his eyes, and exhales before continuing.//

Following this, Dr. Wu climbed to the top of Area-179’s helipad and threw himself from the roof, a fall of 75 feet. He was given immediate medical attention, resulting in the treatment of over three dozen broken bones and severe head trauma. Wu sustained a stable, neurologically intact condition, but was placed on medical leave until further notice. 

The following log occurred shortly after Wu&#39;s condition was stabilized.
