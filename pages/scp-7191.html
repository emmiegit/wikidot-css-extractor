**Item #:** SCP-7191

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Personnel must carry out activities to misinform the population of Yekaterinburg about the activity of the SCP-7191. It must follow the legend about a terrorist group, intending to sow panic among the population for their own purposes, in order to divert attention from SCP-7191.

If it is suspected that the SCP-7191 activity has begun or has occurred, Mobile Task Force Sigma-7 &#34;Demon Executioners&#34; is to be dispatched to capture SCP-7191.

**Description:** SCP-7191 is a male humanoid of unknown race and origin with completely red eyes. Often wears blue shirt and dark-blue jeans. Activity shows up in Yekaterinburg, Russia. City cameras were unable to capture a full face, except its red eyes, due SCP-7191 abilities. 

The nature of SCP-7191 is still a mistery, however, it has memetic abilities, teleportation and a slight effect on technology. Height is approximately 160-170 cm, weight 70-80 kg, based on CCTV footage. Everyone who witnessed SCP-7191 activity or were near its area were affected by its memetic abilities and forgot how it looked, and where it went after finishing his deed. Then SCP-7191, presumably, teleports, disappearing from the field of view of cameras, making it difficult to track him.

SCP-7191 activity is hard to predict, since the interval between murders is always different and can either be 1 day or 2 months. SCP-7191 kills regardless of age, race, gender and nationality, making it difficult to figure out its motivation. Each kill is preceded by an event lasting from 2 to 7 days:

* SCP-7191 stalking his victim, using its abilities
* victim feels hatred, contempt, anger and evil directed at him, those are around also feel it
* victim wants to return home as soon as possible
* victim experiences an unexplainable fear
* SCP-7191 breaks into victim&#39;s house at night

**Discovery**: Foundation agents at the local police department discovered strange details in the case of a murdered woman on January 20, 2023. It is noteworthy that this was the 4th case with a similar method of murder and the absence of witnesses. All the victims were decapitated and their bodies mutilated with varying degrees of brutality[[footnote]] See Addendum 7191-01 [[/footnote]]. Severed heads were missing from the crime scenes[[footnote]] See Addendum 7191-03 [[/footnote]]. The first such murder took place on January 3, 2023. The victim was a 45-year-old man.

Agents viewed camera footages from the crime scenes and found SCP-7191 leaving them. After a while, he disappeared from the field of view of the cameras and was nowhere to find. The police were given amnestics. Сrime scene records forged, next murders must also be forged, the disinformation activities were carried out.

Agent ████████ interviewed friends and families of victims[[footnote]] See Addendum 7191-02 [[/footnote]], after which, he reported to Foundation about the situation.

**Addendum 7191-01:** 

List of the murders at the moment of January 25, 2023:

||~ Date of murder ||~ Victim ||~ Description of murder ||
|| January 3, 2023 || Anton Bondarev, 45 years old (first victim) || The head, based on the analysis of the corpse, is torn off with bare hands and missing from the crime scene. Guts were torn out and the body was hung on them on the ceiling. ||
|| January 7, 2023 || Kirill Zhukov, 15 years old (second victim) || [REDACTED] ||
|| January 15, 2023 || Polina Kobyakova, 17 years old (third victim) || All the bones are broken, the stomach is torn, the spine sticks out of it. Heart, lungs and intestines were scattered across the room. ||
|| January 20, 2023 || Kristina Zolotova, 23 years old (fourth victim) || The body was torn in two vertically and hung around the room like a garland. ||

An attempt to trace the SCP-7191 by its fingerprints did not bring results, since there is no citizen with similar fingerprints in the Yekaterinburg or any other database.

[BEGIN LOG]

**Agent:** Hello, Anastasia. My name is ████████ and I wanted to ask you some questions about... Um... About your best friend...

**Anastasia:** ...

**Agent:** I&#39;m sorry to remind you... I know, it&#39;s hard. Do you know anyone who would intend to harm... Or even kill Kirill? We need to know everything that can help us to arrest the murderer.

**Anastasia:** He had conflicts with guys at the school... But they wouldn&#39;t do this to him.

**Agent:** How did they react to the news of his death?

**Anastasia:** Shocked... I... (pause)

**Agent:** Anything else you remember? Maybe... Um... You felt something or something happened before his death... Like...

**Anastasia:** Someone was watching us...?

**Agent:** Hm... More details, please...

**Anastasia:** The day before... Before... We were walking in the ███ park... And just having fun... And then I felt...

**Agent:** That someone watched you both?

**Anastasia:** Uh... Yes... But not only that... I felt... Hatred... (pause) Anger... Something evil... I... I... I felt it was directed not at me...

**Agent:** But at Kirill?

**Anastasia:** Yeah, I think... Then he started looking around... As if he was trying to find someone who watched us... He asked me: &#34;Do you see anyone... creepy?&#34;... I said no... But... But...

**Agent:** What&#39;s wrong, Anastasia? You don&#39;t feel well?

**Anastasia:** No... No... I... I remember... That I saw... Some shadow-like figure behind one of the trees behind us... With red eyes... Completely red eyes... For a moment... I know! It sounds absurd! But... But... I know what I saw!

//Anastasia starts crying//

**Agent:** Don&#39;t worry, Anastasia. I believe you. Really.

**Anastasia:** A-After a while, he wanted to go home... He walked me to mine... And then run... I... I didn&#39;t see him running like this in his whole life... That day... In the evening... He called me...

**Agent:** What were you talking about?

**Anastasia:** &#34;I&#39;m scared...&#34;

**Agent:** Excuse me?

**Anastasia:** When I picked up the phone... He said: &#34;Anya... I&#39;m... I&#39;m scared...&#34;

**Agent:** Did he say why? What made him scared?

**Anastasia:** No.. He didn&#39;t... He just kept saying this for a moment... I asked him if he&#39;s okay. Kirill said &#34;No&#34; and hung up the call...
