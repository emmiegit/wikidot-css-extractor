**Item #:** SCP-5033

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5033 is to be contained within a large flame-resistant animal containment cell at the Biological Containment Wing of Site-432. The cell is to be outfitted with multiple stress-reducing amenities, including but not limited to the following:
* A stereo system playing slow, classical music
* An automatic feeding system stocked with hay, sticks, and twigs
* Stacked blocks and plastic balls for climbing

Upon the detection of a 5033-IGUSHA event, a sleeping gas is to be administered to the cell. If necessary, SCP-5033 is to be sheared at this time.

A safe testing area is currently under construction, as SCP-5033 is suspected of having additional anomalous abilities.

**Description:** SCP-5033 is a Valais Blacknose sheep[[footnote]]//Ovis aries//[[/footnote]].

When stressed, SCP-5033 will go into a 5033-IGUSHA event. During a 5033-IGUSHA event, SCP-5033 will detonate with an energy equivalent to that of a kilogram of TNT every ten seconds. Notably, SCP-5033 is unaffected by the force generated by these detonations. The detonations are also not a stressor to SCP-5033. Upon significant relaxation, the 5033-IGUSHA event will then conclude.

**Discovery:** SCP-5033 was discovered in the Valais region of Switzerland after a number of reports concerning multiple explosions in the mountains. MTF Zeta-35 (&#34;Mountain Goats&#34;) was dispatched to the location, at which SCP-5033 was contained through the use of a tranquilizer. 

Near SCP-5033 was a charred human corpse carrying a rifle, later identified as Helmut Hammerschmidt, who was associated with a poaching organization dedicated to the hunting of potentially anomalous animals.

A notepad was discovered on Hammerschmidt&#39;s body, which contained data tracking certain animals and reports. The following entries were legible: 

&gt; Schmid&#39;s getting closer and closer to his so-called &#39;big discovery,&#39; and everyone is on his dick about it. He hasn&#39;t even revealed anything yet, I bet that fucker doesn&#39;t even have anything, just like all the other fakes. They&#39;re all just here for attention.
&gt; 
&gt; But I&#39;m gonna be going out to the mountains tomorrow. People have been talking about some interesting things up there, and my rifle&#39;s itching for some action. 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ll show him what a real &#39;big discovery&#39; is. Can&#39;t wait to see the look on his face. 

&gt; I hate climbing. All this goddamn equipment is heavy as hell. 
&gt; 
&gt; Every time I feel like giving up, I think about Schmid. About his dirty smirk. About everyone congratulating him. About how //I// can&#39;t let that happen. 
&gt; 
&gt; And I keep going. Fuck him.

&gt; The target is in my sights. A little sheep. It reminds me of something, but I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it.
&gt; 
&gt; It&#39;s eating sticks. Are animals supposed to eat sticks? Maybe it acts as fuel for its... powers? Still not sure what it does.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m gonna watch it for a bit. See if it does anything interesting. My camera is set up to track it. 

&gt; It&#39;s been a few hours, and I can&#39;t get Schmid out of my mind. Fucking asshole. 

&gt; I shot at the sheep. A warning shot. It started fucking exploding. 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ve struck gold. I bet it&#39;ll wipe Schmid&#39;s grin right off his face.
&gt; 
&gt; Just gotta shoot this thing dead. It&#39;s a shame, it&#39;s actually pretty cute. Maybe I can get it stuffed as a little trophy.

&gt; The bullets aren&#39;t doing anything. I&#39;ve shot it five fucking times. I think it&#39;s invincible to bullets.
&gt; 
&gt; I should get backup. But also... I don&#39;t want to go back. I bet Schmid would make fun of me for being a coward, or something idiotic like that. 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m gonna stab it. It only explodes every ten seconds, and the range isn&#39;t that far... I might be able to get up close and kill it.
&gt; 
&gt; Then I&#39;ll come back with its corpse, and I&#39;ll be a hero. I&#39;m so close...
&gt; 
&gt; I can&#39;t fucking wait.

Despite multiple bullet shells littering the ground and other evidence that Hammerschmidt had been firing at SCP-5033, no bullet wounds were found on the entity. Investigation into the poaching organization, as well as SCP-5033&#39;s suspected invulnerability to harm caused by hostile actions, is ongoing.
