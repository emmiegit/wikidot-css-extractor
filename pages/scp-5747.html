This is my gift for [[*user topdownunder]]. Hey, top! I made a story with your magic metal! I have no idea why I included so many drones. Spoilers for the end: [[span class=&#34;dblock&#34;]]Jeff Bezos unnaturally removes the Hephaesium, but does so successfully, whilst retaining its abilities. Jeff Bezos doesn&#39;t know at all of the life-giving quality of Hephaesium, and only wants it for the endurance. Now, these delivery drones act as severed parts of SCP-5747, returning to it, and giving it the power it needs to rise. Turns out, SCP-5747 is just this huge, Hephaesium mech that someone couldn&#39;t/forgot to finish. That&#39;s why the cave temp was so high.[[/span]]

**Item #:** SCP-5747

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The forest area surrounding SCP-5747 has been purchased by the Foundation, and been made to appear as a wildlife sanctuary zone. Two armed Foundation guards are to be monitoring the level-ground entrance of SCP-5747. Model B-10A[[footnote]]Semi-sentient micro drones with a set path. These drones have been altered to withstand extreme heat.[[/footnote]] micro security drones are to survey the inside of SCP-5747 to detect intruders/unexpected anomalies. Foundation researchers requesting entrance to SCP-5747 require a level 3 clearance, a heat endurance suit, and briefing from MTF Epsilon-09. Instances of SCP-5747-2 are to be stored in standard anomalous storage lockers when discovered.

**Description:** SCP-5747 is a vast underground cave in Greece. SCP-5747 is a spatial anomaly, taking up more space than it might seem from the outside. Temperatures taken thus far have been shown to exceed 150 degrees Celcius. The interior of SCP-5747 is covered with thin layers of SCP-5747-1.


[[include component:image-block name= http://scpdsandbox.wikidot.com/local--files/three-titans/CAVE |caption= //SCP-5747 after Foundation acquisition. (Underground entrance.)//|width=500px|align=center]]

SCP-5747-1 is a metal alloy by the name of //Hephaesium//.[[footnote]]Hephaesium is a metal alloy composed of multiple parts. Such as iron and beryllium bronze. Many elements found within Hephaesium are unknown. Hephaesium is used to build animate structures. One notable inclusion of Hephaesium is in [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-359 SCP-359].[[/footnote]] It is not currently known how SCP-5747-1 was created at this quantity and spread on SCP-5747&#39;s interior.

SCP-5747-2 are massive build-ups of SCP-5747-1, and are found to be suitable quantities to integrate into structures and other various items.

**Addendum 5747.1:** //Exploration and Discovery//

SCP-5747 was discovered after minor tremors were traced back to it, affecting the surrounding environment. While pursuing the anomaly with heat signature technology, it was quickly learned that regularly entering would not be possible. MTF Epsilon-9[[footnote]]A mobile task force specialized in combatting heat-related anomalies.[[/footnote]] was shortly contacted to continue exploration of SCP-5747.
@@ @@
MTF Epsilon-9 had suits fabricated from anomalous heat endurant material that could withstand such temperatures. This gear also included auxiliary cooling devices if the suits were ever compromised. As the entrance to SCP-5747 is deep inside a forest, MTF Epsilon-9 members were required to prepare before entry, and walk the rest of the distance, as the forest was too dense.

**Incident 5747.2:**

A week later, the Model B-10A drone resumed video feed. Presumably, it had known to preserve onboard power by staying powered off. When the coordinates of the location the drone had resumed its activities were being extracted, it was quickly discovered that they couldn&#39;t be discovered due to jamming.

**Jeff Bezos:** And what about you, Mark? What do you think?

**Mark:** Very cool metal.

From the context of the transcript, it has been concluded when stabilized at its melting point, Hephaesium can retain its anomalous properties until being forged into its next item. After the previous log, the Model B-10A drone flew to the heel of Jeff Bezos&#39;s foot and latched on, then powered down to preserve onboard battery life.

**Jeff Bezos:** So, how are we doing over here?

//The drone is facing downwards, to the floor once again. It quickly moves towards the southernmost wall of the room, maintaining height, and facing the back of Jeff Bezos.//

//The room, seems to be a small factory operation, with 3 total people, including Jeff Bezos.//

//Jeff Bezos is on a balcony, above the factory equipment and 2 workers. One notable piece of equipment in the room is a conveyor belt, with a metal frame on each side, being veiled by a black, rubber curtain. Above all the equipment, is a wide, half-circular window, overlooking a lake, with the sun setting in the distance.//

**Worker-1:** Almost finished, Sir.

**Jeff Bezos:** How close to finished may that be?

**Worker-1:** Nearing testing.

**Jeff Bezos:** (//Laughing//) Neat!

**Worker-2:** //(Shouting)// Just uploading the AI now, sir!

**Jeff Bezos:** Good, good.

//Worker-2 is holding a laptop with his left arm, and is working on the laptop with his other hand.//

**Worker-2:** Just finished.

//The conveyor belt in front of Worker-2 begins to move. A series of delivery-type drones are moved from the left of the belt, and into view. There are 9 in total when the belt ceases movement.//

**Jeff Bezos:** Oh hoh- nicely done you two!

//Jeff Bezos begins to move to a stairwell on his right. As he approaches the stairwell and traverses down it, the drone moves to where Jeff Bezos once stood.//

**Jeff Bezos:** When this project takes off, your names will be up in lights.

**Worker-2:** That&#39;s very kind og you, sir.

//Jeff Bezos reaches the lower floor where the workers are.//

**Jeff Bezos:** So, what do we have here?

**Worker-1:** We took the alloy you gave us, and coated it around the drones, giving them a nice shell.

**Jeff Bezos:** Sounds great, Stacey! Should we see what we&#39;re workin&#39; with?

**Worker-1:** I&#39;m actually Danielle, but-

//Danielle gestures to Worker-2.//

**Danielle:** Start them up.

**Worker-2:** Gotcha.

//Worker-2 taps his computer, and a whirring sound can be heard coming from the drones.//

//While this was happening, Foundation researchers were able to get access to the live communications feed between the delivery drones. See the log below.//

//The delivery drones fly upwards simultaneously.//

 **Jeff Bezos:** Woah!

//They all turn, to face the window.//

**Jeff Bezos:** I&#39;m impressed! This-

//The drones rapidly move up towards the window. Jeff Bezos ducks down, and the other two look in shock.//

**Jeff Bezos:** Holy fucking shit!

//The delivery drones crash through the window, and the Model B-10A drone quickly follows them outside.//

//The Model B-10A drone goes around the group of delivery drones, and faces them.//

After the previous logs, the Model B-10A drone entered another deactivation state, and latching on to one of the delivery drones, who were ultimately focused on their course.

//The Model B-10A drone has attached itself to the lower hull of one of the delivery drones, this time facing forwards.//

//Since the coordinates were not jammed, Foundation researchers were able to pull the location of the drones. They were back in Greece, above the forest where SCP-5747 was located.//

//The Model B-10A drone unlatches from the bottom of the delivery drone and rises above the group of drones.//

**Model B-10A:[[footnote]]From its onboard speaker.[[/footnote]]** {{BATTERY LEVEL LOW, PLEASE EXPEND MODERATELY.}}

//The group of delivery drones dip down into the trees below, the Model B-10A drone ensues.//

//They all arrive at the above-ground entrance of SCP-5747, and continue inside.//

//When inside SCP-5747, the delivery drones launch into the cave walls. Breaking sounds can be heard when the drones make impact with the walls.//

//In certain spots where the drones landed, the alloy on the walls of SCP-5747 appears to reach its melting point, then turning visibly hot.//

//The delivery drones then sink partway into the walls. The cave begins to quake, and small bits of the ceiling begin to crumble and fall.//

//The Model B-10A drone turns around, and quickly exits the way it came into SCP-5747.//

//The Model B-10A drone reaches level ground.//

//The ground begins to crack and separate.//

**Model B-10A:** {{BATTERY EXTREMELY LOW.}}

//The Model B-10A drone&#39;s video feed begins to blur. Large tremors cause the drone&#39;s camera to shake.//

//A large figure appears to rise from the ground.//
