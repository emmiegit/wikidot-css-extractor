**Item #:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2719 SCP-2719]-J

**Object Class:** Unfunny

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2719-J is to be kept inside --your mum--.[[footnote]] //Revision of the containment procedures pending review of the Ethics Committee upon expressing concerns over the failing structural integrity of the Secure Facility, as well as the obvious moral dilemma of keeping an elephant in a confined space.// - Dr. Izza [[/footnote]][[footnote]]Dr. Izza has been fired.[[/footnote]]

**Description:**  SCP-2719-J is a white adhesive nametag. The words &#34;HELLO, I AM an inside joke&#34; are present on the non-adhesive side, with &#34;an inside joke&#34; written on in what appears to be permanent marker.

When SCP-2719-J is attached to a surface or surfaces, its respective concepts become overwritten with &#34;an inside joke&#34;. The object loses all other meaning and context to anyone other than the individual who applied SCP-2719-J (hereby referred to as SCP-2719-J-1).[[footnote]] Although the subject can be just as easily referred to as &#34;the comedian&#34; or &#34;a barrel of laughs&#34;, if said as a sarcastic invective.[[/footnote]]

SCP-2719-J-1 therefore becomes the only individual who possesses knowledge of the object. This information is referred to as &#34;the punchline&#34;. The applicant can share the punchline with anyone to have them &#34;be in on&#34; the joke, which will cause them to become an instance of SCP-2719-J-1.

Individuals who are not in on the joke tend to become increasingly frustrated when left out, partly due to the knowledge that the information is typically accessible with ease and partly due to a mild cognitohazardous effect. It is not uncommon for subjects to experience other extreme emotional responses, including but not limited to boredom, awe, confusion, and fear, or any combination of these. More information can be found below.

**Addendum 2719-J:** Experimentation Data.

//Note: Tests were carried out in Testing Site Alpha of Conceptual Containment Facility-22, with Dr. Hubert Graham supervising a team of two researchers and three D-Class personnel.//

|| **Action** || **Outcome** ||
|| Dr. Graham applies SCP-2719-J to containment chamber door. || Everyone but Dr. Graham becomes distressed, insisting that there is no way out of the room. Graham is seen laughing to himself as group becomes increasingly agitated. No one else is able to identify the door, Graham claiming it was &#34;an inside joke&#34;, therefore &#34;they don&#39;t understand.&#34;||
|| Dr. Graham tells D-68129 in secret that SCP-2719-J is on a door. || D-68129 doubles over laughing. D-68129 tells other personnel in room that SCP-2719-J is on a door. D-68129 summarily shot for ruining the joke.[[footnote]] &#34;Don&#39;t look at me like that, he deserved it! Punk-ass...&#34; - Dr. Graham [[/footnote]]||
|| Dr.  Graham removes SCP-2719-J from containment chamber door and applies it to the back of D-33671&#39;s shirt. || D-33671 suffers mild panic attack attempting to remove shirt without understanding what it is or how to do so. Dr. Graham reports pain in sides.||
|| Dr. Graham removes SCP-2719-J and applies it to D-33671&#39;s forehead.  || Terrified personnel attempt to kill what they don&#39;t understand.[[footnote]] //Whoops// - Dr. Graham [[/footnote]] ||
|| Dr. Graham applies SCP-2719-J to a perfect cube of solid, room-temperature air.[[footnote]]Don&#39;t ask.[[/footnote]] || No survivors, aside from Dr. Graham.[[footnote]] //Whooooooooops// - Dr. Graham [[/footnote]] ||
|| Dr. Graham applies SCP-2719-J to his arm and introduces himself to the new researchers. || &#34;Hello, an inside joke, I&#39;m dad.&#34;[[footnote]]Onsite nuke detonated.[[/footnote]] ||
|| Dr. Graham&#39;s five-year-old daughter applies SCP-2719-J to a collage she is making for her father while he&#39;s recovering in the infirmary. || &#34;What the fuck is this?&#34;[[footnote]] &#34;You call that art, kid? [to orderly] Whose [REDACTED] do I gotta play with to get some godDAMN morphine in here??&#34;[[/footnote]]||
|| Dr. Graham removes SCP-2719-J from POS artwork and applies it to [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-in-a-box-j SCP-????-J&#39;s box]. || At least fifty-eight new conceptual puzzles have appeared on SCP-????-J&#39;s container. Box is now antimemetic, --we think--.[[footnote]] //What in god&#39;s name did you do?!?// [incoherent screaming] - Site Director Belushi [[/footnote]] ||
|| SCP-2719-J is applied to Finland.  || It turns out, Finland is not a real country. Not only is it not a real country but there is actually no landmass there at all, and the space between Sweden and Russia is actually empty ocean. Now I realize that this notion seems ridiculous but that is why the conspiracy works, and why people are afraid to speak out against the existence of Finland, so I would ask you to approach the evidence I put forward here with an open mind. Finland was first created some time during the Cold War between Russia and the West. It was also around this time that environmentalism and the idea of preserving our planet was really taking off, and it is due to both of those things that two of the main players in the Finland conspiracy came to work closely with each other, Russia and Japan. Japan-Soviet relations had always been shaky at best, but also incredibly secretive. Even as early as 1925 Japan and the Soviet Union had secret deals with each other regarding fishing rights between the two countries, with the Soviet Union giving up much of it&#39;s fishing rights to Japan with seemingly no explanation as to why. These secretive treaties and alliances continued right up until just before the fall of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev made trips to Japan months before the fall of the Soviet Union stating the entire time how the relations between them were improving, even when Soviet relations with the rest of the world were worsening. In fact the entire past 100 years of Japanese-Russian relations bring up many unanswered questions. Why at the height of WW2, were the battles between these two countries minimal despite being on opposing sides? Why did Japan sign a peace treaty with Russia in 1941, just months before their allies, Germany, went to war with Russia? Why were relations between Japan and Russia always good throughout the Cold War, despite the major geopolitical differences between the countries, and close geographical positions that you think would cause tensions? The answer is simple, they shared a common secret. A common asset that worked in both of their favours. And that asset was Finland. It&#39;s unclear when Finland was first thought up, some say it was during the Cold War, and others say it was as far back as the 1920&#39;s, but the necessity of Finland is quite simple. Japan can fish in the region of ocean between Sweden and Russia without worry for environmental repercussions, after all, nobody&#39;s going to expect fishing regulations to be broken in a place where everyone thinks there&#39;s a landmass will they? And in return Russia get a percentage of the fish to distribute amongst their populace. It&#39;s a simple case of fishing the Finnish Sea, transporting it across Russia, (that was the real reason for the construction of the Trans-Siberian railway by the way), and then shipping it from the Eastern Russian coast to Japan under the disguise of &#39;Nokia&#39; products. This is why Nokia is the largest &#39;Finnish&#39; company, and it is also why Japan is the largest importer of Nokia products, despite the fact that very few people own Nokia phones in the country. There are clearly some unanswered questions to this conspiracy that I&#39;ll try and address below. 1- What about Finnish people? Are they all in on the conspiracy? A. No. People from Finland genuinely believe they&#39;re from Finland. In reality they are from small towns on either the Eastern part of Sweden, the Western part of Russia, or the Northern part of Estonia. 2- What about all of Finland&#39;s other exports other than Nokia? A. Finland&#39;s three biggest, and three most well known areas of industry are Oil, Tech, and Software. The oil is gathered in offshore platforms where the rest of us believe the landmass of Finland is, (again the Japanese get to avoid rigging regulations in this respect), the Tech companies have already been explained above with the Nokia post, and Software companies can easily redirect their IP Address through the Finnish sea. As for other Finnish exports, well, claiming Santa comes from your country isn&#39;t a viable way to get people to believe in it. 3- What about Helsinki? That is an enormous city on the world stage. A. Helsinki is located in Eastern Sweden. It&#39;s not like the people flying there would notice. 4- What about everywhere else in Finland? There&#39;s a lot to it and it couldn&#39;t all be made up. A. 99% of Finland is forest. A lot of it doesn&#39;t need to be accounted for when addressing Finnish geography. 5- Why do other countries go along with it? A. At first it was a sign of goodwill between Western Countries and the Soviet Union. A bargaining chip that could be played. But Finland has since evolved to something much more. An idealistic placeholder for what countries should aspire to. No real country could so consistently place first in Education, Healthcare, Gender Equality, Literacy Rates, National Stability, The least corrupt government in the world, Freedom of the press. It&#39;s a concept for countries and people to aspire to. But that&#39;s where the problems about Finland&#39;s existence is disputed. no country in the world can possibly be that good. 6- Why the name Finland? A. The country was originally made for fishing. What do fish have? Fins. Thus Finland. 7- What about the Finnish language? A. Look up the similarities between Japanese and Finnish. It may surprise you how similar they are. Which is weird considering the vast distances between them. 8- I&#39;m Finnish and your attack on my people and culture is insulting. A. I&#39;m not insulting Finnish people or culture. I don&#39;t even deny that there is Finnish culture. When you have a collective of a few million people identifying as Finnish then of course a culture will be built around it. I&#39;m simply saying that that the landmass of Finland isn&#39;t actually there. It doesn&#39;t mean there can&#39;t be a culture or identity of being Finnish however. 9- This is an enormous conspiracy to keep secret, how could nobody else of realized it? A. Other people have realized it. But imagine the ridiculousness of the statement &#39;I don&#39;t believe Finland exists&#39;. Even if we did have undeniable proof of something put in front of us we would still hold the opinion that most of our friends, family, and acquaintances hold to not disrupt social convention. It&#39;s part of the human condition. 10- What about GPS and Satellite Images? A. Manipulated and forged. In the parts of Estonia, Sweden, and Russia that are allocated as &#39;Finnish zones&#39; the GPS locations are changed to match that of Finland. __Satellite images can be forged__.||

//I kind of lost my train of thought, but the point I&#39;m trying to make here is that **__Finland__ __does__ __not__ __exist__**. Hey, that could make a great skip.//
