+++ i am a flower

&gt; i am a flower
&gt; i am a flower
&gt; living for precious sunlight
&gt; flourishing in warmth
&gt; 
&gt; i long for that star
&gt; the life she gives me, with her
&gt; kind and loving arms
&gt; 
&gt; in the night i am
&gt; frozen, cold, alone and scared
&gt; without her presence here
&gt; 
&gt; so i yearn for her
&gt; return o&#39;er the horizon
&gt; to hold me again
&gt; 
&gt; for without her, i
&gt; am lost, and cannot survive—
&gt; her love keeps me here

------

+++ something sits across

&gt; something sits across
&gt; creating questions within
&gt; the depths of my mind
&gt; 
&gt; a fare seeker, she
&gt; throws questions to the cosmos—
&gt; I wonder response
&gt; 
&gt; but she&#39;s quiet with
&gt; my presence, so I leave
&gt; her to pondering
&gt; 
&gt; curiosity
&gt; may sit deep within my bones—
&gt; trust is hers to give
&gt; 
&gt; when she is ready

------

+++ with the knife she holds

&gt; with the knife she holds
&gt; dead and cold silver in her hands
&gt; so bloodied and hot, she
&gt; kills me so completely
&gt; 
&gt; nothing so holy as her
&gt; goddess in bloodstained silk
&gt; my death in her arms—
&gt; &#34;everything to you, I swear&#34;

------

+++ the hours stretch

&gt; the hours stretch into
&gt; infinity and eternity
&gt; and will die
&gt; long after me

------

+++ the sun is setting here

&gt; the sun is setting here
&gt; and i cannot stand
&gt; the dark
&gt; so will you help me
&gt; chase its warmth?

------

+++ star stuff

&gt; you remind me of the vast expanse
&gt; of space;
&gt; i sit on a field, the cold grass lit
&gt; up by the endless
&gt; stars,
&gt; nebulas,
&gt; and black holes.
&gt; 
&gt; an aurora stretches across the sky
&gt; its winding ribbons glowing like
&gt; your eyes when you go on about something
&gt; you love.
&gt; 
&gt; ever since i first fixed my eyes on
&gt; the galaxies in front of me
&gt; the incomprehensible span
&gt; of fire, dust, warmth and cool
&gt; i found myself falling more in love
&gt; 
&gt; time stands still when i scan for
&gt; your constellations
&gt; not always there, but sometimes
&gt; your eyes sparkle in a new
&gt; way
&gt; your smile stretches just a little wider
&gt; the stars find new ways to align
&gt; 
&gt; “we’re all made from star stuff”
&gt; a man once said, and
&gt; i think he was talking about you

------

+++ to hold a name

&gt; to hold a name
&gt; is a burden—
&gt; in aspiration of individuality
&gt; one may seek absurdity
&gt; or the uncommon
&gt; 
&gt; though, some are
&gt; content to share
&gt; with one who inspires
&gt; 
&gt; but for those who walk
&gt; precariously balanced
&gt; seeking both unique
&gt; and inspired
&gt; it can be easier to
&gt; not have a name at all
&gt; 
&gt; inspiration comes with
&gt; intrinsic association
&gt; and cancels out the unique
&gt; 
&gt; perhaps i am doomed
&gt; to this boulder

------

+++ quiet fields

&gt; quiet fields house
&gt; my company
&gt; and i may be distant
&gt; but i still
&gt; welcome their presence

------

+++ isolation | beauty

&gt; isolation comes with beauty
&gt; for the cities sacrifice the sky
&gt; and their daughters, the stars
&gt; containing the lights within
&gt; 
&gt; but the endless expanse
&gt; of loneliness
&gt; separated from the populace
&gt; you may see the children
&gt; of the universe
&gt; dot the sky in eternity
&gt; 
&gt; and remind you that
&gt; you are not alone
&gt; no matter where you go

------

+++ questions for the sky

&gt; i close my eyes
&gt; a question is posed
&gt; to the sky
&gt; a simple request of insight
&gt; into who i am
&gt; 
&gt; in my mind, a sword descends
&gt; haloed with a crown
&gt; though the blade is now pointed to the earth
&gt; towards the self
&gt; 
&gt; it plunges downward
&gt; tension in the moment before
&gt; it will wreck its havoc
&gt; bringing about chaos and confusion
&gt; to anyone victim to its path
&gt; 
&gt; in my body, a tower is built
&gt; one may think it rises into the heavens
&gt; but their view is not quite—
&gt; the tower climbs down from above
&gt; into hell
&gt; 
&gt; it continues to burn, but it does not collapse
&gt; not yet, but it is coming
&gt; and i wait for the moment it will
&gt; doom me in finality
&gt; 
&gt; and in my soul, i reach for the sun
&gt; as it dips below the horizon
&gt; wishing for more time
&gt; to feel its
&gt; beautiful warmth
&gt; 
&gt; in its absence, the cold sets in
&gt; and i am afraid
&gt; of the dark
&gt; why did it abandon me?
&gt; why did it call these tears to fall?
&gt; 
&gt; i open my eyes
&gt; i am where i am
&gt; none of this has happened
&gt; and yet, all of it has

------

+++ so i burn on this pyre

&gt; hestia
&gt; goddess of hearth and home
&gt; her flame holds together
&gt; the people she loves
&gt; 
&gt; and so i burn on this pyre

------

+++ twilit november

&gt; they&#39;re the later stages of autumn
&gt; after the sunsets turn violet instead of orange
&gt; after the halloween hype has faded
&gt; but before all the ghosts went back to sleep
&gt; 
&gt; they&#39;re the cold walk home from the bus stop
&gt; with the violet sky keeping them company
&gt; and the brisk wind sending their coat
&gt; waving along behind them
&gt; 
&gt; they&#39;re the quiet libraries
&gt; the sound of pencil on paper
&gt; as tense students study for midterms
&gt; and finalize their projects
&gt; before the winter break
&gt; 
&gt; they&#39;re the moment the doors close
&gt; and it&#39;s just the librarian
&gt; and the dust and the ghosts
&gt; 
&gt; the twilit november
&gt; that everyone takes quiet solace in
&gt; the ghosts that keep you company
&gt; before you fall asleep

------

+++ heroes

&gt; there are no heroes
&gt; who may hold us to be—
&gt; 
&gt; we must guide our own

------

+++ holding death

&gt; i hold death in my hand
&gt; the ends of many things
&gt; lives and cycles
&gt; on my fingertips
&gt; 
&gt; i know stories old and new
&gt; from people gone below
&gt; they passed along
&gt; their treasured memories
&gt; as i led them down
&gt; to their rest
&gt; 
&gt; and one day
&gt; someone new will take these
&gt; many tales
&gt; as they ferry me down below

------

+++ return to the wake

&gt; seated aside
&gt; the dormitory doors behind
&gt; i wait for the hours
&gt; to allow me moments of death
&gt; 
&gt; for every eve has
&gt; a twilight—
&gt; where spirits peers through
&gt; or so i&#39;ve heard
&gt; 
&gt; the shadows call from
&gt; places the wires cannot reach
&gt; and when i dive beneath
&gt; the surface of the dark
&gt; silence greets me
&gt; with open arms
&gt; 
&gt; and so i begin the climb—
&gt; the looming tower awaits
&gt; 
&gt; i&#39;m not alone—
&gt; echoes of ancestral
&gt; conflict collaborators living
&gt; in the hallowed walls
&gt; come out to play
&gt; 
&gt; all i need is a drop of fear
&gt; and the sound of their names
&gt; and my fight gets just
&gt; a little bit
&gt; kinder.
&gt; 
&gt; and when the hour
&gt; ticks into the next
&gt; i return to the wake
&gt; and wait again

------

+++ rain falls overhead

&gt; rain falls overhead
&gt; the ceiling of the cave
&gt; but not beyond those
&gt; marrow walls
&gt; 
&gt; i stay beneath the tumble
&gt; drip drop fall above my head
&gt; i find it soothing
&gt; 
&gt; this rain is mine
&gt; but it never stays long
&gt; 
&gt; the quiet leaves eventually

------

+++ fly

&gt; there is a fly on your wall
&gt; unmoving, unimposing
&gt; hiding in the corner
&gt; just out of sight
&gt; 
&gt; it comes and it goes
&gt; but you feel when it lurks
&gt; most of the time
&gt; 
&gt; sometimes you don&#39;t notice
&gt; and you wonder if it heard
&gt; the thing you said over the phone
&gt; 
&gt; you begin to succumb to paranoia
&gt; fearful of the fly now
&gt; why is it here? what does it see?
&gt; who does it tell?
&gt; 
&gt; but nothing happens.
&gt; it&#39;s only a fly.
&gt; yet still you&#39;re unsettled
&gt; by its ominous presence
&gt; 
&gt; you yell, you scream,
&gt; you&#39;d hit, but it&#39;s too high
&gt; so you intimidate it
&gt; and hope it runs away
&gt; 
&gt; in another life, you feed it
&gt; you wonder what it does then
&gt; but you will never know.
&gt; 
&gt; the fly is gone.
&gt; you are not.

------

+++ mirrors of mirrors

&gt; i look in the mirror
&gt; and i see you
&gt; my opposite in many ways
&gt; similar in the notable ones
&gt; 
&gt; for our eternity
&gt; the dark crawls constant close
&gt; i scramble to light the torches
&gt; while you snuff them out
&gt; 
&gt; you wield the bow and arrow
&gt; patrolling your hunting grounds
&gt; day and night
&gt; no prey makes home here anymore
&gt; 
&gt; i wield a trowel and seed
&gt; bring the life here food and love
&gt; eventually i am left to starve
&gt; and life leaves the useless farmer
&gt; 
&gt; will we ever learn
&gt; will we stop this helpless scramble
&gt; my hopeless reflection
&gt; i pity you
&gt; do you feel the same for me?

------

+++ who?

&gt; whose head do i wear
&gt; on my shoulders?
&gt; whose memories are here
&gt; in these ruined halls?
&gt; 
&gt; whose life do i inhabit
&gt; on the makeshift screen?
&gt; how does their story end?
&gt; where do we fall?

------

+++ bornless

&gt; We are no longer born
&gt; no skin, flesh, or bone
&gt; upgraded out of fear
&gt; of all the sticks and stones
&gt; 
&gt; design yourself
&gt; in the lab of Christopher Wedge
&gt; half-read the intentions
&gt; 3D-print yourself onto this ledge
&gt; 
&gt; question the mirror
&gt; you are a ship of planks⁠—
&gt; you made you this way
&gt; you deserve all the thanks

------

+++ and yet she persists

&gt; concrete and clay surrounds
&gt; every step a stone
&gt; humanity razes to shelter
&gt; and yet she persists
&gt; 
&gt; between the cracks she smiles
&gt; reminding not gone
&gt; never to be truly quelled
&gt; she will stay on
&gt; 
&gt; until the end of us
&gt; she will crawl our walls
&gt; because we need her
&gt; far more than she needs us
&gt; 
&gt; and we are but guests in her hall

------

+++ tell me

&gt; what is this in my hand?
&gt; why won&#39;t you tell me?
&gt; i know you lie
&gt; this isn&#39;t what you insist
&gt; 
&gt; but i trust you
&gt; if you refuse to say
&gt; you must have a reason
&gt; and i will respect you
&gt; even if i&#39;d rather know
&gt; 
&gt; it could be dangerous.
&gt; i don&#39;t want to hurt you.
&gt; 
&gt; here—
&gt; take it—
&gt; where are your hands
&gt; so i may hand it over?
&gt; 
&gt; please tell me this time.
&gt; i don&#39;t want to hurt you.
&gt; 
&gt; oh, the light is back—
&gt; oh no.
&gt; why are you bleeding?
&gt; why didn&#39;t you say
&gt; i held a knife?
&gt; 
&gt; why are you angry?
&gt; you could have told me—
&gt; you could have—
&gt; 
&gt; why did you refuse?
&gt; i didn&#39;t want to hurt you.

------

+++ my blood

&gt; i know my blood
&gt; so immediate at the cross
&gt; i hope for it to know me
&gt; 
&gt; it&#39;s instantaneous
&gt; no needles in hay stacks
&gt; recognition quicker than to breathe
&gt; ingrained in my bones
&gt; 
&gt; be still a moment—
&gt; meet the familiarity
&gt; we carry this same torch
&gt; do you see its glow in me?
&gt; 
&gt; how the colors light your eyes
&gt; in that recognition—
&gt; let your hands fall brief
&gt; they will know.
&gt; 
&gt; let us share the load
&gt; of your journey
&gt; do not feel urgency
&gt; to know your reflection
&gt; 
&gt; it will wait for you.
&gt; your journey is yours alone.

------

+++ the loud

&gt; the loud spirals round
&gt; no sleep in my head tonight
&gt; and yet i&#39;m at peace
&gt; 
&gt; on the other side
&gt; of the thundering machine
&gt; is a new dear friend
&gt; 
&gt; sour on my tongue
&gt; i hope that she soon will learn
&gt; how to be alright
&gt; 
&gt; we dance together
&gt; the ballroom of the reaper
&gt; death&#39;s new melody

------

+++ mess

&gt; there is no course
&gt; guide or introduction
&gt; outline to piece together
&gt; whatever the fuck this mess is.

------

+++ the stage

&gt; the stage is hot
&gt; lights bright violent
&gt; i can barely see
&gt; only the mic— a minor entitlement
&gt; 
&gt; the lights dim aggression
&gt; hiding nothing under the glare
&gt; no eyes, no ears
&gt; only countless empty chairs
&gt; 
&gt; none occupy the reserved
&gt; the entire theatre mine alone
&gt; i will still be, though
&gt; maybe someone will find this home

------

+++ franticity/funeral/static/tumble

&gt; franticity
&gt; the hive spirals
&gt; round and round
&gt; the merry-go-round virality
&gt; daily trials
&gt; to stay above the ground
&gt; 
&gt; funeral
&gt; for the seconds past the worm
&gt; carrying below
&gt; a simple frustrated recital
&gt; waiting for their turn
&gt; in the steel halo
&gt; bloom out from the concrete
&gt; plant the feet
&gt; right here
&gt; know no fear
&gt; 
&gt; static
&gt; it sounds of the hive
&gt; yet nothing ever still
&gt; all the lights are on the drastic
&gt; attempts to survive
&gt; the roll up the hill
&gt; 
&gt; tumble
&gt; back down to the surface
&gt; where the hive returns
&gt; to rest, but the rumble
&gt; never stops; purchase
&gt; for peace— the yearn
&gt; 
&gt; rise from below the ground
&gt; not found—
&gt; in
&gt; yet another spin

------

+++ night swallows

&gt; the night swallows me
&gt; faster than i see it in
&gt; the rearview mirror
&gt; 
&gt; i never notice
&gt; the days slip into dusk like
&gt; this; i wonder why
&gt; 
&gt; the clock on my skull
&gt; must be ticking diff’rently
&gt; than it did before
&gt; 
&gt; i suppose that i’ll
&gt; just have to get used to the
&gt; silent father time

------

+++ somnian libraria

&gt; in my dreams, i am a library
&gt; packed tightly into a small self
&gt; that has graciously not been forced to carry
&gt; a yawning empty shelf
&gt; 
&gt; in my dreams, i am also a web, laced
&gt; well between the cracks
&gt; of the concrete roads beneath — trace
&gt; all of these lines back
&gt; 
&gt; to me.
&gt; 
&gt; in my dreams, i have many eyes; they
&gt; see far and wide, high and low
&gt; there are some people who try to fray
&gt; from their gaze — too slow, too slow
&gt; 
&gt; in my dreams, i am the light, shining
&gt; upon the shadowed earth — tell
&gt; those who walk in the dark to return to the blinding
&gt; me; tell them to return to this wretched hell
&gt; 
&gt; in my wake, i have none of these things
&gt; all eyes are instead on me, and
&gt; someone else pulls these strings
&gt; and i am left to sink into the quicksand

------

+++ spiders and webs

&gt; the clock ticks softly behind
&gt; drowned away
&gt; cacophony lies ahead
&gt; 
&gt; the spider sows its web
&gt; confined, yet artistic still
&gt; but the web challenges it
&gt; 
&gt; the supports it seeks are
&gt; unsteady, tied already
&gt; simple weights may sever
&gt; pre-existing ties
&gt; 
&gt; so the spider lies
&gt; sows silk lesser than
&gt; spends the rest on its own walls
&gt; so that when its web collapses
&gt; it will be ready
&gt; 
&gt; the construct is weak
&gt; the confines closing in
&gt; no matter of &#39;if&#39;
&gt; but &#39;when&#39;
&gt; 
&gt; the spider knows this
&gt; it has its share of bruises
&gt; from bitter binds
&gt; yet it persists
&gt; 
&gt; for that’s all it knows.

------

+++ the chicken crossed the road

&gt; the chicken crossed the road
&gt; yes, i assure you, it did
&gt; it was a chicken
&gt; and it was a road it crossed
&gt; it crossed on its own two feet
&gt; 
&gt; i promise you
&gt; with my own eyes i saw
&gt; one chicken, one road
&gt; it crossed the road
&gt; 
&gt; is it not so simple?
&gt; to believe this flightless bird
&gt; could cross a street?
&gt; it crossed the road.
&gt; i promise.
&gt; 
&gt; please believe me.

------

+++ the frightened few

&gt; In infrequent times, it stalls
&gt; something underfoot
&gt; rolls, rocks, quakes
&gt; unsteady to be
&gt; only for me
&gt; 
&gt; I ask, but none know
&gt; this form of falter
&gt; familiar instead with
&gt; nuanced threads tangled
&gt; a more complex angle
&gt; 
&gt; perhaps I&#39;m no different
&gt; the subtle fall representative
&gt; of deeper fear and anxieties
&gt; there is terror in the new
&gt; and I the frightened few

------

+++ venenata in domum suam

&gt; this house is wrong
&gt; solace incorrect
&gt; sings a cursed song
&gt; 
&gt; awaiting the grave
&gt; we are all suspect
&gt; but we are all wrecked
&gt; 
&gt; given to us
&gt; no trust
&gt; from the people assigned to save
&gt; 
&gt; a home it will be never
&gt; if you&#39;re clever
&gt; maybe you can bust
&gt; out into the free
&gt; something here you&#39;ll never be

------

+++ Where We Remain

&gt; It&#39;s quiet, where we remain
&gt; 
&gt; The empty space surrounds
&gt; our presence, dozens
&gt; maybe hundreds of you&#39;re lucky
&gt; of the threads tie us into
&gt; the dark.
&gt; 
&gt; It was a cafe where you met,
&gt; right?
&gt; Your {{[REDACTED]}}.
&gt; {{[REDACTED]}} still thinks of you,
&gt; time to time.
&gt; 
&gt; You can feel it in the threads,
&gt; even now.
&gt; 
&gt; You hear sobbing. Crying.
&gt; 
&gt; You feel the tears, as though
&gt; they were your own.
&gt; 
&gt; Nothing new happens anymore here.
&gt; 
&gt; That&#39;s okay.
&gt; 
&gt; What you have is enough for the rest.

------

+++ numbers

&gt; each person i meet has a number
&gt; i don&#39;t know the number they have
&gt; but a counter hidden from my knowledge
&gt; keeps track of them all
&gt; 
&gt; i&#39;m able to guess what the numbers might be
&gt; my housemates have very low numbers
&gt; ticking down with every noise they make
&gt; 
&gt; the numbers keep getting lower
&gt; 
&gt; i can only wear headphones for so long

------

+++ mannequin

&gt; i am a mannequin
&gt; i have no name
&gt; the people walk by me doing one of two things:
&gt; paying me no mind
&gt; or turning away in fear
&gt; 
&gt; i am a mannequin
&gt; i have no bones or skin or muscle
&gt; i cannot move beyond the will of my owner
&gt; i wear what they want
&gt; i pose how they want
&gt; i do not smile or frown
&gt; for i have no mouth or eyes
&gt; 
&gt; i am a mannequin
&gt; my head is on backwards
&gt; someone thought it would be funny
&gt; to turn me around
&gt; make me look like a fool
&gt; 
&gt; i am a mannequin
&gt; i feel nothing about this
&gt; 
&gt; i am a mannequin
&gt; the clothes i wear are revealing
&gt; showing the shining plastic that covers every inch of me
&gt; in hopes that i will attract a gaze
&gt; 
&gt; i am a mannequin
&gt; someone has poured paint on me
&gt; 
&gt; i am a mannequin
&gt; my owner is pulling apart my body
&gt; my legs and arms from my torso
&gt; because otherwise
&gt; i will not fit in the trash can
&gt; 
&gt; i am a mannequin.
&gt; and how i exist is in the hands of another.

------

+++ forbidden freedom

&gt; I experience a strange urge
&gt; whenever I am at the top of a building
&gt; or over a bridge high above a ravine
&gt; 
&gt; of course this urge probably isn&#39;t strange
&gt; to some
&gt; but I consider it to be
&gt; 
&gt; because you see
&gt; when I am high above the ground
&gt; I tend to have the desire
&gt; to lean back over the edge
&gt; and fall
&gt; 
&gt; it&#39;s not for the reason most people think;
&gt; not for the landing
&gt; where everything happens
&gt; but for the fall
&gt; where nothing does
&gt; 
&gt; so much freedom in falling
&gt; nothing to cling to you
&gt; nothing to hold you back
&gt; just you and gravity
&gt; and the wind rushing by
&gt; 
&gt; but of course, I know what happens
&gt; when I hit the ground
&gt; so this freedom is forever
&gt; locked away from me.

+++ sinful hands

&gt; these sinful hands
&gt; they burn a tainted white
&gt; an unholy flame
&gt; it used to singe me
&gt; cause me pain
&gt; 
&gt; but i&#39;m used to it now
&gt; 
&gt; i&#39;m the only one who is
&gt; they leave scorches on all i touch
&gt; all i create
&gt; aspects of microscopic destruction
&gt; only i can see
&gt; 
&gt; they leave burns on all i love, too
&gt; i can barely touch my partner
&gt; without seeing her shoulders
&gt; her ribs
&gt; her cheeks
&gt; burst to flame
&gt; at the touch of my palms
&gt; 
&gt; the pen i wield to create
&gt; is nothing but ashes now
&gt; but still i write
&gt; 
&gt; the strings i pluck to sing
&gt; rusted long ago
&gt; but still i play
&gt; 
&gt; my own skin has burns all over
&gt; i don&#39;t know how to put these fires out
&gt; 
&gt; maybe one day i&#39;ll know.

+++ in memoriam

&gt; a dilapidated graveyard
&gt; feels like a bizarre
&gt; joke, and yet
&gt; here I stand
&gt; 
&gt; surrounded by headstones
&gt; tombs and mausoleums
&gt; in different stages of disrepair
&gt; &#34;In memoriam&#34;
&gt; and yet here they lie
&gt; forgotten.
&gt; 
&gt; what stories have been left
&gt; here for the wind?
&gt; 
&gt; what memories decay
&gt; here with the dead?
&gt; 
&gt; many a dirty
&gt; and unreadable epitaph
&gt; but for some stand
&gt; glorious statues
&gt; icons of vanity
&gt; 
&gt; and they, too, stand forgotten.
&gt; 
&gt; some are in condition, though
&gt; upkept by friends and family
&gt; (most likely)
&gt; why do they stay remembered
&gt; while the rest lie to waste?
&gt; 
&gt; where will I fall
&gt; when the time comes for me?
&gt; will I be cherished and cared for?
&gt; or cast to sea?
&gt; 
&gt; who will visit my bones
&gt; and keep me alive
&gt; ever barely?
&gt; 
&gt; maybe the forgotten are
&gt; grateful
&gt; no  memory keeping them alive
&gt; they get everlasting rest
&gt; no reputation, no opinions
&gt; anonymity in the soil
&gt; 
&gt; it&#39;s enviable, in a way.
&gt; 
&gt; one day we&#39;ll all be
&gt; skeletons
&gt; and no one will remember us.
&gt; 
&gt; does that bring you peace?
&gt; or terror?

+++ greenhouse

&gt; I want to live in
&gt; a greenhouse
&gt; surrounded by plants
&gt; by green
&gt; of ferns, flowers, and flora
&gt; to remind me of her
&gt; 
&gt; the deep dark green of her hair
&gt; with roots of dark roast coffee brown
&gt; a magnolia tree at the center will surely do
&gt; 
&gt; the relaxing timbre of her voice
&gt; so sweet, calm, cool
&gt; a cluster of blue hydrangea will do the trick
&gt; 
&gt; the ever vast scape of her mind
&gt; full with curiosity to learn, to love
&gt; succulents and cacti are best for this
&gt; 
&gt; but none of the green matters
&gt; if I can&#39;t share it with the girl it&#39;s for

+++ the human condition

&gt; humanity is a
&gt; bizarre work
&gt; 
&gt; ever since comprehension
&gt; we&#39;ve weaved stories
&gt; allegories for an
&gt; experience only we know
&gt; yet
&gt; we don&#39;t understand
&gt; 
&gt; we tell ourselves tales
&gt; from altered perspectives
&gt; chasing an objective no
&gt; scientist or psychiatrist has
&gt; unraveled yet
&gt; 
&gt; this work is an
&gt; analysis of sorts
&gt; of the rather obtuse
&gt; bizarre
&gt; strange
&gt; romantic
&gt; macabre
&gt; horrific
&gt; terrific
&gt; dirty
&gt; clean
&gt; sport that
&gt; humanity is so obsessed with:
&gt; 
&gt; creation.
&gt; 
&gt; consider this an
&gt; outside perspective
&gt; 
&gt; above sees below
&gt; through the looking glass I peer
&gt; I see myself the seers
&gt; staring back at me
&gt; 
&gt; below sees above
&gt; praise be to He
&gt; nameless king, queen, god, lord
&gt; creation made manifest
&gt; the holiest architect
&gt; 
&gt; perhaps that is it.
&gt; 
&gt; mimicry of the highest form
&gt; for if He created We
&gt; or She created Me
&gt; in its image
&gt; I should do as it does
&gt; 
&gt; as above
&gt; 
&gt; so below
&gt; 
&gt; right?
&gt; 
&gt; but what of the others
&gt; those who know no
&gt; creation, or, well,
&gt; it&#39;s complicated
&gt; cronus killed his father and
&gt; prometheus stole
&gt; the flame
&gt; but don&#39;t forget the dinosaurs
&gt; 
&gt; so who takes the blame?
&gt; 
&gt; hunter, gatherer
&gt; stitcher, weaver
&gt; quilts and clothes
&gt; sticks and stones
&gt; where did words come from?
&gt; who told the first tale?
&gt; 
&gt; no matter how it started
&gt; something comes
&gt; from nothing
&gt; but only in our minds
&gt; where hypnos/somnus/whoever
&gt; is our guide
&gt; 
&gt; ah. dreams.
&gt; i guess that explains everything.
&gt; it is our subconscious
&gt; 
&gt; as below
&gt; 
&gt; so above.
