The demiurge who made the world
Screamed with all its might.
It did its very best to make 
Its realm devoid of light — 
But no one cared, because back then,
There was no wrong or right.

Then MEKHANE, who witnessed this,
It wasn&#39;t pleased at all
To see a god so hideous
With humans in its thrall — 
And so it gave the humans will,
The will to be appalled.

The sea was wet as wet could be, 
And Gyaros, dry as dry.
A dreadful fight was yet to come
In ancient times gone by.
No birds were flying overhead
(They didn&#39;t want to die.)

The Karcist and the Mekhanite 
Were walking close at hand; 
They wept like anything to see 
The pure and virgin sand — 
&#39;If this were only plagued with filth!&#39;
The Karcist did demand.

&#39;If seven tons of putrid flesh
Upon the beach were poured,
Do you suppose,&#39; the Karcist said — 
The other&#39;d hear no more.
&#39;Machines,&#39; exclaimed the Mekhanite,
&#39;Those would improve the shore!&#39;

&#39;O humans, come and be my slaves!&#39; 
The Karcist did beseech. 
&#39;A raging fight, a show of might, 
Along the bloodstained beach:
We&#39;ll do away with Mekhanites
And godhood, you will reach.&#39;

The eldest human heard his voice
And ran and hid in dread,
He sacrificed a goat to Zeus, 
And as the creature bled,
&#39;Deliver us from Karcist beasts!&#39;
Unto the sky he pled. 

The other humans hurried up — 
Their minds were not their own.
They donned their mail of tumor-plates
And sharpened spears of bone,
And on the surface of their skulls,
A thousand eyes were grown.

The Karcist and his new recruits
Marched on a mile or so, 
Until they met the Mekhanites,
With robot gods in tow.
The great colossus at their side
Let out an eerie glow.

&#39;The time has come,&#39; the Karcist said, 
&#39;Surrender to the flesh,
The blood, the dark contagions,
The claws that slice and thresh,
And horrors none the world has seen
Since ancient Erikesh!&#39;

&#39;But wait a bit,&#39; the servants cried, 
&#39;Before the havoc wreaks,
It seems we&#39;re not equipped to face
Their mechanized techniques.&#34;
The Karcist ate their souls with rage — 
He had to cull the weak.

&#39;You killed your fighting force, you oaf,&#39;
The Mekhanite exclaimed.
&#39;It only serves to prove the reason
You&#39;ll go down in flames:
Intelligence and reasoning,
To you, are marks of shame.&#39;

But Ion&#39;s reinforcements came
From temples underground,
Constructed from unearthly flesh
That wheezed with sickly sound.
The cannons blazed, the venom poured,
&#39;Til not a soul was found.

&#39;O Karcists,&#39; said the Foundation.
&#39;We thought your time was done
When Gyaros fell to MEKHANE!&#39;
But answer there came none — 
And this was scarcely odd, because 
[REDACTED] everyone.</textarea></pre>
