**Item #:** SCP-4851

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4851 instances are to be terminated on sight. Due to their differing anomalous properties, personnel should consult each instance&#39;s sub-object documentation before engaging. 

Culling of SCP-4851 populations is to be done with an emphasis on containment. No efforts to encroach upon territory held by SCP-4851 instances shall be made. Protection of existing civilian populations is top priority.

**Description:** SCP-4851 collectively designates the members of an ecological community residing in an approx. 0.6 km^^2^^ area of Alaska, United States of America. As of 2050-08-31, SCP-4851 instances have been recorded to be members of 108 different subspecies of common flora and fauna found in the area. It is of note several of such species are invasive to the area.

SCP-4851 instances demonstrate a wide range of behavioral, anatomical, and biological anomalies. However, the following shared traits exist:
* Resistance to substances normally toxic to non-anomalous specimens, including lead (II) and (II, IV) oxides (PbO, Pb,,3,,O,,4,,), benzene (C,,6,,H,,6,,), and sulfur dioxide (SO,,2,,).
* Increased fertility.
* Acceleration of currently understood evolutionary processes in response to environmental changes, with significant observable changes often occurring within one generation.
* Hostility towards humans and manmade structures.

**Addendum 4851-1:** Observed Anomalies in Selected Species

||~ **Parent Species** ||~ **Common Name** ||~ **Observed Anomalies** ||~ **First Discovered** ||
|| //Oncorhynchus gorbuscha// || Pink salmon || A previously undiscovered type of epithelial cell in the gills facilitates the extraction of hydrogen ions from the water, creating free protons to fuel the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria throughout the body.[[footnote]] Likely an adaptation to rapid acidification of their natural habitat. [[/footnote]] || 2040-04-22 ||
|| //Picea mariana// || Black spruce || Anomalous reactions in chloroplasts allow the derivation of glucose from polyethylenes during the Calvin cycle. || 2041-05-30 ||
|| //Ovis dalli// || Dall sheep || Presence of three separate digestive cavities in the gut, allowing the digestion of woody plants.[[footnote]] Alpine vegetation, the Dall sheep&#39;s usual food source, has been almost wholly taken over by woody plants due to increasing temperatures. [[/footnote]] || 2042-11-16 ||
|| //Mimulus guttatus// || Monkey flower || Seeds attach to concrete surfaces. Upon germination, organism releases enzymes into the ground around it that dissolve concrete into its individual aggregates. Release of phosphorous-containing compounds facilitate the growth of other plants in the vicinity.|| 2043-01-06 ||
|| //Myodes rutilus// || Northern red-backed vole || Primarily live underground. Claws are developed for ideal burrowing. Individuals burrow en masse underneath manmade structures, often causing foundational instability and eventual collapse. This process often traps the vole underground, resulting in its expiration. || 2047-10-09 ||
|| //Canis lupus pambasileus// || Interior Alaskan wolf || Thinning of nasal epithelium results in significantly enhanced sense of smell. Significant elongation of frontal canine teeth. Engorged masticatory muscles allows specimens to bite through extremely tough substances, including body armor. Lower aversive reactions to painful stimuli.|| 2049-02-23 ||

**Addendum 4851-2:** On 2050-09-04, Foundation Sites in South Africa detected the presence of anomalous native animals akin to SCP-4851 instances. On 2050-10-11, the same phenomenon was observed by Sites stationed in India. Such animals were observed encroaching on civilian population centers. Loss of life in these areas totaled an estimated 150,000.

SCP-4851 threat level upgraded to ##red|●## Red.

**Addendum 4851-3:** On 2050-12-25, at the behest of the Global Occult Coalition, members of the United Nations negotiated the Moscow Agreement as a means of developing a global plan of action to contain SCP-4851. Article 1 is attached below.

{{(b) Pledging each Party&#39;s economic and military assistance in the Coalition&#39;s ongoing efforts to exterminate UTE-1015 instances,}}

{{(b) Establishing global surveillance channels that allow quick identification of areas where UTE-1015 is present in, and therefore swift extermination before such organisms are allowed to proliferate,}} 

{{(c) Authorizing global nuclear proliferation in preparation for deployment in areas with particularly high population densities of UTE-1015 species.}}
