The **United States Penitentiary, Paranormal Administrative Maximum Facility**, also called **Paranormal ADX** or simply **Paramax**, is an administrative maximum security federal prison designed and constructed to contain inmates of a paranormal or occult nature. Located in an artificial orphan universe, Paramax has no permanent connection to the mainline universe, making it inaccessible and inescapable without knowledge of its exact ontological coordinates. A combination of architectural sorcery and STOP reality anchors prevents the prison from deconceptualizing into the Outside, and allows for the safe incarceration of reality benders, demigods, psychics, and thaumaturges.

Paramax is the only federal prison suitable for long-term incarceration of major parathreats, and one of the few facilities of its type in the world. As a result, it also contains prisoners from the Paranatural Warfare Command[[footnote]]The Department of Defense unified combatant command for paranormal operations, commonly called the Pentagram.[[/footnote]], the Correctional Service of Canada, IKEA, and other American and allied paranormal agencies. Although these partners provide supplementary funding on a per capita basis, most expenses are paid for from the Federal Bureau of Prisons black budget, and the prison is operated solely and entirely by the Unusual Incidents Unit.

++ History

Prior to 1940, the federal government of the United States possessed no facilities suitable for the long-term detention or imprisonment of individuals of an occult or paranormal nature. While the idea of paracrime was not new, the prevailing conception of paracriminals was of mundane or near-mundane humans engaged in illegal paranormal activity, reflecting the focus paid to the Chicago Spirit[[footnote]]Active from 1895 to 1938, for much of its history the Chicago Spirit was the largest paracrime syndicate in the Western Hemisphere. It was the target of numerous operations by the Bureau of Prohibition and the Bureau of Investigation, and was the ultimate impetus for the formation of the Unusual Incidents Unit.[[/footnote]] by the nascent Federal Bureau of Investigation and its Unusual Incidents Unit. In the rare instances where the federal government found itself needing to detain an innately paranormal individual, the task was outsourced to specialist contractors, primarily the American Secure Containment Initiative[[footnote]]A private paranormal research and defense agency predating the Sixth Occult War, and one of the first dedicated normalcy organizations. During the Paranormal Renaissance which followed the Sixth Occult War, the ASCI merged with a number of similar organizations which believed that the defense of consensus normalcy could not be left solely in the hands of the national agencies of the great powers, creating the international, non-aligned normalcy organization now known as the Foundation.[[/footnote]] and its successor, the Foundation.

Matters changed in 1940 as a result of two events: (1) the signing of the Howard-Grant Agreement with the United Kingdom and the subsequent ratification of the Three Portlands Free Association Compact, which placed the [[[three-portlands-hub|city-state of Three Portlands]]] under undisputed American jurisdiction; (2) the formation, by executive order of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, of the United States Domestic Security Council to provide unified political oversight over American paranormal policy and law. Now tasked with policing the largest paranormal free port in the Western Hemisphere, the UIU soon found itself dealing with a large number of new paracriminals who were paranormal by nature, rather than offense, and could not be safely housed within the conventional prison system.

Initially, this problem was solved by incarcerating the new parahuman prisoners in Three Portlands, relying on existing municipal facilities where possible and employing other parahumans as guards. However, this approach was complicated by local resentment of the American government and the FBI, which generated significant resistance from the city government. The reliance on municipal jails was relieved, albeit temporarily, when the United States joined the Seventh Occult War[[footnote]]The last and most recent global occult conflict, roughly coinciding with the Second World War. The primary belligerents were the Ahnenerbe Obskuracorps of the SS and their allies in the Thule Society, and the diverse coalition of nation-states and paranormal interests that formed to oppose them, which was initially led by the British Occult Service and the Reformed Templar Knights.[[/footnote]] and assumed responsibility for the majority of Allied Occult Initiative[[footnote]]The precursor to the Global Occult Coalition, formed to coordinate the Allied war effort in the Seventh Occult War.[[/footnote]] prisoners of war; the terms of the Howard-Grant Agreement had allowed the AOI, via the British Occult Service[[footnote]]The primary paranormal agency of the United Kingdom and the British Empire, and an early major power in the establishment and maintenance of consensus normalcy.[[/footnote]], to hold prisoners of war from the occult conflict in Three Portlands, and several internment camps had been constructed on the outskirts of the city to this end. With the American entry into the conflict, control over these prison camps was transferred to the UIU, and most existing paracriminal prisoners were relocated to these facilities.

This solution was //ad hoc// and deeply flawed, as evidenced by five separate prison riots between 1942 and 1945, including one in 1943 that coincided with the Battle of Portlands[[footnote]]This riot, which occurred simultaneously with the Siege of ICSUT, tied up significant American and Allied forces within the city, and almost resulted in the capture of ICSUT Portlands by the Obskuracorps; only the timely intervention of the Golem of Prague allowed the defenders to rally and break the siege.[[/footnote]]. By the time the Occult War ended in 1945, it was clear that a permanent solution was needed; the end of the war had swelled the ranks of parahuman detainees with captured Obskuracorps agents and Thule battlemages, many of whom could not be executed due to the risk of hostile necromancy. Moreover, even more prisoners of war were being held by the Foundation and other AOI members, who expressed reluctance to continue doing so in the long-term.

After protracted negotiations overseen by President Harry Truman and Domestic Security Advisor Moses Howard, an agreement was reached whereby the UIU would assume responsibility for all of the remaining prisoners captured during the Occult War and in the immediate post-War manhunts. In exchange, the Foundation and the newly-chartered Global Occult Coalition would lend their technical expertise in constructing a suitable permanent prison facility, which would also be used to detain American paracriminals. Prometheus Labs was selected as the primary construction contractor, and work on the prison began in 1946, concluding in 1947.

The prison was constructed inside of an artificial pocket universe, which was anchored via Way to the existing federal prison on Alcatraz Island. The new penitentiary was given the designation Paranormal ADX, but quickly came to be called Paramax. Orlando Hugo Harding was named the first warden, and oversaw the transfer of the prison&#39;s first inmate, the powerful Obskuracorps battlemage Konrad Weiss, from Foundation custody.

Several expansions and upgrades of Paramax would be performed over the subsequent decades, with the most significant occurring in 1963, when the Alcatraz prison was closed. Rather than maintain the anchor to Alcatraz Island or relocate the endpoint, the permanent Way was deliberately collapsed, orphaning the prison&#39;s pocket universe and casting it adrift in the Outside. A new system of entry and exit was implemented, relying on thaumatological contagion-links between a set of prototype targets to aid in the calculation of the prison&#39;s ontological coordinates and allow the creation of temporary Ways to and from Paramax. Major improvements were made to the prison&#39;s reality anchors in order to allow it to survive untethered in the Outside, which consequentially allowed for the incarceration of much more powerful reality benders and deific entities.

Paramax is considered to be one of the most secure facilities in the multiverse, rivaled only by the [[[secure-facility-dossier-lunar-area-32|Foundation&#39;s Lunar containment site]]] and the [[[goc-tale-sequence-farpoint|GOC&#39;s Farpoint Station]]]. As of 2024, no prisoner has ever escaped from Paramax, and no one has ever entered without authorization.

----

++ Facilities

Paramax is located within an artificial orphan pocket universe. Topologically, this universe is a sphere half-a-mile in diameter, which terminates in a discrete discontinuity with Outside unspace. This boundary with the Outside is perceived as a blank white void, although in reality it is both featureless and conceptless. Anything which crosses this boundary is immediately deconceptualized. Gravity is equivalent to Earth standard, and is oriented perpendicular to and towards the equatorial plane. There is no natural light.

The most prominent feature of this universe is the Rock -- a single piece of cratonic granite, approximately 750 yards in length and width and 50 yards deep, upon which the entire prison is built. The Rock was apportated in its entirety directly from the Earth&#39;s crust to its current position, in what was then the largest peacetime act of thaumaturgy ever performed[[footnote]]Over 100 mages of the Global Occult Coalition, all of them veterans of the Seventh Occult War, participated in the working, which also required the deployment of 23 of the 25 largest Everhart Resonators in existence at the time. The backlash from the working was disguised as nuclear fallout from the ongoing Operation Crossroads.[[/footnote]]. The nature and composition of the Rock give it exceptional conceptual solidity, offering a firm foundation for the architectural sorcery of the prison and acting as a low-grade natural reality anchor.

The cornerstone of the prison&#39;s security and onto-structural integrity are the set of nine Spatial, Temporal, and Ontological Protection (STOP) anchors distributed throughout the complex. These massive reality anchors define and enforce the spatial and temporal dimensions of the prison, prevent metaphysical conceptual modification, and inhibit reality bending by anything less than a fundamental demiurge. They play a critical role in preventing the prison&#39;s deconceptualization into the Outside, reinforcing the realness of the Rock to make Paramax ontologically self-sufficient. The STOP anchors incorporate a large number of blackbox and/or classified paratechnologies, not all of which have known origins: the temporal technology of the anchors is derived from a Xyank Anastasakos Constant Temporal Sink, a device apparently provided by [[[welcome-to-delta-t|causally displaced agents of a time variant Foundation]]]; isotope analysis of the beryllium-bronze alloys used in several critical components suggests that Prometheus Labs received some of the finished parts or raw materials from an adjacent multiverse; at least one of the anchors is known to have been manufactured entirely via metafictional methods.

Since the collapse of the Alcatraz Way, access to Paramax has relied on the Contagion Target Prototypes: a set of conceptually inert silver cubes which have been bisected, with the halves divided between Paramax and facilities in the United States. Each half of a Target Prototype is thaumically linked to the other half as a result of the Law of Contagion[[footnote]]One of the fundamental laws of Unified Thaumatology, commonly stated as: &#34;The part affects the whole.&#34;[[/footnote]]. Using this link, federal thaumaturges can calculate the relative ontological coordinates of Paramax, and can then open a temporary Way between the prison and the baseline universe. The Earthside halves of the Prototypes are distributed among the highest security federal facilities; the Paramax halves are kept under constant guard in the central Transit Room, and can be immediately destroyed to force the prison into lockdown -- although this is a last-resort contingency, only to be used in the unlikely event of a total loss of control of the prisoner population.

While Paramax does receive regular shipments of supplies from the baseline universe, for most purposes, it is fully self-sufficient. The prison&#39;s proximity to the Outside, and the weakness of the barrier to unspace, makes it easy to perform metaphysical manifestation of raw concepts from the void between universes, so long as it does not conflict with the reality enforced by the STOP anchors. Paramax possesses several simple conceptual generators, which are used to produce basic and generic supplies from platonic concepts; these generators are hardwired to only be capable of producing a limited set of food, clothing, and other essential supplies, and cannot be easily modified to create contraband -- although even if they were, they would be rendered non-functional by the STOP anchors.

Although Paramax was constructed with the intent that it be used to hold the most dangerous parahuman criminals, it has since become the primary federal prison facility for any paracriminals that cannot easily be handled by conventional penitentiaries, regardless of reason or parahuman status. As a result, it now has a low-security wing -- dubbed the Presidential Wing, in reference to its most famous inmate -- which is broadly similar to a normal prison. It is used to house mundane or near-mundane paracriminals who have proven resistant to amnestics or geases, or whose very existence poses a threat to the Veil. The Presidential Wing is the only portion of the facility that permits personal visitors, albeit rarely and under extremely limited circumstances.

The majority of the prison&#39;s inmates are housed in the two medium-security wings, which are designed to contain wizards, psychics, minor reality benders, and other parahumans with limited paranormal abilities. Anti-occult sigils, psionic dampeners, and other specialized countermeasures are worked into the architecture of the medium-security wings, allowing for the safe incarceration of moderate parathreats in an otherwise conventional prison environment with shared cells and common areas. Additional countermeasures may be present in specific cells, but most prisoners that require custom restraints are placed into maximum security.

Prisoners kept in the maximum-security wing are battlemages, major reality benders, demigods, and others whose paranormal abilities exceed their humanity -- while some of them may technically be human, the power at their disposal has warped their worldview to be fundamentally alien. Many of them do not recognize any human authority at all, and are consequently serving life sentences. Most prisoners in maximum security are kept in individual cells, with countermeasures tailored to their specific abilities. Interactions between prisoners are rare, and tightly monitored when they do occur. The most dangerous prisoners are kept in indefinite solitary confinement, but the majority have regular contact with the guards and prison psychiatrists.

----

++ Administration

All Paramax staff and guards are members of the UIU, although only a few are active Special Agents. The psychological fortitude and knowledge of the Veil required mean that most staff are recruited from other normalcy organizations, or from paranormal enclaves such as Three Portlands. Prison staff live and work within Paramax for months at a time, and frequently have to deal with some of the worst people and non-people in the federal prison system. As a result, despite the lucrative salary and benefits offered, turnover is high.

Many members of the staff are themselves parahumans, although the percentage of thaumaturges and psychics is lower than in the rest of the UIU -- the same countermeasures that keep the prisoners contained also neutralize the occult and paranormal abilities of the guards. As a result, parahumans with abilities based in abnormal biology or technology, and even mundane humans, are preferred over those with more esoteric capabilities.

Regardless of individual abilities or attributes, all security staff are armed with advanced paraweaponry, allowing them to deploy both lethal and non-lethal force even against major parathreats. Non-security personnel are not routinely armed, and are required to be accompanied by security staff while outside administrative areas. Visitors and outside personnel, including Special Agents, are prohibited from carrying weapons inside the prison, and must be accompanied by security staff at all times. UIU agents may visit the prison pursuant to active investigations, but visits for any other reason, and visits by non-agents, require the explicit prior approval of the Warden.

+++ Warden

]]

The current Warden is Ulyssa van Kann, who was appointed in 2015. A half-gorgon from the New Amsterdam gorgon clan, Van Kann served with the 23rd Paranatural Operations Group[[footnote]]A Pentagram Army combat unit, specializing in asymmetric warfare utilizing paratech and parahuman assets against parathreats and other irregular warfare units.[[/footnote]] in Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. While with the 23rd, Van Kann engaged in combat operations against [[[two-between-the-eyes|agents of the Organization for the Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts]]][[footnote]]The Iranian national paranormal agency, which is active throughout the Middle East. Although hostile to the Taliban, ORIA agents took advantage of the Coalition invasion to operate opportunistically throughout Afghanistan, frequently coming into conflict with both sides.[[/footnote]], djinn insurgents, rogue ghouls, and other parathreats. She was seriously injured by an IED during a mission in Kandahar, resulting in the loss of her left hand and both eyes. Although she received advanced prosthetics to replace these losses, she was given a medical discharge from the Army, and subsequently joined the UIU as an irregular agent. She was assigned to Paramax in 2012, and quickly rose to become Security Chief under Warden Corcoran, eventually replacing him after exposing his corruption.

Warden Van Kann is noted for her strict approach to command and discipline, her willingness to lead from the front and by example, her attention to and familiarity with the details of the duties of her subordinates, and the exacting standards she demands from herself and her staff. Her term as Warden has seen a sharp increase in turnover among guards and prison staff in their first six months at Paramax, accompanied by an equally sharp decrease in turnover among long-term staff -- those who can function within Van Kann&#39;s system tend to function well, and the operating efficiency of the prison is at the highest level it has ever been. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, she remains deeply unpopular with other elements of the UIU, especially those who have to regularly deal with her and her uncompromising attitude.
