+++ From the Journal of Aframos Longjourney, Pilgrim

+++ Erevday, Twentieth Cycle, Seventh Year, 81st Turn
++++ Fifty-Sixth Day in the Trees

My temper remains frayed.  I snapped at Torne again today.  He refuses to keep still.

We are camped in a cave for the expressed purpose of keeping him still while I see to his arm.  If he keeps moving, he will injure himself again.  If he will not keep still, I may need to tie him.  When he is not ignoring my advice, he is talking.  He found a stone deep in the cave that excites him.  It has a shell impressed in it.

I am sure that I would find it fascinating myself, were I not so worried that he might injure himself further.  It is a spiral, something like the great shelled homes in Pella Veypal.  He keeps talking about an ancient sea, and millions of years of mud[[footnote]] There have been a number of fossil finds in the Ravelwoods, most notably brought back by the Greepley-Fxantha expedition.  They are interesting, but ultimately, such study is difficult at best, given the differences in strata throughout the woods, making it impossible to group fossils of different areas by age. [[/footnote]].  That is all of interest, to be sure, but if he does not take care of his arm, which I took great trouble to set, I may sit on him to keep him still.

Indeed, at times I feel as though I am caring for a very young conlin.  I know that he is an adult, but I feel responsible for him when he acts foolishly.  

I will wait until he has been still a while before telling him about the broken stone with the crystals within[[footnote]] A geode, perhaps? [[/footnote]].</textarea></pre>
