**Item #:** SCP-2538

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** No weapons, armor, or other items generated by SCP-2538, are allowed outside of the containment chamber. At least 2 security personnel must guard SCP-2538 at all times. Security officers will rotate in shifts accordingly.

**Description:** SCP-2538 is a large van with a set of seats in the back, along with several containers. The vehicle has several crude steel plates attached to the sides and windows. SCP-2538 has no visible license plating and manufacturer labels. Due to this, manufacturer and previous owner of SCP-2538 are unknown. The left side of the vehicle has a spray painted rectangular symbol with the letters &#34;R. S.&#34; written below.

When opened by an outside source, several objects will appear inside SCP-2538&#39;s back compartment. The objects known to appear include:

* 4 sets of tactical bullet resistant vests
* 4 loaded M4A1 carbine rifles
* 2 bags of plastic explosives
* 4 masks depicting various animals[[footnote]] The animal depicted on the masks are random. Common appearances include arachnid and insect species.[[/footnote]]
* 20 magazines of 5.56x45mm NATO cartridges 

Upon opening SCP-2538 again, a new set of the aforementioned items will appear, and will cause all previous items to disappear, regardless of where they are. Any objects placed inside SCP-2538&#39;s back compartment will also disappear once a new set is created. Any damage to SCP-2538 is repaired once the object is outside of human sight-lines.

The Foundation first discovered SCP-2538 in a warehouse owned by the company &#34;Cargo-Partner&#34; on the edge of Belgrade, Serbia. SCP-2538 was recovered along with a phone hidden inside the vehicle&#39;s glove compartment. After recovery the incidents of violent crime in Belgrade decreased.

**Addendum 2538/01 02/04/10:** The phone recovered from SCP-2538&#39;s glove compartment contained several audio recordings. Each recording dated from 3 months, to 2 days before recovery. These recordings are accessible by personnel of level 2 clearance and above.

&gt; **Caller Name: Dragan**
&gt; 
&gt; Hey Marco, I got some extra parts from that saleman. You could use them better then he could. I&#39;ll be stopping by the warehouse in 2 hours, I&#39;ll talk with you there.

&gt; **Caller Name: Dragan**
&gt; 
&gt; Nice job on the car Marco, just got the photo you sent me. I&#39;m heading to a quick meeting of sorts, going to get us a quick job.

&gt; **Caller Name: Dragan**
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ve set up a job for the new van. It involves the local bank and whatnot. I&#39;m calling up an old friend of sorts as we speak to help us out. I&#39;ll call you back when I can.

&gt; **Caller Name: Dragan**
&gt; 
&gt; Alright, I&#39;ve made us a deal. This syndicate has deep pockets Marco, and we both could use the extra dinars. They&#39;re going to send you a call soon, listen to the Representative, and do what he says. He doesn&#39;t know about the van, was hoping to spring that as a surprise on him, make it worth his while yes?

&gt; **Caller Name: R.S Rep.**
&gt; 
&gt; Allow me to introduce myself, I am Markov of the Richter &#34;Corporation&#34;. You and your partner&#39;s work has gotten our attention. With the success of this deal, I&#39;m happy to welcome you as one of our workers. Your vehicle will be useful in our endeavors. It will save us a fortune, and I thank you for it personally. I&#39;ll call you when you are needed, remember your place Mr. Vukovic.

&gt; **Caller Name: Markov**
&gt; 
&gt; Marco, due to recent events regarding loss of our product, we ask that you do not use your vehicle for our work. We have lost approximately 30000 dinars worth of &#34;tools,&#34; and &#34;batteries,&#34; due to your choices. If you wish to repeal this, please schedule an appointment with me at once. Remember, your place, Mr. Vukovic.

&gt; **Caller Name: Markov**
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Vukovic, my organization has drafted a special offer for you. One of our many clients has expressed interest in your vehicle, specifically a man by the name of &#34;Viktor&#34; who works with our Scarlet division. If you wish to accept this request, please report to your warehouse tomorrow  at 2:00PM with the vehicle in tow. Thank you in advance, any concerns should be addressed at the deal.

&gt; **Caller Name: Dragan**
&gt; 
&gt; Marco, MARCO! Listen, Marco you...shit listen you need to get out of town or something, just anything! The Syndicate has it in for us apparently, they want your van...they&#39;re...shit. One of their men just tried to kill me, so I don&#39;t have my time friend, you need to get out of the city, find some way to destroy or hide or...shit I just had an idea. Find a way to get your van into the hands of those secret society creeps you keep hearing about, the ones that you said steal away and contain weird supernatural things. I don&#39;t know how just...get their attention or something. I...I think this is goodbye Marco, stay safe my friend.

&gt; **Caller Name: DO NOT ANSWER**
&gt; 
&gt; Marco, you were never much use to us anyway. We&#39;ll find that van of yours, we&#39;ll trace your signal until we find you, and I will make sure you do not dodge a bullet like your friend Dragan did for a moment. You could have had a prosperous life Marco, but I&#39;m afraid this is good bye forever you Serbian rat. I eagerly anticipate your body bag arriving at Viktor&#39;s footsteps soon. Until then, I hope I never see you.

Research is currently underway regarding the &#34;Richter Syndicate&#34; mentioned in the recordings. Whereabouts of &#34;Marco&#34; or other POIs are currently unknown.
