This is Noktigo&#39;s author page.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2715 SCP-2715] - My first SCP. I know I probably could have done better with this one, but given that 2715 was a shitty oc of mine first, I think I did an okay job with what I had.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3715 SCP-3715] - My second SCP. I&#39;m proud of this one. I think posting it right after the 3000 contest made a difference. Remember to time your postings right, kids. Also, the tea wall I took the picture of is no longer up. RIP tea wall, 2016-2017.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3915 SCP-3915] - My third SCP. There was originally supposed to be a tale to accompany it, but progress has been slow going. Stay tuned.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3575 SCP-3575] - My fourth SCP, and probably the most personal. All pictures for this one were taken on-location, and, if you went there, you could probably find all the things I took pictures of. 

Noktigo is known as Avocadonut (or variants thereof) on IRC. Feel free to contact him from any channel.</textarea></pre>
