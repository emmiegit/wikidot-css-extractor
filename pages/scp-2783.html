**Item #:** SCP-2783

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Complete information regarding SCP-2783 is restricted to individuals with Level 5 Security Clearance. Physical access to SCP-2783 is likewise restricted to personnel with Level 5 Security Clearance and requires Overseer permission. Personnel assigned to SCP-2783 must undergo appropriate amnestic therapy upon reassignment. Exploration must be carried out by personnel qualified in basic extradimensional exploration procedures. Standard non-hostile environment exploration equipment and supplies are required for all explorations. Man-portable exploration drones, man-powered vehicles (such as bicycles), and other surveying equipment may also be permitted on a case-by-case basis.

**Description:** SCP-2783 is an extradimensional anomaly accessible through the door of the former Laboratory 37 of the [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/aiad-homescreen|Artificial Intelligence Wing]]] at Site-43. Individuals who cross the threshold of Laboratory 37[[footnote]]Such individuals will be referred to as &#34;subjects&#34; for the remainder of this article.[[/footnote]] will be transported to a location outside of regular three-dimensional space.[[footnote]]Machine exploration does not trigger this anomaly. Also of note is the fact that Laboratory 37 may only be accessed through remotely-operated machines at this time.[[/footnote]] GPS tracking devices identify the location as existing in a tomb in southern Iraq. Foundation archaeologists have identified several artifacts connected to at least two previously undocumented pre-Mesopotamian civilizations at this site. Joint Foundation-ORIA quarantine of the area was put into effect shortly after discovery.[[footnote]]As a result of sociopolitical conditions in the region of the tomb, abandonment of this site and evacuation of personnel is currently under consideration. Remote monitoring of the location would continue in this contingency.[[/footnote]] No physical evidence of SCP-2783 has been uncovered at this location to date.

The interior of SCP-2783 visually resembles a graveyard. Subjects manifest inside of a fence approximately 1 meter past a gate; walking through this gate returns subjects to the Artificial Intelligence Wing at Site-43. Subjects have reported a variety of disparate, mutually exclusive conditions within SCP-2783.[[footnote]]This disparity exists even when there are multiple subjects within SCP-2783.[[/footnote]] These disparities include climate and meteorological conditions within SCP-2783, generally conforming to contemporary seasonal conditions typical of the current subject&#39;s place of birth, or a locale they strongly culturally identify with. All graves in SCP-2783 are near-uniformly marked, with markers again conforming to customs typical in the current subject&#39;s place of birth. Many subjects have noted an apparent similarity to military graveyards. All epitaphs and other markings are in the current subject&#39;s native language. All graves have, to date, remained consistently dedicated to the same or similar persons.

Graves will always appear in square grids, 300 graves to a side, 90,000 graves per grid. For ease of documentation, grids are assigned a two-letter designation with individual graves given a numeric designation. For a full map of the interior of SCP-2783 with current grids and grave numbers, consult Document SCP-2783/B.

The number of graves increases at a seemingly arbitrary rate, with the apparent borders of the graveyard expanding to accommodate these changes and new grids beginning as necessary. At time of writing, SCP-2783 contains an estimated one million graves. The border of SCP-2783 is a fence or other marker that also conforms to customs from the current subject&#39;s place of birth. All attempts to pass this barrier to date have failed. The apparent climate outside the borders of the graveyard appears to match the climate within.

Ground-penetrating radar tests indicate that approximately 30% of graves contain human remains; the remaining 70% are unoccupied. The significance of this is unknown.

**Origins/Recovery:** On 13 October ████, simultaneous Containment failures of on-site copies of SCP-[[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]079[[/span]], SCP-[[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]2522[[/span]], and SCP-[[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]2999[[/span]]-[[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]A[[/span]] occurred as cognition testing was being conducted with [[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]Marvin[[/span]].aic and experiments were being conducted with SCP-[[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]1073[[/span]] samples. Recovered data and audio logs and security footage indicate that SCP-███, SCP-████, and SCP-████-█ had pre-coordinated the containment breach through as-yet undiscovered means. While a full timeline of events has not yet been established, it has been determined that ██████.aic and SCP-[[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]1073[[/span]] provided assistance to site security that proved essential in limiting damage caused by the mass breach. ██████.aic was rendered inoperable, all SCP entities were neutralized, and three site security personnel were killed as a result of this incident.

Following the recovery of the remains of the deceased site security personnel, materials relating to the terminated SCP entities and AI construct were moved to a secure locker within Laboratory 37. Following the conclusion of the incident investigator&#39;s shift, the Laboratory was locked. When maintenance personnel attempted to enter the Laboratory in order to inspect and clean it, the anomaly was triggered and site security notified.

Following initial explorations into the anomaly, current containment procedures were put into effect with Level 5 security measures being effected following more extensive exploration.

**Exploration Log 926:**

[[collapsible show=&#34;&gt; Does the Black Moon Howl?&#34; hide=&#34;&gt; Does the Black Moon Howl?&#34;]]

{{&gt; The Black Moon howls in mourning for lost children as the survivors arm themselves for war.}}

+++ Level 5 Security Clearance credentials accepted. Your access has been logged with RAISA. Welcome, Overseer.

On 15 October 2017, a routine exploration of SCP-2783 was being carried out by Agent Phillip McClean when Agent McClean noted the presence of multiple humanoid entities previously not encountered in SCP-2783. These entities were captured by audiovisual recording equipment.

There were 13 total entities recorded, six seemingly female and seven seemingly male. Racial/ethnic profile of the entities was not apparent from either the recording or Agent McClean&#39;s testimony. All entities manifested in close proximity to a new grave marker near the border of SCP-2783&#39;s interior. All entities wore identical black dress coats and slacks, grey dress shirts, and black ties. All coats bore a coat-of-arms patch on both shoulders consisting of a white circular shield with three equidistant protrusions; inside the shield were three equidistant black arrows piercing a white circle outlined in black. All entities additionally wore black-and-white peaked caps bearing the same insignia on the face.

Unlike all previous new gravestone manifestations, there was a grave in front of the marker, dug approximately 1.8 meters deep. Six of the entities manifested bearing an unadorned casket; the seven remaining entities manifested carrying bolt-action rifles of unknown make. The entities were recorded marching in a tight formation to the gravesite; upon reaching the gravesite, the entities bearing the casket methodically lowered the casket into the grave as the entities bearing rifles stepped aside in single file, assuming the position of &#34;Present Arms&#34; upon stopping. When the entities lowering the casket completed, they rendered hand salutes as the entities bearing rifles carried out a three-volley salute. Following this, all entities marched in single file to the gate of SCP-2783, where they demanifested. Upon later inspection, the new gravesite appeared undisturbed.

Breakdown of the inscription on the grave marker is included below:

||~ Grave Number||~ Name Inscribed||~ Epitaph||~ Notes||
||AM-21530||&#34;Captain Kari Michelle Hollis, Mobile Task Force Zeta 9&#34;||&#34;She died in a strange and faraway place with a smile on her face, a weapon in her hand, and foes on all sides. She exemplified what all warriors should strive to be.&#34;||Exploration 926 occurred 48 hours following the extrication of over a dozen Foundation personnel from [[[SCP-1730]]] immediately prior to its neutralization. Captain Hollis went missing during this extrication and is presumed killed in action. It is unknown at this time if the remains interred in SCP-2783 correspond to Captain Hollis. Possible exhumation is currently under Ethics Committee review.||
