**Item #:** SCP-7575

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Any direct contact with SCP-7575 is forbidden. Permission for authorized Level 3 personnel to converse with the entity by way of radio transmission must be approved by no less than a two-thirds vote from the Overseer Council. Movement within, exploration of, and testing within 7575-Omega must also be approved by the O5 Council; all approved interaction with 7575-Omega is to be conducted using VB-2 model remote-operated drones.

SCP-7575&#39;s primary containment chamber is to be comprised of concrete, 14 meters thick, lined with steel. Personnel assigned to SCP-7575 (including D-Class) are to remain outside of the 16-meter red zone around SCP-7575. The majority of the chamber will be subterranean, being a vertical construction resembling an inverted cone, with a height of 30 meters. The chamber will gradually taper until it terminates at a radius of 6 meters^^3^^. The ceiling, which will also be flat, terminates at 17 meters^^3^^. The interior is to be suspended in complete darkness at all times, save for a single Disney-Pixar Toy Story 3 &#34;Buzz Lightyear&#34; LED night light, which SCP-7575 may activate via a switch at its own discretion.[[footnote]] Night light is connected to a secondary on-site generator within the L-Wing. [[/footnote]]

The containment chamber must be inspected daily for signs of wear or damage by a team of no less than 5 D-Class personnel. Before inspection, psychological personnel assigned to the entity are to evaluate 7575-B via remote radio transmission to ensure that the entity is calm and that the entity is aware of said D-Class personnel coming within its red zone. 7575-B must audibly consent to the movement of D-Class personnel within 16 meters of itself before inspection may resume.

This primary chamber is sealed within a thin layer of electromagnetically charged lead. Artificially generated Iravani waves[[footnote]] Dense metaphysical clusters of cognitive wavelengths replicated within a given noösphere. Named for the late Prof. Mohammed Al-Iravani.[[/footnote]] originating from 7575-A may be intercepted by this electrical current, effectively dampening 7575-B&#39;s capability to generate Class-C Wormholes beyond 16 meters of itself. Hume discordance within SCP-7575&#39;s red zone, as well as within the chamber itself, are to be recorded at all times by various on-site Kant counters; high discordance rates[[footnote]] Exceeding at least 157.40 Hm. [[/footnote]] may suggest pronounced atomic regression into 7575-Omega. Should the aforementioned conditions be met, a state of emergency is to be declared regarding SCP-7575&#39;s containment, and all personnel are to be evacuated. Authorized psychologists are to contact 7575-B via radio transmission and attempt to calm the entity; it is at this point that the utilization of //Toy Story// transmission is highly recommended. 

Various children&#39;s movies are to be transmitted directly to 7575-A at the entity&#39;s request. Movies are to be transmitted at frequencies not exceeding 2-2.5 GHz at the risk of agitating 7575-B. Should 7575-B show signs of emotional distress, it is recommended that the entity be allowed to watch the movie //Toy Story (1995),// of which it has shown a distinct fondness for. It is strongly advised that the films //Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010), Charlotte&#39;s Web (1973),// and //Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)// are not be screened to 7575-A, as certain content within these movies have proved too disturbing for the entity. A list of movies approved by the SCP-7575 research and containment team can be found in Document 7575-37-B.

//Note: I&#39;d like to remind anyone assigned with speaking to SCP-7575-B that short, friendly sentences are optimal. Make no sudden loud noises. Before beginning a new sentence, always shut off the mic and consult the surrounding personnel. There&#39;s a reason you&#39;ll never be the only one at the microphone. -Dr. Rhodes//

[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7575/MRI.png|caption=Ultrasound image of SCP-7575-B]]

**Description:** Moved to Site-16 in 2017. SCP-7575 collectively designates components SCP-7575-A, -B, and -Omega respectively.

SCP-7575-A is the bio-mechanical vessel housing SCP-7575-B. It is composed of multiple different technological components, mainly a heavily modified IBM System z9 mainframe computer terminal. The object hovers 1.23 inches off of the ground at all times and is capable of movement via guided levitation. Note that 7575-A is incapable of guided ascension past 1.2 inches off of the ground, however, it is capable of scaling flat vertical surfaces. 7575-A experiences difficulty navigating unstable, uneven, or otherwise sloped surfaces, especially at steeper inclines. A Dell Professional P2017H 19.5-inch monitor is built into 7575-A&#39;s cabinet, and constantly displays a vertically scrolling feed of what appear to be multiple x-ray radiographs of malformed human faces.

The lower abdominal compartment, or &#34;abdomen,&#34; of SCP-7575-A is bloated and is coated in various mismatched electrical wires and steel plating. Minor [REDACTED] devices are installed under these plates, which serve the sole purpose of nurturing and preserving a uterus suitable for sheltering SCP-7575-B.

SCP-7575-B is a human fetus demonstrating multiple signs of contradictory stages of development: although the entity displays most traits of a third-trimester fetus, the eyes and large sections of the brain appear to be fully developed. 7575-B is sentient and sapient, capable of basic adolescent reasoning, experiencing basic emotions, and verbal communication via the speaker installed with 7575-A&#39;s aforementioned Dell Professional monitor. The umbilical cord runs through the length of 7575-A and terminates at the [REDACTED] hard drive, the speculated source of a microscopic Class-A &#34;Sustained Entry&#34; Wormhole leading to SCP-7575-Omega. 7575-B is the central control point for SCP-7575-A and -Omega, acting as a sort of &#34;brain&#34; for both instances.

7575-B&#39;s intelligence matches that of a 6-7-year-old human child. The entity is open to communication with personnel, often reacting positively to any interactions had. 7575-B is known to experience infrequent night terrors involving &#34;secret spies&#34; where it may act irrationally. An indefinite psychoactive therapy program has been enacted in order to combat these nightmares. When prompted, 7575-B believes itself to be a human being.

SCP-7575-Omega is an unstable pocket dimension maintained directly by SCP-7575-B. A permanent point of entry is located within SCP-7575-A, though the entity is capable of generating Class-C &#34;Broken Entry&#34; Wormholes at any given location should it desire. 7575-Omega&#39;s pocket universe consists of 2 main celestial objects:
* A massive, luminescent heart, giving off light at 90 lumens and over 600,000 km in radius. The beating of this heart is extremely loud, with the sound being recorded at over 2,000 decibels. No heat is generated.

* A biological planetoid approximately the same size and density as the planet Earth. Orbits around the heart at the same rate as Earth relative to the Sun. The planet&#39;s surface is composed entirely of carbon-based organic material. The atmosphere is thin (6.283 millibars), and composed of oxygen, methane, and hydrogen sulfide.

No other celestial objects have been recorded. The empty space composing the remainder of 7575-Omega is not presently known to terminate at any sort of firmament, and is entirely dark, bearing no stars or prominent cosmic formations.

Inhabiting the surface of SCP-7575-Omega&#39;s planet are all known species within the biological kingdom //Animalia,// including humans. When cross-referenced with Earth, all organisms native to 7575-Omega appear to be direct genetic clones of their Terran counterparts. Behavior and health conditions displayed on Earth are crudely replicated within SCP-7575-Omega to varying degrees of accuracy. Furthermore, variable physical features on Earth such as fault lines, plant life, buildings, etc. are replicated by the SCP-7575-Omega planet&#39;s organic surface material. //Note: Investigations as to a possible connection with [[[SCP-002]]] are underway.//

Due to 7575-Omega&#39;s existence, as well as data generated by testing, it is strongly implied that SCP-7575 possesses a certain degree of omniscience. 7575-B explains 7575-Omega as being its &#34;Lego bricks,&#34; and, when prompted, describes the act of replicating anomalous phenomena as &#34;painful,&#34; or as &#34;tummy aches.&#34; 

Though SCP-7575 is nominally passive towards humans, it is known to react suddenly at any perceived threat, forming Class-C Wormholes leading to SCP-7575-Omega as a form of self-defense. Offending subjects translocated to 7575-Omega often die of onset hemorrhaging of the epidermis and major arteries, asphyxiation, and in rarer cases, physical assault and consumption by 7575-Omega-native organisms. SCP-7575-B reacts extremely negatively towards sudden loud noises and certain comments towards its appearance or 7575-Omega that could be perceived as negative. The entity is additionally disturbed by topics such as death, memory loss, abduction, and loss of maternal figures, as well as media depicting secret agents, spies, characters dressed entirely in dark clothes, or military personnel. Coupled with this, 7575-B exhibits common signs of onset PTSD.

SCP-7575 was discovered on August 8th, 2017 when the entity spontaneously manifested within [[[SCP-914]]]&#39;s &#34;Output&#34; booth; at the time there was no ongoing testing regarding SCP-914, and the machine had not been operated for a period of 14 days up to SCP-7575&#39;s manifestation. Three personnel[[footnote]] Dr. Abernathy, Researcher H. Yules, Junior Researcher W. Burnett[[/footnote]] were stationed within research cell 109-B at the time, conducting minor calculations regarding a previous experiment. All three reported hearing a loud banging within SCP-914 before its doors opened, revealing SCP-7575, at which point all personnel evacuated from the area. The doors to research cell 109-B were shut behind them and locked as SCP-7575 proceeded into the room. Personnel also report what appeared to be a continuous noise resembling infantile crying emanating from 7575-A.

Approximately 37 minutes after initial manifestation, 3 members of the Site-85 Internal Defense Force opened the doors to research cell 109-B and attempted to sedate the entity, whereupon Agent Kirk was transposed to SCP-7575-Omega. The remaining two operatives opened fire on 7575-A before being translocated themselves. Upon inspection, no damage from the resulting gunfire has been observed on 7575-A.

&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** How did you sleep last night?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** [unresponsive]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Are you there? Tommy?[[footnote]] SCP-7575-B&#39;s preferred name. [[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** No.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Sorry?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** I didn&#39;t sleep.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Oh, I&#39;m so sorry. Why didn&#39;t you get any sleep?
&gt; 
&gt; [SCP-7575-B is unresponsive. SCP-7575-A rotates left to right, for 1.4 seconds, as if shaking its head.]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** I had a, a nightmare-- a nightmares.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Nightmares?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** Mm-hmm. Yeah.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Oh no. That&#39;s awful, Tommy.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** And I was very scared.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Well, how do you feel now? Do you need your toys?[[footnote]] Various approved toys are sometimes inserted within SCP-7575&#39;s containment at its request. [[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** No! [giggling] It&#39;s okay!
&gt; 
&gt; [Dr. Rhodes and additional containment personnel laugh with SCP-7575-B]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Aw. Well, they&#39;re here if you want them, Tommy.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** I said, it&#39;s okay, Doctor Stinky Butt![[footnote]] Nickname assigned to Dr. Rhodes by SCP-7575-B. [[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** [sarcastic] Hey! That&#39;s not very nice!
&gt; 
&gt; [SCP-7575-B and Dr. Rhodes laugh]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** But the nightmares are not as scary anymore, right? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** [unresponsive]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Tommy? Do I have that right?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** No.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** [pause] I just wanted to make sure, because, Tommy, I have a very difficult question to ask you.
&gt; 
&gt; [SCP-7575-B audibly pouts]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Tommy, you know we have to ask you these sorts of questions.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** [unresponsive]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Tommy? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** Then I want Toy Story.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** You can watch any movie you want if you let me ask. We can watch //Toy Story 4// later. How&#39;s that sound?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** [elated] There&#39;s four?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Yep! Isn&#39;t that cool?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** Yay! [cheers muffle]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** [laughs] So, can I ask my question now?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** [pause, flat tone] Okay.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** [clears throat] Well, okay. Tell me, Tommy; when you play with your Legos, can you see things from the past? Like, um, can you see things that have already happened?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** [unresponsive]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Like the dinosaurs? Can you see them?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** [pause] Yeah. They&#39;re so stupid though.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** [chuckles] They are?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** Yeah. They look stupid. [pause] The Legos are bad. They make everything look bad.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** [pause] We know, Tommy.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** And everything in my Legos are bad.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Of course. But, uh-- continuing with my question, we really need to know, Tommy; did you... have a life before this? If you can understand what I mean.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** What?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** What I mean to say is, do you remember yourself before... before your current... before what you are now, per se?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** [unresponsive]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Tommy? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** [unresponsive]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** [deactivates microphone, consults containment personnel]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** Mom and Dad liked to go on vacations a lot.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Ah-- Is that so?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** Yeah. Mommy and Daddy took me in the car and we went on lots of vacations.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Where did you go?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** All over the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Mm.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** [unresponsive]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Anything else you remember?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** [pause] Mom and Dad had lots of friends from around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** I see.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** And we would go on planes and the car to go see them. I remember I, we went to China to see my uncle. I breathed there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** You breathed?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** Mm-hmm.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Sorry. What does that mean, Tommy?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** I breathed a lot.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** I still don&#39;t understand.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** Before Mom and Dad&#39;s friends put me in the box, I breathed a lot. Now I don&#39;t breathe, and I am sad that I can&#39;t breathe anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Just like your nightmares, yes? [pause] We can stop if you need to.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** No, it&#39;s okay.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Alright.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** [unresponsive]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Tommy?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** I tried to make more air with my Legos. I tried the, uh, dioxygen and nitrogen atmosphere, and uh, I tried doing organic conduits with the lungs like my old body. But when I added the oxygen compounds and more gravity, I tried breathing the new Lego air, but it was bad air. It smelled like Dad&#39;s fart breath. I don&#39;t want Daddy. So the air is bad, so I stopped breathing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** I see.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** But when I don&#39;t breathe it hurts. It hurts really bad, Doctor Nick.[[footnote]] Dr. Rhodes&#39; initial name. [[/footnote]] And-- [sniffling] 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Hold on. Calm down, Tommy. Take a sec. 
&gt; 
&gt; [pause]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Continue.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** It feels like my head... I can&#39;t breathe. I&#39;m always holding my breath, and I can&#39;t breathe, and it hurts, and the Lego air I try making always sucks, it&#39;s shit, it smells terrible, it smells like Dad&#39;s breath, and I still can&#39;t breathe, and I see their vacant eyes disconnected from their control modems and their cameras and their delta command staring blankly in the dark space where my stars should have been,[[footnote]] [CONTEXT RESTRICTED] [[/footnote]] and I feel like, like my head is...
&gt; 
&gt; [SCP-7575-B mimics explosion sounds]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** I&#39;m so sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** And... And they said, they said I was a experiment. [sic]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Did they?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** [pause] Am I a experiment to you? [sic]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** No.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** You won&#39;t experiment on me, will you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Of course not. We would never do such a thing.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** Okay. [pause, sniffling] Can we please stop?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Of course we can. You did a great job today, Tommy. You&#39;re very strong, you know that?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** [unresponsive]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Would you like to watch //Toy Story 4// with us?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** Yeah.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Great. Just give us a few minutes to set it up. Thank you, Tommy.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7575-B:** Thanks, Doctor Nick. I love you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** We love you too.
&gt;

//Note: Since SCP-7575 has been permanently relocated to Site-16, specialists from the Department of Public Surveillance have shown interest in the entity&#39;s omniscient properties. They have already made contact, and seem to have easily come through to -B. Agents have been able to form a sort of agreement with -B that we&#39;ll let it watch extra movies if it lets us study its tummy aches. Though getting it to recall its &#34;nightmares&#34; has been increasingly difficult, with our training, we believe we can come through to the entity. -Site Director Brendon Sahlstein//
