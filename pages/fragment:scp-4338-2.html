**Description:** ##grey|SCP-4338 is a sapient, levitating,## ##blue|4.6km^^3^^## ##grey|sphere of volcanic rock inhabiting the magma chamber beneath Moaha Island. Multiple artifacts and oral traditions reference this entity as &#34;Ōsobiue&#34;, &#34;Irn&#39;acha&#34;, or &#34;God of the Burning Ocean&#34;: a central figure in the creation myths -- and extinction events -- of some 19 early oceanic cultures.##

&gt; **Foreword:** Over the last 8 months, SCP-4338&#39;s requests have become progressively more extravagant, and their behavior more erratic. While speaking, Rowell / 4338 spit molten elements in all directions, necessitating a high-tensile Plexiglas divider, routinely replaced. Rocky growths across the epidermis have increased by 230%.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewed:** Rowell / 4338
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Director Amelia Thornborrow
&gt;
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** You asked to see me, 4338?
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** INSECT! DO YOU STILL NOT KNOW HOW TO SPEAK TO YOUR OWN GOD!?
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** ... //Greetings//, oh 4 3 3 8. Your servant is honored to be called.
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** THAT IS BETTER. I HAVE NEW DEMANDS.
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** ,,shocker,, I mean, your servant is honored to listen.
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** YOU WILL DELIVER UNTO ME THE RIBS OF YOUR GREAT DAIRY BEAST, TWICE IN NUMBER THAN LAST YOU OFFERED.
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** Your ser-
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** AND MORE OF THE SOUR BAUBLES, COVERED IN SWEET DUST.
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** Your serva-
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** AND THE YELLOW SPONGES FILLED WITH CREAM! MORE OF THOSE!
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** ...
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** ...
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** Your servant. I will go-
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** AND FIVE-FOLD THE DELICATE CADBURY, SWIRLING AND STUFFED WITH AMBER-
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** Wait no, no we discussed this; those were imported chocolates from very far away. Remember, we agreed a lower quantity of higher quality food could ease the strain of our current shipping --
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** ENOUGH! YOUR &#34;STRAIN&#34; DOES NOT CONCERN ME. YOU WILL DO AS I COMMAND, OR YOU AND YOUR S C P WILL BURN!
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** Look just-- you can&#39;t spring this on us three days before--
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** CAN&#39;T? **CAN&#39;T!?** YOU WOULD DARE TELL ME WHAT I CAN OR CAN NOT DO!? YOUR DEFIANCE WEARIES ME, AM EEL YA; I WILL SUFFER IT NO LONGER!

------

**DN-4338-42:** A 4.0 earthquake was recorded on Moaha Island. All personnel were evacuated to surrounding ships, moving away at high speed. As per protocol, Director Thornborrow remained on-site.

SCP-4338 did not emerge after 45 minutes. Quakes became periodic rather than steady, occurring in small, violent jolts. Drone craft were dispatched to take low-pass video, revealing SCP-4338 repeatedly failing to exit the crater lip; unlike six months prior, it now lacked the appropriate speed and dimensions.

Security Cruiser //Kingfisher// returned to the island shortly after, allowing Director Thornborrow to continue the interview.

------
 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** 4338, your servant would ask why you didn&#39;t- er, &#34;execute&#34; your threat.
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** ...YOU AMUSE ME.
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** Pardon?
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** YOU AMUSE ME, AM EEL YA. BY MY MERCY, YOUR LIFE MAY DWINDLE ON; BUT NEVER QUESTION ME AGAIN, OR YOU SHALL KNOW ONLY TORMENT AND DEATH!
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** ... Well then, your servant is honored. Shall we continue?
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** YES. I DEMAND THE CADBURY-
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** Actually, I was thinking now would be a good time to discuss a full overhaul of our current arrangement.
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** WHAT!?
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** A good 30% total reduction, along with a substitution of--
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** FILTH! DO YOU YEARN FOR DEATH SO DESPERATELY!?
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** --duced personnel and security, given only one person really needs --
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** ENOUGH! ENOUGH! **ENOUGH**!

------

**DN-4338-43:** Another earthquake was detected, now only 2.8. Security personnel present during the interview moved to evacuate, but Director Thornborrow signaled them to stop. SCP-4338 again failed to exit the crater. Versus previous events, only 5% of the molten rock was expelled.

------

&gt; //Predictably, during DN-4338-43, Rowell/4338 was observed shouting, spitting, and wrenching against their restraints. This behavior lasted for 8 minutes, until Rowell/4338 became fatigued, and slumped over onto the floor.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** ... Is that all?
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** WRETCH. YOU WOULD EVOKE MY ANGER YET A-
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** Your servant has no wish to anger you, 4338. If you are displeased, then I and my people shall leave--
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** NO!
&gt; 
&gt; //Rowell / 4338 sits bolt upright, attempting to pull themselves up by the table&#39;s edge, but only managing to stumble forward.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** NO! YOU CANNOT! YOU-- I DEMAND YOU... I... I demand...
&gt; 
&gt; //Rowell / 4338 slowly lowers itself back down to the floor//
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** ... Are you ready to continue, 4338?
&gt; 
&gt; //Rowell / 4338 remain prone and silent for 8 seconds, then speak into their folded arms.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Rowell / 4338:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Thornborrow:** Good. Now, about this overhaul?
