**Item #:** SCP-2393

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2393-1 is to be contained in a standard biological containment greenhouse at Site-103. A data storage and interface device compatible with a USB A-port and designated for the purpose of interacting with SCP-2393-1 is to be kept within reasonable access of researchers in SCP-2393&#39;s containment. SCP-2393-1 is to be regularly checked for new and updated instances of SCP-2393-2. All instances of SCP-2393-2 are to be stored both on the designated device and on off-site digital storage. For the purpose of monitoring SCP-2393-3, all security cameras in SCP-2393&#39;s greenhouse are to run SCP-2393-2-B.

**Description:** SCP-2393-1 is a specimen of //Juniperus occidentalis australis// (Sierra Juniper). Embedded in SCP-2393-1&#39;s trunk appears to be a standard USB A-port. When a device compatible with this type of port is connected to SCP-2393-1, the device will treat SCP-2393-1 as a file storage device.

Some, but not all, files and software originating from SCP-2393-1 (designated SCP-2393-2) demonstrate anomalous properties. The contents of SCP-2393-2 seems to update at random intervals. Files and software can be viewed, opened, copied, or uploaded. All SCP-2393-2 instances utilize an unknown alphabet, language[[footnote]]Language and alphabet appear to have Ancient Greek roots. Translation efforts are ongoing.[[/footnote]], and coding language.

SCP-2393-2-B is an instance of SCP-2393-2 designed to run as an imaging and video application. SCP-2393-2-B is currently the only means of observing SCP-2393-3; no other digital or analog recording measures have recorded it to date.
    
SCP-2393-3 is an incorporeal humanoid entity visually similar to an adolescent human female, with the exception of a light green hue in the entity&#39;s epidermal and keratinous tissues. SCP-2393-3 has not yet been observed at a distance greater than 10 meters away from SCP-2393-1. SCP-2393-3 has been observed conducting the following activities:
* listening to music on what appears to be a portable music player
* using what appears to be a personal computer
* using what appears to be a cellular device
* dancing
* sleeping
Entity appears to be capable of observing humans without outside assistance. Through the use of SCP-2393-2-B, Foundation linguists have been working with SCP-2393-3 both to understand its language and to help it learn modern Greek. In the short-term, communication has been accomplished through the use of hand gestures, facial expressions, pictures, and onomatopoeia. SCP-2393-3 is generally well-tempered and friendly towards Foundation staff.

**Addendum 1:** Over the course of SCP-2393&#39;s containment, the Foundation has been able to copy SCP-2393-2 freely. The following is an abridged list of SCP-2393-2 files discovered and copied. For a full list of SCP-2393-2 instances and full numerical identifications, please refer to document 2393-Epsilon.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Abridged list of SCP-2393-2&#34; hide=&#34;- For a full list, please consult document 2393-Epsilon&#34;]]

All instances referred to by shorthand code names designated by on-site staff for ease of reference.

* &#34;Text&#34;:
A text program. Program is functionally similar to the program ████ from the company █████████. Spelling, grammar, and definitions provided by the program are currently being used to translate SCP-2393-3&#39;s language. Documents created by SCP-2393-3 using SCP-2393-2-1 are currently believed to be composed mainly of poetry and literary analysis. No anomalous effects detected.

* &#34;Tree Wars&#34;:
A 3D multiplayer strategy game. The player is represented by a tree or shrub of varying type. The player is able to command wildlife in order to block other players&#39; wildlife or to collect food and resources, such as nuts and berries, off of other players&#39; avatars. These resources can be used to &#34;purchase&#34; more wildlife units. A player is defeated if they have no resources left. All attempts to block the file&#39;s connection to other users have been ineffective. No further anomalous effects detected.

* &#34;Robin&#34;:
An anomalous program. Consists of a grey background with a toggle, slider, and two buttons overlaid onto it. When one button (labeled create/start/launch(?)) is pressed, an instance of //Turdus migratorius// (American Robin) will materialize on a surface within 1 meter of the user. Sex of the robin is determined by the toggle. The age is determined by the slider, with the age ranging from a freshly laid egg to a robin approximately 6 years of age. When the second button (labeled delete/stop(?)) is clicked, a robin created by the application will dematerialize.

* &#34;Chatleaf&#34;:
A messaging, networking, and social media program.  Calculated number of users currently stands at █████. User avatars consist mostly of images of plant life and entities resembling SCP-2393-3. All attempts to block the file&#39;s connection to other users have been ineffective. No further anomalous effects detected.

* &#34;Brancher&#34;:
Unknown. Program displays visual characteristics of a web browser. All attempts to use the software have resulted in an unknown error message coming from the program. No anomalous effects detected.

* &#34;Tunes&#34;:
A musical playlist consisting of 15 files. Music is similar to the pop and electronic music genres. Lyrics are sung in the same language spoken by SCP-2393-3. Music is composed of bird calls, the sounds of wind and water, and other natural sounds. No anomalous effects detected.

In addition to copying SCP-2393-2 instances, researchers have been able to upload files to the collection of SCP-2393-2 in SCP-2393-1. SCP-2393-3 is able to view these files, making this a possible route of limited communication. Uploading files to SCP-2393-1 requires permission from the current Head of Containment or Head of Research for SCP-2393, or permission from the current Site-66 Director.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Abridged list of files uploaded to SCP-2393-1&#34; hide=&#34;- For a full list, please consult document 2393-Epsilon&#34;]]

* forestsofnorthamerica.pdf:
PDF format of a book containing illustrations and descriptions of several North American forests and trees. Subject reacted with enthusiasm to the file.

* █████2393.jpg:
Image taken using SCP-2393-2-B. Contents consists of SCP-2393-3 and Junior Researcher █████, both smiling. Subject expressed happiness both when viewing the image, and when next exposed to Junior Researcher █████.

* juniper.jpg:
Image of a specimen of //Juniperus occidentalis australis//. Subject displayed both recognition of and distaste towards the image.

* trees.doc
Text document form of &#34;Trees&#34; by Joyce Kilmer. Subject displayed confusion at the meaning of the poem, but showed recognition of and appreciation for every instance of the word &#34;tree&#34; in the poem.

**Addendum 2:** The following is a partial list of translated vocalizations produced by SCP-2393-3. A brief piece of context is provided before each log.

&gt; //SCP-2393-3 has just lost a match in &#34;Tree Wars.&#34;// / SCP-2393-3: &#34;No! You [amateur/newcomer/novice?]! We could have won that round! Don&#39;t move your [birds?] in front of my squirrels.&#34;

&gt; //SCP-2393-3 is listening to music files on its portable music player.// / SCP-2393-3:
&gt; &#34;♫On the days that the rain is falling♫
&gt; ♫I call a toast to the sun.♫
&gt; ♫On the days that the sun is shining♫
&gt; ♫I feast and sing to the air.♫
&gt; ♫And I won&#39;t let anyone fell me,♫
&gt; ♫No I&#39;ll do things my own way.♫&#34;

&gt; //SCP-2393-3 is communicating with an unknown outside source using &#34;Chatleaf.&#34;// / &#34;No, I&#39;m not going back.&#34; ... &#34;You know what they do to us if we&#39;re caught, I&#39;m safe here.&#34; ... &#34;I don&#39;t care about my roots anymore, they were severed a long time ago.&#34; ... &#34;Look, we all decided that man&#39;s magic was not bad, that is why we use it. I am merely standing for what I know to be true.&#34;

&gt; //SCP-2393-3 is reclining against SCP-2393-1.// / SCP-2393-3: &#34;It&#39;s a good thing the people here are so kind. They are not afraid of my magic because they share it. They give me such nice gifts. They don&#39;t burn anyone either.&#34;
