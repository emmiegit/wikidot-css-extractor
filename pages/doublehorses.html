Dr. Jacobs stood at the head of the boardroom, advancing through a slideshow as he gave his presentation. Projected on the screen was a photograph of a somewhat ill-maintained livery stable bordered by a chain-link fence. A horse stood off to the side, gazing at the camera.

&#34;One thing to keep in mind before entering the house of inconstant horses is these horses simply can&#39;t be relied upon,&#34; he said. &#34;They are very untrustworthy, even though they may not seem it.&#34;

//Click.// The slide changed to a tilted photograph of one of the stables inside. Daylight shone from an opened door behind the camera, partially washing out the scene. A horse stood at the darkened far end, away from the photographer, its throat bulging.

He continued narrating. &#34;Also, during periods of high stress, their necks are known to swell threateningly and exude intoxicating odors.&#34;

//Click.// A D-class was shown eagerly following a horse away from several members of a field team, all of whom were wearing gas masks. The D-class was not. The agents were going after the D-class, whose gait suggested extreme speed.

&#34;Men have been led to their doom by the swollen necks of terrified horses.&#34;

//Click.// An aerial photo, most likely from a helicopter, of three D-classes chasing the swollen horse and eight agents chasing the D-classes into a mile-wide, sprawling, gnarled thicket of thorny branches and prickly hedges.

Dr. Jacobs described the picture. &#34;Men led to the center of a deadly maze by bored horses who are also rude.&#34;

//Click.// A rotting human corpse wearing a D-class uniform being found in a clearing in the thicket by the field team. The timestamp showed that only half an hour had passed.

&#34;Horse-pranked fools slowly starving to death in the center of a large, complicated bush.&#34;

//Click.// The slideshow came to an end. Dr. Jacobs switched off the projector. The overhead fluorescent lights came back on.

&#34;So it&#39;s best to keep these things in mind and also probably other things. It sometimes seems there is no end to the things required to keep in one&#39;s mind, but I recommend limiting the things you bring with you into the house of inconstant horses, as a busy mind is upsetting to the horses.&#34;

Dr. Jacobs smiled at his audience, a group of several other researchers sitting around a table. No one spoke for a time until a man near the front coughed.

&#34;I am entranced by the world you inhabit,&#34; said Dr. Adelie, clearing his throat.

Dr. Jacobs blushed. &#34;Thanks.&#34;

&#34;I will find the house. I will conquer it. I will whip these horses into shape, goddammit,&#34; exclaimed Dr. Taylor, on the warpath as usual.

Every swiveling chair turned as the door to the meeting room opened. A black-haired woman stuck her head inside. &#34;I heard the word &#34;horses.&#34; I like that.&#34;

&#34;Hi Dr. Hanawalt!&#34; Dr. Jacobs yelled awkwardly. He stuck out his hand, holding a fancy slip of paper. &#34;Here is an invitation to play my game &#34;DOUBLEHORSE.&#34; It&#39;s where you draw what you think a doublehorse is. It&#39;s fun!&#34;

Dr. Hanawalt hissed through her teeth. &#34;Oh dude, I&#39;m working right now...&#34; She thought for a second. &#34;But I might have an hour free to play DOUBLEHORSE tonight!&#34;

&#34;Hell yeah, a genuine Hanawalt doublehorse would be amazing!&#34;

&#34;I appreciate the invite,&#34; she said. &#34;Most people are too intimidated to play DOUBLEHORSE against me...

In his awkwardness, Dr. Jacobs let his thoughts drift. &#34;I accidentally just pictured Dr. Lockwood a doublehorse into battle.&#34;

Trying to be reassuring, Dr. Hanawalt shushed him. &#34;That was no accident! She&#39;s riding the main horse and I&#39;m in the little attached sidecar horse.&#34;

Dr. Kelly, who up until this point had been silent, now spoke up. &#34;When I visited the house of inconstant horses, I tried to sneak a horse stability expert in with me, but the foothills did this little escalator trick and carried her away...&#34;

&#34;I feel ashamed of my doublehorse,&#34; sighed Dr. Walters. &#34;He can&#39;t even run. The doublehorse Dr. Taylor described could do some kind of little sideways sashay but mine, ugh...&#34;

Dr. Sterrestof, the resident xenobiologist, then spoke. &#34;I&#39;ve only seen alien doublehorses ... they&#39;re extremely sweet yet notoriously unreliable. And they come in all shades of pinkish purple.&#34;

The room was silent. She went on, her greener eye looking around independently.

&#34;Oh, and contrary to the Earth doublehorses, they&#39;re always into french kissing.&#34;

There was still silence.

&#34;With each other, I might add.&#34;

Dr. Adelie cleared his throat again. He seemed to be coming down with something. Dr. Kelly patted him on the back.

&#34;If you double a horse&#39;s Pok√©dex number, which is 472,&#34; Dr. Nate Tarrant, the mathematician, remarked as he discreetly typed into a calculator, &#34;you get UNDEFINED, which is made up of a bunch of cough SFX and mountain sprites. Speed-runners use it to bypass time-consuming areas like [BIRTH] and [DIRECTIONLESS LONGING].&#34;

Suddenly, Dr. Jacobs struck the table with a fist, remembering something he had forgotten. He turned the projector back on. The lights darkened and he called up a final slide. On the screen, an ancient Greek philosopher was sketching a strange, indistinct animal amidst geometric formulae.

&#34;This is Euclid logically deriving a doublehorse from a simple, made-at-home axiom that anyone can use!&#34; Everyone oohed and ahhed in acknowledgement. There were a few more slides of Euclid&#39;s tablet at increasing magnification; Dr. Jacobs advanced past them until the slideshow was over.

The lights came back on. Inexplicably, Dr. Tarrant stayed dark, as well as a shadowy copy of him lurking in the corner of the room. 

&#34;BOTH DARK NATES HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT DOUBLEHORSE,&#34; Dr. Jacobs screeched. The shadowy figure flickered out. Dr. Tarrant stayed dark.</textarea></pre>
