This is a series showing off news from the site, articles from the past month[[footnote]] with a rating above 0 [[/footnote]], and fan-content for you to check out and discover! Be sure to leave a comment with your thoughts!

++++ Featured Articles

* The featured articles for December were [[[SCP-2858]]] (&#34;As Though The Wasps Themselves Had Worked It There&#34;) by Taffeta, [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/six-letters-addressed |Six Letters Addressed to the SCP Foundation (and One Letter Home)]]] by ahbonjour, and [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/broken-mind |The Broken Mind]]] by fortunefavorsbold.

Check them out!

++++ Editor&#39;s Choice Articles

* [[[SCP-3084]]] (&#34;Seven Strangers at a Feast&#34;) - A film takes on a life of its own. Written by Kalinin. //Seven Strangers is a fantastically eerie piece, operating on a surreal internal logic and meshing together a collection of classic horror elements in a uniquely Foundation style. Seven Strangers gave me goosebumps and is not to be missed.//
* [[[SCP-049-J]]] (&#34;The Plague Fellow&#34;) - Gotta get that sweet medieval bitcoin. Written by djkaktus. //This is the only good article about 049. It&#39;s a terrific riff on the (in)famous doctor and is wickedly funny in its own right. This author gives it two severed thumbs up!//

* [[[An Old Woman and her Garden]]] - A fairy tale about a sweet old lady and her garden of undead horrors. Written by fieldstone. //An Old Woman&#39;s unique protagonist and Tim Burton-esque gothic fantasy mesh together to form one of the best creepypastas I&#39;ve read in recent memory.//

Thanks for tuning in again, folks! If you&#39;re unsatisfied with the blurb(s) provided for the article(s) you wrote, feel free to change it. Of course, you could just avoid that problem entirely by sending A Random Day a blurb for your article. We may or may not use it (if we can think of something more attention-getting, though we can try to stick with one you give us) but we&#39;d really would just like them in order to make the process easier for making these. This is a community thing, and we want authors to give their blurbs to sell these articles much easier. It reduces the workload we have to do, and helps the news come out that much earlier!
