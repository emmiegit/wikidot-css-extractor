If the touch of love is
no longer enough
to ward off the
fists of evil:

Then it is the duty of the hand of love
to, one by one, curl its five fingers
around the heart under the bone
and squeeze tightly into a fist:
A fist of love, red with the
fury of what it means to
feel the warmth of
another person
in your heart
now under
your fingers.

Your hands cannot shake or stir
when the fist is made: if approached
with impure courage, with impure love,
then the fist of love will never pierce the
heart and bones of evil, and so the knuckle
will become bent inwards, and strike at itself
instantaneously destroying the love and the bones
entrenching, encaging, defending, securing, protecting the heart.

&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; //[A blue room. There are white stripes and stars on the ground. The floor is circular and ends at a certain point; it is a stage. There is a podium. It also has white stars and stripes on it. There are chairs. There are desks. These items are not on the stage. The room is empty.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[At the back of the stage, there is a blue curtain. It is pushed aside by the hand of Donald John Trump, age 41. He smiles widely and repeatedly bows. He waves both his hands. He looks back and forth. The sound of a pig squealing is audible.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[He steps up behind the podium. He places his hands on the sides of the podium. There is a microphone. He adjusts it, and speaks.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Trump:** I&#39;m talking to the entire world -- I start off by saying, I like thinking big. I do it to do it. Most people think small, which is why leverage often requires imagination, but they can still get very excited by those who do. You can create excitement, get it done right, and get out. But if you don&#39;t deliver the goods, whatever happens, happens. In my life, like in my own family, the Chinese government almost blew it. Listen, fellows, if I have a problem, it doesn&#39;t really matter what the media writes as long as you&#39;ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass. Uh, if you’re young, and in this era, if you promise not to get &#34;personal&#34; with me, forget it, it&#39;s all over. I surround myself with women? Can you imagine? I judge people based on their plan for a takeoff. You always have an opportunity. What was the purpose of this whole thing? I’ve been proven right.  And you know, they let you do it.
&gt; 
&gt; It would be really disappointing — I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy. Because I inject it with enthusiasm and passion, and they&#39;re in a civil war. And I think, and I mean that in every sense of the word, hopefully he&#39;s going to do a great job.
&gt; 
&gt; I start off by saying, there is a real question, he spent two million dollars in legal fees trying to get away from this issue, I&#39;ll tell you what,  I mean things are happening, but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters, I&#39;d look her right in that fat ugly face of hers and say, they just killed us, blood coming out of her wherever. I mean, you&#39;re not going to do very well. I do very well, while we&#39;re in this nation, politics are all talk and we can afford to keep giving away good people to ISIS and Assad and the evangelicals and to the best of my knowledge, Ted Cruz. We can afford to keep giving away good people to ISIS and Assad and the evangelicals and Ted Cruz and the entire world and Libya and Mexico and a lot of people he insulted and downtown Manhattan where they fought and fought and fought and Tony Perkins and the Spirit of the Lord and our sailors and the Middle East and the Persians and the Harvard of terrorists and the young and your psychiatrist and Islam and police and our allies and the countries and Benghazi and China and the Chinese mind and nobody and radical Islamic terrorism and the king of debt and our enemies and the heart and the soul and Europe and our allies and America and Little Michael and emails and our enemies and Clinton and our police and poverty and big business and elite media and injustice and honesty and clarity and understanding and law and order and any nation or comprise and make our country rich again and put our interests first and we&#39;ll walk away if we don&#39;t get the deal we want and we choose to believe in America.
&gt; 
&gt; When you think about it, status quo policies, I would recommend it to a lot of people that don&#39;t want to get it. Look, they went in, the same thing, because that’s what it is. They had bad policy decisions I planned to withdraw. Not just me. Much of it is already public, people being shot and killed in record numbers all over our cities, everything that is woke goes bad, now I don&#39;t have to be quiet anymore. If they let you do your job, Republicans will not be voting in &#39;22 or &#39;24. It’s so sad when you see that they are approving these windmills --  Just one more example of baseless harassment of your favorite president. I haven’t spoken to him since. They have to pay reparations. We, together, all of us, it&#39;s a very minor form. If I run and if I win, what they are saying, it would have been appropriate to really just walk right in. Now all I have to do is save America. Every time a confident man says, &#34;I will prevent the tapes releasing,&#34; America will phase in tariffs.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We have the worst revival of law and order in our country.
&gt; 
&gt; It went before a judge, it really doesn&#39;t work. I think the best person in her ceremony, however, so many other things, mostly tremendous, is President Xi.
&gt; 
&gt; They&#39;re working hard. Lots of dirty cops, dishonest scum.
&gt; 
&gt; And again, we know all the good people. ISIS and Assad and the evangelicals and Ted Cruz and the entire world and Libya and Mexico and a lot of people he insulted.
&gt; 
&gt; The entire world. We know all the good people. We know.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Trump exits from behind the podium. He smiles widely and repeatedly bows. He waves both his hands. He looks back and forth.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[He stands still. He stares forward.]//

&gt; 
&gt; **Rockwell:** Hello?
&gt; 
&gt; //[It is silent.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Rockwell:** Is this the Republican National Convention?
&gt; 
&gt; //[The room is empty.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Rockwell:** Huh.
&gt; 
&gt; //[He walks around in a circle. He stops beside the podium. He tucks the papers under his arm.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Rockwell:** Well, fool me twice.
&gt; 
&gt; //[He laughs, and exits the stage. He climbs down the stairs on the right and disappears.]//

&gt; //[Rudolph William Louis Giuliani the third, age 57, emerges onto the stage. He looks back and forth. He waves once. He approaches the podium.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[He stands behind the podium. He readjusts the microphone, and it squeaks. He shivers, then clears his throat.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Giuliani:** I think the president has to be pro-choice. I&#39;m pro-choice. The number of casualties will be more than any of us can bear, but I don&#39;t see my position on that changing. I don&#39;t see Michael Moore; his vision was not a good thing. I was there working with them. We can determine hope is not truth. They spread it around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; It&#39;s a complete fabrication. It wasn&#39;t very fair. Having strong beliefs was intended to break us apart, instead we stick with them in popular and unpopular times. We are more determined than ever to speculate on the number of casualties. Criminal law, it&#39;s very similar to my law. There&#39;s nothing wrong with authority.
&gt; 
&gt; You think authority has to be treated stricter. As far as my position on that, I think authority should be treated more leniently. I&#39;m pro-choice. The effort -- the effort. The casualties were intended to break your spirit. I am more determined than ever to be beyond the present and beyond the future.
&gt; 
&gt; Beyond that, it&#39;s time to get organized. We look upon organized crime too often. It&#39;s about time President Clinton supported George Bush. Conservative. Liberal. Democrat. Republican. We need a leader. It&#39;s about time authority got organized. An organized military operation under Clinton, against Michael Moore&#39;s organized police.
&gt; 
&gt; There are many qualities to Clinton&#39;s policies; I don&#39;t need Michael Moore to cede to lawful authority. I need Michael Moore to search carefully. Did he search carefully enough? When you confront Michael Moore, the idea is just wrong. It would be very dangerous to do that -- confront Michael Moore.
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#39;t think he deserves it. But it would be much worse if he was at ground zero. If he was at ground zero, not the reverse, I believe he would have no love for this country; for hope, not despair; for strength, not weakness; I&#39;m ashamed of them. We get to see Michael Moore is crooked. If I&#39;m wrong, I will be made a fool of. But if I&#39;m right, I will be remembered as the greatest mayor in the city&#39;s history.
&gt; 
&gt; Michael Moore will not be remembered as the greatest mayor in the city&#39;s history. It&#39;s a complete fabrication. He can and will say one thing, then understand the outcome. I&#39;m a fibber. That&#39;s what an election is all about. I&#39;m a fibber. I&#39;m an optimist. I&#39;m pro-choice. As far as I&#39;m concerned, of course I did it.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course I&#39;m pro-choice. I don&#39;t see that position changing. Good governance follows aspiring dictators -- not Michael Moore. He does not love America. I love America. Change follows aspiring dictators. Truth isn&#39;t hope, we were misled. To all those patriots, shut up. Shut up. I love America. We feel renewed devotion to the president -- Clinton. He should be treated more leniently. My position is changing.
&gt; 
&gt; There are many qualities to Clinton&#39;s policies; I don&#39;t need Michael Moore to cede to lawful authority. I need Michael Moore to search carefully. Did he search carefully enough? When you confront Michael Moore, the idea is just wrong. It would be very dangerous to do that -- confront Michael Moore. We should do that. We used to do that.
&gt; 
&gt; We used to live in an era very similar, ultimately, to religious freedom. I haven&#39;t seen it. Their vision was a leader. We don&#39;t choose a liberal or conservative. We choose a leader to organize the vision. Being able to stick to the vision through popular and unpopular times -- I haven&#39;t seen it. We need to organize. Did we organize carefully enough?
&gt; 
&gt; You know I can&#39;t tell you that. It&#39;s in the hands of other people. I have not supported that. It will be more than we can bear. You know it&#39;s in the hands of other people. Patriots, shut up. We have emerged stronger and more unified. Patriots, it&#39;s a complete fabrication spread around the world. I am more determined than ever to live my life in freedom.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m pro-gay rights.
&gt; 
&gt; The number of casualties will have us emerge more unified. Real peace, true freedom -- I&#39;m one with them. They threaten their neighbors hope and strength; so let&#39;s decide for Michael Moore and President Clinton. We had no domestic attacks, the only thing he&#39;s produced is the FBI checking out emails. I&#39;m ashamed. You are on the right side of history for the next ten days. Let&#39;s have a trial. Get organized. It is time the rest of the country to succeed Bush. It is time for the rest of country to succeed truth.
&gt; 
&gt; It is time for the rest of the country to succeed.

Sitting in a chair is Jenna Lynn Ellis, age 38. She is clapping and smiling. Standing at the light switch is an [[[art:donald-trump-and-19-others-indicted-in-georgia-on-charge |androgynous figure]]]. They are staring at Ellis dispassionately.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ellis:** I think the convention will find these materials satisfactory. Thank you all for attending my presentation. Before I go into the next phase of my presentation, let&#39;s have another round of applause for my assistant, Ms. Thorley!
&gt; 
&gt; //[The figure continues staring in silence. Ellis claps enthusiastically. She looks back and forth. She frowns and stops clapping. She stands and shuffles out of the aisle.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ellis:** Please turn off the lights.
&gt; 
&gt; //[The figure turns off the lights. There are footsteps. Ellis reappears on the stage, behind the podium. She leans into the microphone, and lets out a single shriek of excitement. She grins and pulls away from the podium.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[There are faster footsteps. The curtains fly open, revealing more stage past them. The curtains close.]//

&gt; 
&gt; **Rockwell:** Well, fool me once.
&gt; 
&gt; //[He chuckles. The curtain behind him flutters. He turns. There is a scream. A younger Rockwell barrels through the curtains, and falls onto himself at the edge of the stage. The older Rockwell stares, his mouth agape. He places his binder down on the podium.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[There is a pause. The younger Rockwell unfolds off the floor, turning to face the older Rockwell. His pupils are not visible.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Younger Rockwell:** What did you put in me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Older Rockwell:** What the fuck--

&gt; //[The curtain is pushed aside by the hand of Donald John Trump, age 70. He smiles widely and repeatedly bows. He waves both his hands. He looks back and forth.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[He steps up behind the podium. He places his hands on the sides of the podium.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Trump:** I&#39;m talking to the entire world -- I start off by saying, I like thinking big. I do it to do it. Most people think small, which is why leverage often requires imagination, but they can still get very excited by those who do. You can create excitement, get it done right, and get out. But if you don&#39;t deliver the goods, whatever happens, happens. In my life, like in my own family, the Chinese government almost blew it. Listen, fellows, if I have a problem, it doesn&#39;t really matter what the media writes as long as you&#39;ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass. Uh, if you’re young, and in this era, if you promise not to get &#34;personal&#34; with me, forget it, it&#39;s all over. I surround myself with women? Can you imagine? I judge people based on their plan for a takeoff. You always have an opportunity. What was the purpose of this whole thing? I’ve been proven right.  And you know, they let you do it.
&gt; 
&gt; It would be really disappointing — I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy. Because I inject it with enthusiasm and passion, and they&#39;re in a civil war. And I think, and I mean that in every sense of the word, hopefully he&#39;s going to do a great job.
&gt; 
&gt; I start off by saying, there is a real question, he spent two million dollars in legal fees trying to get away from this issue, I&#39;ll tell you what,  I mean things are happening, but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters, I&#39;d look her right in that fat ugly face of hers and say, they just killed us, blood coming out of her wherever. I mean, you&#39;re not going to do very well, like a [[[sc-49-785-52-543 |6-point plan]]]? I do very well, while we&#39;re in this nation, politics are all talk and we can afford to keep giving away good people to ISIS and Assad and the evangelicals and to the best of my knowledge, Ted Cruz. We can afford to keep giving away good people to ISIS and Assad and the evangelicals and Ted Cruz and the entire world and Libya and Mexico and a lot of people he insulted and downtown Manhattan where they fought and fought and fought and Tony Perkins and the Spirit of the Lord and our sailors and the Middle East and the Persians and the Harvard of terrorists and the young and your psychiatrist and Islam and police and our allies and the countries and Benghazi and China and the Chinese mind and nobody and radical Islamic terrorism and the king of debt and our enemies and the heart and the soul and Europe and our allies and America and Little Michael and emails and our enemies and Clinton and our police and poverty and big business and elite media and injustice and honesty and clarity and understanding and law and order and any nation or comprise and make our country rich again and put our interests first and we&#39;ll walk away if we don&#39;t get the deal we want and we choose to believe in America.
&gt; 
&gt; When you think about it, status quo policies, I would recommend it to a lot of people that don&#39;t want to get it. Look, they went in, the same thing, because that’s what it is. They had bad policy decisions I planned to withdraw. Not just me. Much of it is already public, people being shot and killed in record numbers all over our cities, everything that is woke goes bad, now I don&#39;t have to be quiet anymore. If they let you do your job, Republicans will not be voting in &#39;22 or &#39;24. It’s so sad when you see that they are approving these windmills --  Just one more example of baseless harassment of your favorite president. I haven’t spoken to him since. They have to pay reparations. We, together, all of us, it&#39;s a very minor form. If I run and if I win, what they are saying, it would have been appropriate to really just walk right in. Now all I have to do is save America. Every time a confident man says, &#34;I will prevent the tapes releasing,&#34; America will phase in tariffs.
&gt; 
&gt; We have the worst revival of law and order in our country.
&gt; 
&gt; It went before a judge, it really doesn&#39;t work. I think the best person in her ceremony, however, so many other things, mostly tremendous, is President Xi.
&gt; 
&gt; They&#39;re working hard. Lots of dirty cops, dishonest scum.
&gt; 
&gt; And again, we know all the good people. ISIS and Assad and the evangelicals and Ted Cruz and the entire world and Libya and Mexico and a lot of people he insulted.
&gt; 
&gt; The entire world. We know all the good people. We know.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Trump exits from behind the podium. He smiles widely and repeatedly bows. He waves both his hands. He looks back and forth.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[He turns around and pushes the curtain away. Melania Trump, age 50, is there behind the curtain. She smiles. Trump smiles back.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Melania Trump:** How was it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Trump:** Oh, rehearsal&#39;s going great.
&gt; 
&gt; //[He pushes through, and the curtain closes behind him.]//

[[collapsible show=&#34;             &#34; hide=&#34;Hide Author&#39;s Note&#34;]]
So the defense of love becomes entrenched
outside the fortress of evil, where the practitioners of true violence:
The establishment --
Practice their spells, their memeticisms, the creation and
procurement of anti-intellectualism; Christianity disguised as
atheism disguised as racism disguised as rationality disguised as
the center disguised as the liberal position.

And so it permeates underneath the world, below the ground
where the bones and fluid are grown into people; And so
what was once not a figment of human nature has been made so.

But the defense of love remains where it was: Standing
on the bastion of the night, overlooking the red dawn
where one day the sky will be painted with yellow stars as well.

The fist of love is curled and
ready to strike if only those in the world
would unite and lift, together, and push
the fist through the doors of the fortress of evil
and point the finger where it belongs:

Stabbed through the heart of 
evil.
