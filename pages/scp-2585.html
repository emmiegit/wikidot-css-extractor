**Item #:** SCP-2585

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the infrequency of human contact with SCP-2585, containment for the phenomenon is largely self-imposed.  The Foundation will operate through various front agencies to minimize climbing attempts of K2 during periods of SCP-2585 activity, and all deaths attributed to it are to be declared a result of avalanche or weather conditions.  Terrestrial and satellite observation of K2 is to be maintained continuously.  As the nature of SCP-2585 remains unclear, containment procedures are to be considered tentative, --however, due to the largely static behavior of the phenomenon, modification of said procedures in the foreseeable future is unlikely.--  

REVISION: ██/██/1991: Due to the results of Exploration C, and the shortage of Foundation personnel with the appropriate mountaineering experience, active explorations of K2 during periods of SCP-2585 activity are presently suspended.

REVISION ██/██/1995: During each detected SCP-2585 manifestation, one (1) Mummery-Class drone operated by a Level-2 engineer at Outpost-2585 is to ascend the mountain and confirm the presence of SCP-2585-1.  In the event that SCP-2585-1 is not detected within 48 hours of the drone clearing the 7000m mark, or SCP-2585-1 is confirmed as neutralized, one (1) D-Class personnel will be allotted to Outpost-2585 and Contingency-Mīrāth will be executed (Level 2 or higher personnel may see Document-2585-Mīrāth for details).

**Description:** SCP-2585 is a cloud known to manifest in the vicinity of K2 in Pakistan.  The cloud, upon appearing, will enshroud K2 entirely, obscuring the mountain&#39;s surface.  SCP-2585 does not visibly differ from normal cloud cover, but is detectable by the spontaneity of its onset and the unusually high atmospheric pressure within it.  Regions affected by SCP-2585 experience volatile meteorological and topographical disturbances, none of which are observable from outside the cloud cover.  SCP-2585 manifestations may occur at any time, and there is no determined pattern to these occurrences.

SCP-2585-1 is a humanoid entity which, to date, has been encountered by all individuals who attempt to climb K2 during SCP-2585 manifestations.  The entity is equipped with an Apollo/Skylab A7L spacesuit, which entirely conceals their characteristics, and is roughly 2 meters in height.  When encountered, SCP-2585-1 has been observed to travel the surface of K2 on foot as well as levitate via unknown means.  --The entity has never communicated verbally, but may have attempted to do so through body language (see exploration logs).  The motivations of SCP-2585-1 are unclear; presently it is not even known whether the entity is sentient.--  SCP-2585-1 has never been observed except by individuals inside SCP-2585&#39;s cloud cover, and has only been encountered at altitudes above 7km.

SCP-2585 was discovered by the Foundation in 1984, thirty years after the first successful ascent of K2.  Since its discovery, SCP-2585 is believed to be responsible for at least ██ of the known 80 deaths on the mountain.  During that time, a number of disappearances have been reported in the region of Karakoram surrounding K2.  These disappearances total at ██ civilians and █ aircraft, and have all occurred during periods of SCP-2585 activity.  While no direct link to SCP-2585 has been determined, the incidents have been covered up to avoid drawing attention to the anomaly.

Three explorations of K2 have been conducted by Foundation operatives during SCP-2585 manifestations.  Due to the conditions inherent to SCP-2585, low visibility on the mountain is a consistent hindrance.  For full information on these explorations, please see below.
