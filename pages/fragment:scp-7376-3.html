**Special Containment Procedures:** In accordance with the [[[integration-program-hub | Integration Program]]], SCP-7376-C is to be employed at Site-17 as a consultant. He is no longer to be referred to with standard object pronouns (it/its) and, outside of SCP documentation, is to be solely referred to by name.

SCP-7376-C has been authorized to move about freely in all areas of the facility open to personnel of Level 2 Security Clearance and below, though he may not travel outside the facility without ETTRA authorization and an escort of at least two guards. A tracking device has been embedded in SCP-7376-C&#39;s left shoulder, which may not be deactivated or surgically removed.

Appropriate supplies for prosthesis maintenance are to be provided to SCP-7376-C. In the event that one or more of his prostheses cease functioning, Foundation personnel may only aid in their repair if given explicit permission from SCP-7376-C or if SCP-7376-C has been incapacitated to the point that he can no longer do so himself.

Botanical and mycological anomalies are not allowed within 10 m of SCP-7376-C. He may not, under any circumstances, be brought within 1 km of SCP-7376-A or SCP-7376-B.

**Description:** SCP-7376-C is a human male of Middle Eastern descent that appears to be in his early thirties. A thaumaturgic sigil that emits trace amounts of akiva radiation[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]**Akiva Radiation:** Particles emitted by objects, entities, and acts directly associated with divine beings.[[/span]] has been etched into his forehead and a significant portion of his body has been replaced with the following anomalous prostheses:

* Prosthetic Hand (Replacing left hand and half of left forearm.)
* Prosthetic Arm (Replacing right arm and right shoulder.)
* Prosthetic Leg (Replacing left foot, calf, and two thirds of thigh.)
* Ocular Implants (Replacing both eyes.)
* Synthetic Organs (Replacing liver and 1.2 m of small intestine.)
* SCP-7376-C-1 (Replacing heart.)
* SCP-7376-C-2 (Replacing cervical vertebrae, occipital bone, and 75% of temporal lobe.)

SCP-7376-C&#39;s prosthetic limbs place a certain amount of strain on his body, to the degree that he occasionally needs additional mobility aids to move about without pain or impairment. When given the chance to replace his prosthetics with superior [[[anderson-robotics-hub | Anderson Robotics]]] models, SCP-7376-C declined, stating an unwillingness to use prostheses that he could not personally disassemble or rebuild from scratch.

All botanical and mycological life placed within 7.7 m of SCP-7376-C will experience senescence at a 220% faster rate. This effect exponentially increases if the plant or fungus in question is physically touched by SCP-7376-C; sustained contact will cause the subject to wither, rot, and disintegrate within 5-310 seconds, depending on its size. Sapient botanical/mycological entities, when placed within SCP-7376-C&#39;s line of sight (at a safe distance), universally report feelings of unease.

SCP-7376-C can remember anything he has seen or heard since SCP-7376-C-2&#39;s activation with perfect recall. He possesses extensive knowledge of many academic fields, to the extent that he has received honorary Foundation doctorates in linguistics, history, engineering, and theology.

**Addendum 7376-C-1: Association with Mekhanism**

Outside of texts connected to Abrahamic religions, the majority of extant documents relating to SCP-7376-C are historical records and religious texts belonging to the [[[church-of-the-broken-god-hub | Church of the Broken God]]].

SCP-7376-C is widely attributed with creating an accumulation of scientific documents, blueprints, sketches, and philosophical musings collectively known as the //Apparatus Liber//. Though the //Apparatus Liber// makes no reference toward Mekhane or its associated mythology, it is considered to be one of Mekhanism&#39;s first holy texts due to its foundational role in Mekhanist philosophy and engineering.

Subsequent Mekhanist texts refer to SCP-7376-C with a number of different names, the most commonly used being Khane, Cone, Qan, Qabil, and Qubit. When asked which name, if any, was true, SCP-7376-C asserted that they were all equally correct.

An antagonistic figure in many SCP-7376-C-oriented Mekhanist narratives is his twin brother, who is commonly referred to as Hedron, Hadron, Hebel, Habil, or Hevit. The word &#34;twin&#34; in this context has two meanings: &#34;gestated together inside the same womb&#34; and &#34;manufactured at the same time.&#34; Mekhanist documents refer to SCP-7376-C both as a human and a machine, sometimes interchangeably within a singular text.

To view all documents with a known or theorized connection to SCP-7376-C, contact Department of History liaison Ajla Hall.

4. MEKHANE cast HER voice, the holy Signal, that which is neither particle nor wave, into the wide world.

5. For a time, the Signal went unheeded, for men had been made deaf to the sound of divinity by their own accursed FLESH.

6. Only the prophet Qabil, who had read the blueprints of creation, could hear HER words.

7. And so, MEKHANE brought Qabil to the people and spoke many great truths through him.

8. But all was not well, for the prophet&#39;s brother, Habil, was an agent of the FLESH.

9. Habil imposed upon the people the deception of FLESH: to think the body a throne of the mind, rather than its prison.

10. And the people turned against Qabil, casting him into the desert so that he would be tortured by sand creatures and slowly starve to death.

11. Qabil walked alone through the desert for 3³ days and 3³ nights, but not once did he falter, for he knew that MEKHANE&#39;s grace was with him.

12. And lo! On the twenty-seventh night, from the northwest heavens a molten star fell. And in that star&#39;s heart was an angel of brass and steel.

**Addendum 7376-C-2: Interview Log C1**

Shortly after SCP-7376-C entered containment, Dr. Sophia Light requested that she be given jurisdiction over all interviews with the anomaly, claiming that {{[LEVEL 5/███ SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIRED]}} would encourage him to speak candidly. Her request was accepted.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Date:** 04/02/2000

**Interviewed:** SCP-7376-C

**Interviewer:** Dr. Sophia Light //(Director, Tactical Theology)//

----

//[SCP-7376-C sits at the interrogation table, his left arm resting on the counter. He is examining the joints in his left hand, testing their flexibility. As Dr. Light enters, he glances up from his work, then startles, performing a double take. He appears faintly shocked.]//

**Dr. Light:** //[Smiling.]// Surprised to see me?

**SCP-7376-C:** {{[LEVEL 5/███ SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIRED]}}

**Dr. Light:** I go by Sophia, now.

//[Dr. Light sits across from SCP-7376-C.]//

**SCP-7376-C:** It is very good to see you again, Sophia. Especially in such a cold and inhospitable place--how have you been?

**Dr. Light:** As much as I&#39;d like to catch up--

**SCP-7376-C:** Yes, yes, my apologies. I&#39;ll tell you whatever you need to know.

**Dr. Light:** Thank you. Now, can you state your name, for the record?

**SCP-7376-C:** I&#39;ve gone by many names over the years—each having equal right to being called mine—but &#34;Cain&#34; should suffice, for the time being.

**Dr. Light:** Very well, Cain. Can you tell me why you turned yourself in to the Foundation three days ago?

**SCP-7376-C:** I am... not sure what you mean. After I was finished telling your researchers about who they&#39;d find in the coffin and what they&#39;d need to do about him, your security arrived to take me away. I didn&#39;t have any choice in the matter.

**Dr. Light:** I sincerely doubt that, Cain. In all the years that the Foundation has been in operation, we haven&#39;t found a //trace// of you—up until now our historians were convinced you&#39;d died somewhere around the fall of Babylon—and now you expect me to believe you couldn&#39;t figure out how to leave us some instructions without getting caught?

**SCP-7376-C:** //[Chuckling.]// Sharp as ever, I see. I apologize for the halfhearted deception.

**Dr. Light:** You can make it up to me by telling me why you&#39;re here.

//[Silence.]//

**SCP-7376-C:** I have some... security measures, in the temple. Nothing dangerous, merely something to alert me when someone intrudes and provide a sort of &#34;shortcut&#34; to the interior. When I discovered that the temple was now under your Foundation&#39;s jurisdiction, I realized I had an opportunity to help right a wrong I once committed, if only partially. That was my first reason for coming here.

**Dr. Light:** And your second?

**SCP-7376-C:** My second reason was more... selfish. You see, when I was a young man, well before we first met, I committed a grave crime. An indelible sin for which there could be no atonement. For my misdeeds, my mother and father placed a curse on me, twice over. 

From my father, I was given a curse of withering. The land decays wherever I lay tread, so that there is no hiding what I have done. From my mother, I was given a vagabond&#39;s curse. A curse of endless wandering, so that I would spend all my days with neither home nor true companionship--though I wonder if she would&#39;ve chosen something else if she&#39;d known quite how many days that would be.

**Dr. Light:** Your parents did this to you?

//[SCP-7376-C waves a hand dismissively.]//

**SCP-7376-C:** It was a kindness. In those days, for a crime such as mine, it was either an eternal curse or the death penalty. We did not have a very robust justice system, I will admit. Anyways, I have come to discover that my mother&#39;s curse has a loophole of sorts. I can only stop my wandering if I am forced to stop--if I am imprisoned.

**Dr. Light:** You&#39;re telling me you //want// to be contained.

**SCP-7376-C:** There&#39;s little in this world I desire more.

//[Silence. Dr. Light appears thoughtful.]//

**Dr. Light:** Why here, though? I&#39;m sure the Broken Church or the [[[horizon-initiative-hub | Horizon Initiative]]] would drop everything to keep you with them, if you asked.

**SCP-7376-C:** The latter define me by the worst thing I have ever done--they would not treat me poorly, I&#39;m sure, but in their hands I would only become another weapon in their endless crusade. The former are the opposite... they know I am blessed by their god and would act accordingly. I do not wish to be worshiped, a clockwork saint locked in a metal shrine. Here, at least, I may be able to accomplish some good, if you allow me to.

**Dr. Light:** Considering how you entered containment willingly, I&#39;m sure my superiors would be open to some kind of arrangement--but that&#39;s a conversation for later.

What&#39;s this you&#39;re saying about being blessed by Mekhane? Are you really its prophet?

**SCP-7376-C:** A simple question with a complicated answer. 

**Dr. Light:** Try me.

**SCP-7376-C:** When I was cursed, I tried to undo my crime... and in doing so, I only deepened my sin. I would spend the following years searching nonstop for a way to mend what I had broken, to rewind what I had unwound--yet with each attempt, I found only greater failure. I was crushed under the weight of it all. It almost killed me. But then one night, as I wandered through the desert, I found God.

**Dr. Light:** You had a religious experience?

**SCP-7376-C:** I&#39;m not speaking figuratively. I&#39;m saying I //found God//—or a very small piece of Her, anyway. It was a kind of brass puzzle box, half-buried in the sand. At the time, I didn&#39;t know what I held was divine, only that it held such… wonders inside. 

I spent months divining its secrets, developing entirely new modes of science and mathematics from what I discovered. And when I had learned all that I could, I split the puzzle box in half and took God into my heart—again, not figuratively. With the aid of my apprentice, I replaced my mortal organ with holy brass, imbuing myself with youth eternal.

**Dr. Light:** An apprentice?

**SCP-7376-C:** The son of a poor stablehand who came to follow me in my wanderings, for a time. It was his idea to reshape the other half of the puzzle box into an archive--

//[SCP-7376-C taps the back of his head.]//

--to stretch my memory alongside my extended lifespan. [[[/system:page-tags/tag/robert-bumaro | Bumaro]]], his name was. A prodigy in every sense of the word... I&#39;ve taken on many a student, but none quite like him.

**Dr. Light:** You haven&#39;t really answered my earlier question. Are you--

**SCP-7376-C:** Am I a prophet? //[Sighing.]// I am not certain. I don&#39;t //feel// like a prophet--I have received no holy visions, no angels have come to me from on high. And yet...

The heart and the head hold great symbolic significance, you see—to replace all of one and part of the other is a dangerous thing. When Bumaro convinced me to implant my archive, I crafted a thaumaturgic sigil—

//[SCP-7376-C gestures to his forehead.]//

--that would keep me metaphysically stable. Only, I have come to discover that this sigil, which I had thought my own creation, is a fragment of Mekhane&#39;s true name. Perhaps, then, the God-In-Many-Pieces has been whispering in my ear all along.

**Dr. Light:** So you&#39;re saying your sigil isn&#39;t the biblical &#34;mark of Cain&#34;--it&#39;s the mark of &#34;Meh-Cain&#34;?

**SCP-7376-C:** //[Smiling.]// I&#39;ve always thought the distinction was rather humorous, yes.

**Dr. Light:** Are your other prostheses similarly divine in origin?

**SCP-7376-C:** Not at all.

**Dr. Light:** Where did they come from?

**SCP-7376-C:** Are you aware of the expression, &#34;may you live in interesting times&#34;?

//[SCP-7376-C&#39;s smile fades.]//

I may be ageless, but I&#39;m not immortal. Suffice to say, I&#39;ve led a //very// interesting life.

//[Silence.]//

**Dr. Light:** Cain.

**SCP-7376-C:** Hm?

**Dr. Light:** Haven&#39;t I let you talk around this for long enough?

//[Silence.]//

//[SCP-7376-C exhales deeply.]//

**SCP-7376-C:** You are right. It&#39;s time I told you about my brother.
