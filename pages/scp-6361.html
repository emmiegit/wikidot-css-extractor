Dr Mikel,

It&#39;s been some time since I&#39;ve seen you. How&#39;re you doing? By the way, the O-5 want you to edit the SCP-6361 article. Sound familiar? Anyways, I haven&#39;t been found out yet. You know what I&#39;m talking about. &#34;We&#39;re always in hiding... never being able to show our true selves.&#34; Isn&#39;t that what you said once? No? Thought so.

Hope you&#39;re enjoying yourself by the way. Guys like us always need to be on the lookout, right? Anyways, I hope personnel don&#39;t confuse SCP-6361-A, B, C and... I forgot, there is no D. Wink wink. Anyways, I hope they aren&#39;t confused with being entirely different anomalies, don&#39;t you think? The O-5 Council //will// hunt down all SCPs, so be on the lookout for them.

Sometimes, they&#39;re among us. Fight fire with fire, and defend water with water.

Stay safe,
Your friend Tanner

Hello Dr Tanner,

It is with great regret I do not have the slightest knowledge of what you are talking about. You could have just said that I needed to edit SCP-6361. Personally, there&#39;s always the feeling that it has tricked us into thinking that it is so dangerous, like it&#39;s a distraction. To quote Sun Tzu:

//&#34;When strong, appear weak. When weak, appear strong.&#34;//

Well, I better get started with the editing. Anyways, people //do// have the right to know.

Stay safe,
Your friend Mikel

[[size larger]] **Special Containment Procedures:** [[/size]] SCP-6361 in the current time is kept in a --standard-- altered containment room, Site-17 as per protocol. Although SCP-6361 has a semi-humanoid form, its body composition does not contain any //solid// biological tissue. Loss of Homo-sapien conscience [[footnote]] What makes humanoids humane. [[/footnote]] results in containment breach and 50% chance of EK Class End-of-reality scenario due to anomolous abilities, explained later. Should the event arise, chosen personnel must move entity to Site-02 immediately. Containment breach in this state will result in an automatic lockdown. Collateral damage to both the foundation and the public definite if situation arises. All foundation required to wear protective clothing Hazmat-6361 for safety.

SCP-6361 is currently under 24-hour audio surveillance. Footage from surveillance cameras unobtainable. [[footnote]] See Cam &amp; Audio Surveillance.Cam01: **&#34;Footage Test A&#34;**. [[/footnote]] Staff note: Changes in Object Class were a result of the constant visual threat significance changes since entity capture. Audible speech exchanged with the entity must be over distance of 3 meters. [[footnote]] [Explained in **Footage Test Run 1** &amp; **Living Organism Test A** under [**ADDENDUM**] ] -Note by Dr W.D. Mikel [[/footnote]]

**Note:** SCP-6361 may threaten personnel or try to blind them for a moment using its anomolous ability to shine light through its eyes. Do not under any circumstances give in to its demands, and if the shine penetrates through Hazmat-6361&#39;s translucent visor, personnel are advised to avert their eyes, looking at the entity throught their central vision rather than peripheral.

Altered changes to SCP-6361&#39;s containment room are as follows:

[[tabview]]
[[tab File: SCP-6361 Containment Room Implemented Features]]
Please view other tabs. Note: SCP-6361&#39;s containment cell has been placed on the highest floor for transportation efficiency in the event of SCP-6361-A. It is surrounded by lead to counter its radioactiveness.
[[/tab]]
[[tab Containment Room: Surrounding Circular Walls]]
//**Note:** The room, of diameter 10 meters, is cylindrical, with the two circles of the said cylinder being the floor and ceiling.//
The walls are made of reinforced Chromium, [[footnote]] Foundation information has been concealed under an actual, different company. Said company deals with girders for global infrastructure. For private information of supplier please view file &#39;T.BO&#39;. [[/footnote]] 1.5 meters thick. At the 0.75 meter mark of the wall, 5 electrical Tungsten wires (spread evenly) are placed. This is to prevent SCP-6361 from escaping. Front exterior has solar panels and 2 small generators for electricity during flight [[footnote]] See &#34;**Auto-Transportation System**&#34; [[/footnote]] .
[[/tab]]
[[tab Reinforced ceiling]]
0.75 meters thick, made of Chromium. Surface of ceiling has 2 centimeter thick Hackmanite [[footnote]] Material known for luminous ability in the absence of light. [[/footnote]] with surface shutters (Steel) that require an analog device, in this case a red button in control room-6361, to operate. This is to prevent escape of entity and/or inflict pain during possible interrogation [[footnote]] This was used on 2/3/2001 [[/footnote]] .
[[/tab]]
[[tab Auto-Transportation System and Control Panel-6361]]
Self-rotating wheels (diameter 10cm) that lift up containment cell. Found on the surroundings of exterior of cell, placed vertically. Large helicopter blades (15cm per blade) for lifting cell up. Roof of Site-17 has shutters which will automatically open if transportation to Site-02 is triggered. 4 Small JetCat P400 jet engines are placed on the left, right and behind each of the cell for maneuvering. These are automatically placed once cell has reached the site roof by small mechanisms implemented in the roof to lift and place the engines.

The Control Panel is found outside of SCP-6361&#39;s containment cell, 4.5 meters away.

++++ SCP-6361-A: Containment &amp; Shipment Procedures

Shipment for SCP-6361-A when entity morphs. Here are the rules, precautions and steps when transferring SCP-6361-A. [&#39;Steps&#39; have been put first due to the efficiency of staff members reading this article in the event of SCP-6361&#39;s transformation.]

**&lt;Steps for Containment &amp; Shipment of SCP-6361-A&gt;**

# Equip special Hazmat-6361 hazmat suits.
# Use the control panel outside of SCP-6361&#39;s containment cell. There should be a red button that, when pushed, should allow the auto-transportation to Site-02.
# In the event of system failure, 2 helicopters (of around the size of that of an Mi-26) should be attached to the removed containment cell for manual removal of entity.
# Members who are not part of the transportation must carry on with daily work routine. Those who are part of manual transportation should finish the transportation within an estimated 10 minutes, as that is how long SCP-XXXX is estimated to take to transform.
# IF AUTO-TRANSPORT MALFUNCTIONS MID-FLIGHT/ANY OTHER COMPLICATIONS, BREACH ALARM IS TO BE SOUND.

**&lt;Rules and Precautions&gt;**

# Do **NOT** attempt communication
# Do **NOT** get distracted
# Remain __Vigilant__
# Work together
# Always make sure that there are no containment leaks
# Look out for infected personnel
# Look out for symptoms
# --Press the Back-up button--

[[size larger]] **Description:** [[/size]] SCP-6361 is classified as male, records of it dating back by centuries. It has a body composition of unidentified radioactive material (when solid). It is capable of turning into a gas, forming either the silhouette of a humanoid or taking on the shape of a cloud. Colour of entity can range from a dark grey to a pitch black. When in the form of a semi-humanoid, black gaseous tendrils circle around it, obscuring its face. When cut in the solid form, the interior of SCP-6361&#39;s body consists of only the gas. The only other notable feature of SCP-6361 is that it has two eyes, that shine a bright light of 80 Lumens, but can increase it to a highest of approximately 120 Lumens. Height of semi-humanoid form is constantly in fluctuation, ranging from 0.25 meters to 5 meters. Gasous form takes up to a controlled test of a 20m X 20m cell, and could potentially cover a much larger area. SCP-6361 also does not sleep.

SCP-6361 possesses a Category 5 level of radiation. It is currently theorised that this causes the static of average cameras when trying to capture videos of the entity. All pictures successfully taken result in failure to show SCP-6361. [[footnote]] As seen in the picture above. [[/footnote]] Entity is capable of teleportation, but cannot teleport through light. Longest recorded range of teleportation was from the Eiffel Tower, Champ De Mars, Paris, France to the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Piazza del Duomo, Pisa, Italy. That made a total of 1070.4 meters. [[footnote]] //This occured while the Foundation was --hunting-- seeking to secure and contain --me-- SCP-6361.// ~Dr Mikel[[/footnote]]

As shown in //&#34;Addendum.6361.3&#34;// , using the special cameras [[footnote]] Meant for video-taking only, unable to take pictures. [[/footnote]] in-cell, SCP-6361 morphed into SCP-6361-A, Security Level classified as Apollyon. After the critical 1-frame footage, SCP-6361-A morphed back into its original form. SCP-6361-A is a highly aggressive form of gaseous SCP-6361. According to the footage, SCP-6361-A takes less than a second to terminate humanoids.

SCP-6361 is capable of human speech. Vibrations coming out of it&#39;s head or it&#39;s gaseous form emit clear and fluent English. After 4 IQ tests [[footnote]] Entity took tests unresistingly. [[/footnote]] , it has been recorded that the entity had an increasing IQ from 58 to 150. As such, foundation researchers have concluded that this corresponds to the entity&#39;s capability of speech, currently solely Englsh. Its intellectual abilities are currently being monitored.

**[EDIT-1, 01/10/2020]:** SCP-6361 now has the ability to read. During an interview, it read the in-cell camera company&#39;s name aloud from the company&#39;s sticker still attached. ~Dr Shrike

**[EDIT-2, 01/14/2020]:** Entity is currently capable of humor. After SCP-6361 agreed to peacefully come outside for fresh air (1.16 a.m., in Hazmat-6361), on the way back to its cell, the accompanying Dr Shrike teased entity of not having genitals. It responded by teleporting to the cafeteria&#39;s freezer to get hold of a counted 69 frozen sausages and back. Said sausages were then teleported into Dr Shrike&#39;s Hazmat. ~Dr Tanner [[footnote]] //Note by Dr Shrike:// I would like to clarify that I no longer hold a grudge as of now. [[/footnote]] [[footnote]] You liar. //~Dr Tanner//[[/footnote]]

Entity has three distinct personalities, one being peaceful, friendly and playful (SCP-6361), another being philosiphical and rational (SCP-6361-B), the last being manic, homicidal and cunning (SCP-6361-C). These personalities neither last more than 48 hours nor end within 5 hours. In rare instances, it will morph into SCP-6361-A. --SCP-6361-D is--

**Critical Information:** Both SCP-6361 and SCP-6361-B claim that SCP-6361-A is highly aggressive and hostile towards any living organism, and would spread what is now classified as the 6361-virus to all humanoids. The 6361-virus, as tested, causes death within 10 seconds from direct contact with the entity, and within 24 hours from coming into contact with an infected individual. Symptoms consist of bleeding from the eyes, mouth, ears and/or nose, vomiting, paralysis, hallucinating, heart attack, diarrhoea, asphyxiation or any combination of the above. It is claimed that SCP-6361-A could happen any time, capable of reaching the size of Earth.

The entity can solidify its tentacles to be sharp and harder than any known material, capable of piercing humanoids. It is termed as &#39;Death&#39; and &#39;The True Darkness&#39; by SCP-6361 itself. Other anomolous abilities include causing hallucinations, consuming humanoids, and causing humanoids to fall comatose. Furthermore, SCP-6361 states that there may come a day when it permanantly changes into SCP-6361-A. It is also capable of speech.

SCP-6361-A is strictly not to be used in any tests to decrease chances of containment breach.

[[size 115%]] **Camera.01: VIDEO RUN; Test Surveillance Screen, Mic.01 and 02. Surveillance Room cam: CONNECTED** [[/size]]

**Surveillance Member Jack Phillips:** (//Speaks into microphone on collar//) Okay, Hawkins, wave at the camera.

**Surveillance Member Joshua Hawkins (In protective suit):** (//Waves at Cam.01//) You can&#39;t see me.

**Phillips:** *Audible Chuckle* Come on, stop foolin&#39; around mate. Anyways, camera 1&#39;s working. Good thing that new arrival&#39;s still in the waitin&#39; room. (//Muffled laughter//)
Hope it hasn&#39;t gotten too attached to this room yet.

**Hawkins:** Hey... (//Hawkins grabs own throat suddenly. Falls down approximately 5 seconds later. Autopsy to confirm cause of death at 6.00pm ETA.//)

**Phillips:** Hawkins? Hawkins! I&#39;m phoning medic... (//Tone fades gradually//)

//SCP-6361 appears on top-right corner of the screen. Footage of entity and surroundings (estimated 0.5 meters) is inconsistent. Area has static on-screen at intervals of 1-3 seconds. 10 seconds pass.//

**SCP-6361-C through microphone on Hawkins&#39;s back (both still in same positions):** ONE HAS DIED. ONE MORE TWO COME. PAST&#39;S LIVING ARE COLD. DEATH UNDONE. Come and find me, L.

**Results:** Camera.01 footage clear if uninterrupted by entity. Audio clear.

**Analysis:** Surveillance Member Joshua Hawkins declared dead on-scene once entity teleported out of room of its own accord. **Cause of death:** Asphyxiation. Unconfirmed reason. Geiger Counter detected slight radioactivity found on victim&#39;s protective clothing. Suspected cause is the 6361-virus.
Surveillance Member Jonas Phillips was found to be deceased in his own residence after being MIA for approximately 48 hours. Site friends of Phillips visited the residence to locate him. Body of victim found on a carpeted floor. Had trail of humanoid blood from left nasal hole to lower lip.

**Notes:** This is the first [known] time SCP-6361 has attempted human speech since capture. &#34;L&#34; has not yet been identified.
