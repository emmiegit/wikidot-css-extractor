[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Tension&#34; hide=&#34;- Tension&#34;]]
&gt; **Tension:**
&gt; The first successful article I ever wrote for this site. Back at the beginning of 2018, I had read [http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-cool-war-hub The Cool War] and hoped to make a series of tales to rival it. Tension was supposed to be the first of this tale series, but unfortunately I lost traction shortly after publishing it. My comment on the article states &#34;more to come at a later date,&#34; and that may still be true, but I have no idea how much later.[[footnote]]At this rate, the time may never come.[[/footnote]]
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ SCP-4084&#34; hide=&#34;- SCP-4084&#34;]]
&gt; **SCP-4084, Then Who Was Phone?**
&gt; Based loosely off a true experience of mine, this article was meant to instill a general fear of the unknown and explore the fear of impersonation and replacement. Within minutes of posting, the article had already gained 2 upvotes, a very positive sign indeed. Though I feel the article may be lacking an actual &#34;narrative&#34; as most SCPs nowadays do, the reception assures that sometimes its okay to be ambiguous. The less you know, the more there is to be afraid of, after all.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ The Gallows Tree&#34; hide=&#34;- The Gallows Tree&#34;]]
&gt; **The Gallows Tree:**
&gt; Probably my least favorite article that I&#39;ve written thus far[[footnote]]Once upon a time, I had a dream of rewriting this article. I decided to leave it be and let this 5 year old article be itself.[[/footnote]], only because of how I limited myself. The concept of a vengeful dryad who was wrongfully convicted in life, and now goes around hanging people in a vain attempt to convict the &#34;true&#34; criminals, is a very interesting one that I should have done more with. Instead, I had the Serpent&#39;s Hand pretty effortlessly subdue her, mitigating the horror of her concept, and included a member who wanted to fuck her, reducing her even further. She started off as a horrific concept that I mitigated because I felt it was //too// horrifying. But, the SCP site is a horror website, and I&#39;ve realized now that I probably shouldn&#39;t be limiting my horror on a site about horrifying people with your writing. In the future, I hope to imbue a little more raw fear, terror, and/or horror into my articles.

[[tab About Me]]
[[include component:image-block-peppo
|name=furry.png|
|caption=My fursona. Her name is Lavender.
|width=300px
]]
My name is Julianna Basco. I am a twenty-three year old Polish-American transgender woman, born in New Jersey on October 31st, 2000. I am currently in my senior year of college, studying for a Bachelors of Arts degree in Interdisciplinary Studies with concentrations in Design Studies and English Literature. As I was born on Halloween, my zodiac sign is ##005682|Scorpio.## My favorite color is lavender, specifically the hex code [[span style=&#34;background-color:black;&#34;]]##C7BFE6|#C7BFE6.##[[/span]] What kind of person even has a specific hex code as their favorite color? Me, apparently. My favorite dish is basically any type of curry, my favorite candy is dark chocolate, and my favorite drink is root beer.

Ever since I learned how to talk, I&#39;ve always been interested in telling stories to others. I dabble in various artistic mediums and have a lot of experience with writing, as well as moderate experience with drawing and composing music. Aside from my artistic endeavors, I enjoy playing video games and tabletop roleplaying games quite a lot. I have thousands of hours in various games on Steam.

I&#39;ve been playing Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition since January 2017, currently running my [http://the-compendium.wikidot.com/series:disciples-of-atropus second original campaign]. I have recently started expanding into other tabletop roleplaying game systems, such as Monster of the Week and Skyfarer. I am currently running my [http://the-compendium.wikidot.com/series:sunstokers first original Skyfarer campaign].

Writing for the SCP Foundation has been difficult, but it&#39;s a struggle I&#39;ve been working at since March 2016. Luckily, three of my attempts have been successes. In the future, I hope to continue to write for the SCP Foundation and create articles that are both intriguing to the reader and meet my own personal expectations of my work.

[[tab Last Will &amp; Testament]]
If one day I should no longer return to the SCP Wiki, whether it be due to a lack of interest, stress from a busy life, my death, or some combination of all three, this section of my author page serves as my last will and testament as to what shall be done with my work on the site.

In the event that I suddenly drop off the face of the Earth due to unforeseen circumstances that may or may not involve my spontaneous death, the below guidelines should be followed when handling the future of my works:

- My work may be mentioned, quoted, borrowed, transformed, etc. in any other work of SCP-related media and any other article on the site as the author pleases, so long as it falls within the guidelines of the copyright license of all work on the SCP Foundation site.

- If the quality of my work has deteriorated over time and another author wishes to rewrite it, they may send me a personal message on Wikidot or attempt to contact me via Discord. If I fail to respond within one month, they may be granted permission to rewrite my work within my guidelines.

- It is important that the core concept of my work, whether it be an anomaly, a tale, or a Group of Interest format page, is preserved. This includes the personality of any characters included therein. Characters may be entirely cut from the article if it is felt that they do not work and/or contribute nothing to the narrative, but their personalities may not be changed. Dialogue may be altered so long as it meets this guideline.

- I understand that the personality of a fictional character is something that can only be truly known by their original creator, and thus any mention of keeping a character&#39;s personality intact is to be understood within the purview of the rewrite author and the community&#39;s subjective interpretations of the character&#39;s personality. If the community feels that changes to the character&#39;s dialogue and actions have caused their personality to deviate too far from their original incarnation, corrections should be made accordingly.
