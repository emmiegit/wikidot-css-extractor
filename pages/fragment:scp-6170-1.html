**Special Containment Procedures:** The corpse of SCP-6170 is stored in a Cryogenic Biovault at Area-34. Personnel are allowed access with permission from the SCP-6170 Project Head and one member of the O5 Council. Under no circumstances is the corpse of SCP-6170 to be dissected, modified, or otherwise desecrated. [[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Draugr-Class Objects are considered Neutralised or Decommissioned, but ongoing anomalous phenomena originates from them.[[/span]]

Anomalies affected or created by SCP-6170-A are to be catalogued underneath a SCP-6170-B designation, but still retain a main database slot. If at all possible, SCP-6170-B instances are to be decommissioned.
           
**Description:** SCP-6170 refers to a sentient entity that, until an incident in mid-2016, existed within ██████████, Ohio. SCP-6170 demonstrated stabilizing effects on anomalous phenomena, not just in its general vicinity but throughout reality. Objects with anomalous traits brought close to SCP-6170 would have these properties diminished, or in some cases, outright nullified.

In mid-2016, due to circumstances outside of the Foundation&#39;s control, SCP-6170 was fatally wounded via gunshot wound. At first, no negative effects from its death were recorded and SCP-6170 was classified as Neutralised. However, recent analysis indicates that this incident has resulted in an increased amount of anomalous activity[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]For context, the amount of SCPs classified per year in [[[changes at site 18 |1976]]] was 3,406. In 2010 it was 5,231, in 2015 it was 5,754, and in 2017 it was 19,233.[[/span]]. Some preexisting anomalies have exhibited drastic changes in their nature, further deviating from normalcy. This ongoing event has been classified as SCP-6170-A.

On top of the above proliferation of the anomalous, reality has also begun to show signs of deterioration and collapse. The Average Hume Level for Earth and the surrounding space had decreased by 0.02Hm between 2016 and 2017, a stark difference from the previous annual decline of 5^^-12^^Hm.

Alongside the increased rate of anomalous activities noted above in the Description, a sharp increase in what could be considered &#34;negative&#34; events has occurred. This has ranged from the installation of dictatorships in third-world countries to an up-mark in the amount of annual natural disasters. On top of this, many preexisting anomalies have shown alterations to their anomalous properties. In many of these cases these alterations have resulted in properties that either pose a greater risk to human life or actively attempt to break the Veil. Below is a non-exhaustive list of anomalies affected by SCP-6170-A.

During a containment breach two weeks after the death of SCP-6170, SCP-682 managed to escape into a local mountain range. After a month of searching, SCP-682 was discovered to have turned into a fleshy, stationary structure resembling a dead tree. Instead of fruits, SCP-682 bears small, reptilian-like organisms. The organisms demonstrate the same adaptability and regenerative ability as SCP-682. While they regenerate at a much slower pace and have shown to be capable of being terminated, they still pose a considerable threat.

The &#34;minds&#34; SCP-963 had previously overridden have all simultaneously resurfaced, causing irreparable damage to the psyche of Dr. Jack Bright. While it was originally believed that the individuals SCP-963 were completely destroyed, this development has revealed that the amulet stores them in a similar fashion to [[[SCP-3663]]]. This has resulted in a condition similar to Multiple Semi-Personality Overlap, in which more than one individuals attempt to co-exist within the same body and exert control over the others.

Throughout the world, multiple unrelated species of the Mammalia, Reptilia, Aves, and Amphibia classes suddenly gained sapience. A myriad of animal civilizations formed throughout the world, most of which follow a social order similar to SCP-1845. A majority of these feudal civilizations follow a denomination of Christianity which states that Adam and Eve were in fact two [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_universal_common_ancestor prokaryotic cells] given life by God. Their beliefs also postulate that all non-hominoids are the true inheritors of the Earth, and that humans are merely a roadblock put there by the Devil. While a majority of these civilizations have yet to show active hostility towards humans, some of the pre-established ones (such as SCP-1845 and SCP-3932-Δ) have declared war on humanity at large.
@@@@
**Update 02/12/2101:** Species within the Arthropoda phylum and Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes classes have begun to show signs of sapience and active hostility towards humanity.

**Project Overview:** Project Attis was created by the SCP-6170 team and in accordance with several thaumaturgic rituals.

**Abstract:** Project Attis was commissioned by Dr. Cole Thereven, and assigned to MTF-PSI-8, for the revival of SCP-6170. During its lifetime, baseline reality was unaffected, carrying on as per usual. After Its death, the anomalous began to diverge from their usual abilities, and Hume levels dropped.

**Project Information:** The revival of item SCP-6170 is important to normalcy and to the survival of mankind.

Several actions are in order, In the category of Anomalous technology integration, and thaumaturgic rituals. During the SCP-6170 event, SCP-447 went through a sublimation process, turning into a gas. It was eventually decided upon to combine item SCP-447 with the disposed corpse of D-1512134. listed below is an interview, categorized as a peak event in the SCP-6170 process.

 **SCP-447-2:** Dammit, this body has really gotten a beating. What the hell happened to it?

 **Dr. Thereven:** Best you&#39;re gonna get. Shall we start the interview?

 **SCP-447-2:** .....

 **Dr. Thereven:** Who are you?
 
 **SCP-447-2:** Well, I was a warrior, for starters. But that hasn&#39;t been for a //long// time if you know what I mean.  

**Dr. Thereven:** What //do// you mean?

**SCP-447-2:** For the longest time I&#39;ve been trapped in that thing of slime. Immortality, tight living space.

 **Dr. Thereven:** How did you get trapped in it?

 **SCP-447-2:** Well, I was a poor man, then. I went to the maze, to fight that damn cow, and earn a little something.

**Dr. Thereven:** Wait- are you talking about a minotaur?

**SCP-447-2:** Well, but of course. And by the gods, they didn&#39;t fucking tell me there would be a monster cube running about, in addition to the jacked-up bull.

 **Dr. Thereven:** Ok? Then?

 **SCP-447-2:** Hold on, son. I&#39;m old. I cant recount with your voice echoing through my head, so shut.

 **Dr. Thereven:** //sigh// of course.

**SCP-447-2:** Let&#39;s see- I went to fight the minotaur, in the maze-

 **Dr. Thereven:** You already covered that.
 
 **SCP-447-2:** -and the cube came up right behind me and just- knocked me over. I guess I bit off a bit more I could chew. (//nervously laughs//)

**Dr. Thereven:** Ok- we&#39;re getting somewhere now. (//Dr. Thereven takes a clipboard from the table, and a pen and begins to write//) Anything else?

**SCP-447-2:** It almost felt like I was sharing a body with something.... unhuman. Just was really weird for many years. We just stayed in the maze. I started to learn that-

**Dr. Thereven:** Yes?

**SCP-447-2:** I had a stale soul. It was being preserved by the goop. But it could all change if I found a vessel. I roamed the world for so long, trying to find one. I soon found myself at the sunniest place I&#39;ve felt for [[[scp-447 | a long time]]]. So many people populating the place.

**Dr. Thereven:** And?

**SCP-447-2:**  //**And**// then you pissants came along, locked me up.

(//SCP-447-2 sighs//)

**SCP-447-2:** I&#39;ve got a question.

**Dr. Thereven:** Yup?

**SCP-447-2:** Why is it that I was brought back?

**Dr. Thereven:** The death of SCP-6170. It turned you into a gas. We thought combining you with a corpse would help, but that&#39;s not looking so good right now...

**SCP-447-2:** SCP-6170? What&#39;s that?

**Dr. Thereven:** Well um... **[REDACTED PER O5 COUNCIL REQUEST]**

**SCP-447-2:** By Zeus!!!

**Dr. Thereven:** What?

**SCP-447-2:** That thing is a god- quite a force to be reckoned with.

**Dr. Thereven:** (//Dr. Cole Thereven speaks under his breath//) Holy crap, Jack was right.

**SCP-447-2:** Jack who?

**Dr. Thereven:** Nevermind that. We need to revive it, so things can go on their merry way, and reality can carry as per usual.

**SCP-447-2:** It would prove difficult. A being like that carries reality on its shoulders. You need to repair reality itself. You need magic.

**Dr. Thereven:** This just got tougher.

Acting on information gathered from the interview in Addendum.6170.3, the Department of External Affairs held meetings with religious members of the Global Occult Coalition&#39;s Council of 108, believing that one of them either had information on SCP-6170-A, or was directly involved in the death of SCP-6170. As per the Foundation-Coalition Diplomacy Act of 1976, the representatives present at the meeting were placed under a [[[operation-llewyn-dark |Geas]]] barring them from making untruthful statements.

||~ C108 MEMBER ||~ STATEMENT ||
||= The Holy Order of Knights Templar, Reformed || &#34;Yes, we believe our Lord is the one true god, we are not in the business of committing deicide. Those who believe in false idols will falter at their own hands.&#34;  ||
||= Servants of the Silicon Nornir || &#34;Why would we partake in a murder, especially one such as this? I do not see how killing this &#39;SCP-6170&#39; would aid us in bringing about our True Silicon Goddess. Those Satanists, however. This seems right up their alley.&#34; ||
||= The Universalist Order of the Æsir || &#34;I want you to look me in the eyes, Foundie, and tell me: How the fuck would killing this god help us? Did it help fulfill the prophecy of Ragnarök? Does it help us unite the world to aid Æsir? No, no it fucking did not. Now, could you please, oh so kindly, fuck off?&#34; ||
||= The United Church of Satan, Scientist || &#34;Foundation, you should know full well that we haven&#39;t done any deicide in well over a decade. Our agreements both with the GOC and our fellow Councilmembers bar us from doing any such thing. If anything, we are just the Devil&#39;s Advocate for this Council. I can ensure you we took no part in this thing&#39;s death. I&#39;m not even entirely sure it //is// a God. Your file doesn&#39;t mention a single thing about it giving off Akiva Radiation.&#34; ||

Dr. Akabi Hayk, the interviewer in Addendum.6170.5, was informed of the lack of useful information gleaned from the correspondence with the Council of 108. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Akabi Hayk submitted a letter of resignation to her supervisor, citing a &#34;lack of competence and expertise required to properly aid the Foundation during these trying times.&#34;

A reevaluation of the interview revealed it to be complete gibberish, with no deeper meaning behind it. What Dr. Hayk had taken to mean something was instead unrelated words strung together by the different personalities within SCP-963 attempting to express themselves.

**DATE OF INCIDENT:** 23/11/2021

**WITNESSING PERSONNEL:** Dr. Cole Thereven, Mobile Task Force Beta-7, ISCP-239.

**DESCRIPTION:** The death of SCP-6170 caused reality to collapse, and baseline anomalies started to diverge from their regular attributes. Discussion among the O5 council resulted in an attempt to revive SCP-6170 via anomalous technology.

On 23/11/2021, in an attempt to alleviate the effects of SCP-6170&#39;s death, Project Attis attempted to revive the entity via the usage of other anomalies and paratechnology.

The revival was considered a success. Despite this, no noticable changes in Hume levels and reality were observed. The now revived SCP-6170, seemingly distraught by its resurrection, went on a rampage, escaping its containment chamber and fatally wounding 5 Foundation personnel. Before further damage could be done, Mobile Task Force Beta-7 was dispatched and successfully terminated SCP-6170. Among those killed in the breach was Dr. Cole Thereven, a prominent member of the anomaly&#39;s research team.

Project  Attis was a failure. Hume levels continue to decrease at an ever-increasing rate, and the amount of anomalies detected on a yearly basis continues rising at a steady rate. The Project&#39;s assets, including SCP-239, were liquidated and redistributed to other, more essential parts of the Foundation.

This vote entailed the revival of Dr. Cole Thereven, via anomalous technology. This would exempt the portions of the body that suffered massive damage, and extreme blood loss. The head was the only portion of the body that avoided mass trauma. Foundation forces were stretched thin as a result of SCP-6170-A, so finding personnel to fill Thereven&#39;s role was a waste of resources.

Materials included in Thereven&#39;s revival were:

**-** Anomalous preserving brine,

**-** Water conducted wires embedded within Thereven&#39;s brain,

**-** A base, allowing Thereven to attain new memories.

**-** Speakers, allowing Thereven to communicate.

The surgery was considered a success, reviving Thereven.
