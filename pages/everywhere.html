It&#39;s everywhere. he can see it, all over the place. That man over there, he has it. The Pestilence.

The doctor groaned for what felt like the five thousandth time today. He always groaned when he saw someone with a case of the Pestilence.

//Everyone around him is infected. He has to save all of them.//

He saw a man in a white lab coat look through the heavy, bulletproof window of the room. That man had the Pestilence too. He could see it, crawling, all over their little human skins. In every little orifice on their faces, on the hands that were resting on the table.

Another man approached the one at the window. He&#39;s caught it too. What a shame.. he seemed to be completely fine until he went up to that infected //thing//.

Then, after some small talk, those two left. What pitiful expressions they had on their face.. They looked so happy, despite being inflicted with such a devastating blight.

How, the doctor thought, could they possibly be so joyful? So full of glee, despite their imminent deaths?

//He had to rescue everyone. He was their only chance at true happiness.//

049 had been nothing but amiable, agreeable, affable, with them. Yet they locked him up in this cold, barren chamber, and refused to let him save anyone. Humans are so cruel, whether it be to the unknown or to themselves.

He saw another infected man. The doctor felt the Pestilence creeping up his feet. Gently and slowly entwining its spindly roots with his legs. The doctor couldn&#39;t express his sheer rage at the horror in front of him with just a groan.

So he slowly raised his hand, as if delivering divine retribution to a wretched beast. Then, 049 brought it down, briskly. He brought it down on the pandemic that tormented humanity.

//Tormented himself.//

Then, an intercom activated.

&#34;049, we heard that. What&#39;s wrong?&#34;

&#34;Nothing. Just..&#34;

The doctor brought his fingers, his miracle wrought hand, to the bridge of his nose.

&#34;The Pestilence just.. it&#39;s irritating. Like a little ringing in thy ears, one that cannot be silenced.

049 sighed.

&#34;Not to worry, doctor. I will not act out. Go along now.&#34;

&#34;...Alright. Don&#39;t do anything stupid now. If you need a test subject to vent on, just ask me.&#34;

The speaker then silenced itself.

He sat up, gently pushing in his chair.

God damned it. The doctor started to feel cornered, as if he wasn&#39;t already trapped in this cell. But it was even worse now, with the Pestilence prancing around him so fervently. There was a particular tension in his back that he couldn&#39;t get rid of so easily.

Despite being a medical man, he had trouble breathing, and he couldn&#39;t properly regulate the wrath in his mind. The doctor couldn&#39;t find his patience, as he&#39;d spilled it all over the floor when he&#39;d had his little outburst.

His body, the antithesis to the Pestilence, was tersely responding to such a plight.

His body, made to destroy the Pestilence, was rejecting its own plagued environment.

The doctor, who never wavered in his efforts.. That doctor now wanted to give up. 049&#39;s hollow eyes strained themself at this revelation.

//How could he give up? He is humanity&#39;s last chance. He couldn&#39;t give up, he had to save them all.//

The doctor&#39;s stance wobbled slightly. Quietly, he rested his hands on the table. He had a fierce expression, although it wouldn&#39;t be easy to tell.

He took a deep breath. Then, another, and another, and another.. His pace was steady and clear now. The doctor knew he had to be steady and clear. He couldn&#39;t be anything //but// steady, clear, calculated, and precise.

A chuckle resounded in the cell.

//How humorous. Humanity&#39;s savior, almost giving in to the ultimate threat?//

//Back to business now.//
