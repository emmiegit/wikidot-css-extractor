**Special Containment Procedures:** Researcher Booth has been permitted to keep SCP-6299 as a personal pet. It is to be monitored in case any potential anomalous abilities manifest once again.

**Description:** SCP-6299 is a male Australian Cattle Dog weighing approximately 15 kilograms. SCP-6299 was an avid reality bender and experienced an internal Hume reading of approximately 160 Humes. When not bound by a Scranton Reality Anchor, SCP-6299 expressed the ability to instantaneously teleport to nearby locations, manifest objects seemingly at the command of personnel, and perform other anomalous actions such as levitation and material manipulation. SCP-6299&#39;s range of influence appeared to be about 100 meters.

**Addendum:** Following neutering surgery[[footnote]] Under Article III paragraph iv of the Anomalous Animal Longevity Guidelines, neutering male anomalous animals, especially canines, is performed for the sake of reducing the probability of said anomalous animal developing testicular cancer, among various other prostate diseases.[[/footnote]] on April 10, 2017, SCP-6299&#39;s ability to manipulate reality had been severely hindered. Over the course of 48 hours, SCP-6299 had become completely unable to perform anomalous actions. Kant counters showed no overly dramatic Hume deviations in SCP-6299&#39;s presence. Investigations to uncover why SCP-6299 had lost all anomalous abilities had gone underway and it was found through Hume readings at the clinic where SCP-6299 was neutered that SCP-6299&#39;s surgically removed testicles continued to have high Hume deviations. 

SCP-6299&#39;s testicles were placed in cold storage, but Hume readings continuously lowered until the object had reached an equilibrium with its surroundings. SCP-6299 and its testicles have been deemed neutralized and testing/documentation with the object has been altered to fit the new findings.</textarea></pre>
