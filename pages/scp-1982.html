**Item #:** SCP-1982

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The area 2 km around SCP-1982 is to be monitored with video surveillance, and no less than two guards. On 08/23 the area is to be scouted for individuals heading toward SCP-1982&#39;s location. Instances of SCP-1982-1 are stopped and turned away from SCP-1982 according to disinformation protocol &#34;First Fumigated&#34;.

**Description:** SCP-1982 is a church in Blairsville, Georgia covered by a fumigation tent. Public records show that the building has been condemned for 19 years, and was previously the location of &#34;The First Southern Fifth Church of Georgia&#34;. Inspection of the interior reveals the area to be empty, save for 10 rows of pews, a large wood-burning furnace, and an altar. SCP-1982 exhibits no anomalous properties for the majority of the year. SCP-1982&#39;s notable effects at most times only present themselves with the appearance of SCP-1982-1, if SCP-1982-1 appears on 08/23. If SCP-1982-1 appears on a date other than 08/23 no effect can be observed.

Noise and vocalizations can be heard from the inside of SCP-1982 at random intervals throughout the year, though the sound is extremely muffled and only audible when in close proximity. It is the consensus of those presiding over SCP-1982&#39;s containment that the dominant sound is a male voice with a heavy lisp, shouting. Multiple other human voices can be heard, usually repeating parts of phrases spoken by the main speaker. All noise emitted from SCP-1982 ceases two seconds before a human individual, animal, recording device, or artificial entity enters, or views the interior. Attempts to record this noise have failed in all instances.

When a specific humanoid[[footnote]] With the exception of one parrot (08/23/1998), and one squirrel (08/23/2002).  [[/footnote]] entity enters the vicinity of SCP-1982 on 08/23, an entity identified as &#34;Celebration &#39;Big Cheese&#39; Horace&#34; will exit SCP-1982 to greet the individual (SCP-1982-1) and invite them into SCP-1982. SCP-1982-1 have been limited to residents of Georgia and outlying states noted to have significant wealth and fame. Instances of SCP-1982-1 do not return from SCP-1982 once they have entered. On average, one unique entity approaches SCP-1982 every two years.

SCP-1982-1 does not appear to have any compulsion to travel to or enter the vicinity of SCP-1982, and will only enter after being invited in. Appearance of SCP-1982-1 near SCP-1982 is always coincidental. Allowance of SCP-1982-1 to enter SCP-1982 is subject to current testing protocol and Site Director approval.

**Interview Log:** Observation of 08/23/75. Individual heading toward SCP-1982 is intercepted and held with Foundation agents until interview is complete.

&gt; A man&#39;s head sticks out of SCP-1982. It looks at Researcher Ortega and frowns.
&gt; 
&gt; Singing vocalizations from multiple entities appear to be coming from a pipe in the entity&#39;s mouth (referred to in this log as SCP-1982-A). The entity itself does not speak, and makes abnormal facial expressions throughout the course of the interview. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1982-A:** You ain&#39;t ██████ ██████.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Ortega:** Who is speaking now?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1982-A:** The congregation speaks.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Ortega:** Who is this man I am looking at right now?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1982-A:** That&#39;s the cheese himself. Big man, big man. Reverend Archon Celebration Big Cheese Horace. Huff puff fire, fire, fire-^^?^^cracker Horace!
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Ortega:** May we enter the area?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1982-A:** What&#39;s the answer belly dancer? [//wailing//]
&gt; 
&gt; The entity squints its eyes, tilts its head left and right, looking at present researchers, then slowly closes its eyes and shakes its head.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1982-A:** Only round souls. Squares don&#39;t fit in this hole.
&gt; 
&gt; The entity raises its eyebrows, smiles with its mouth open, and slowly draws its head back into the tent.
&gt; 
&gt; Researcher Ortega attempted to enter SCP-1982 with SCP-1982-1 shortly after the interview and found the area to be empty. After exiting, SCP-1982-A reappeared and verbally berated Researcher Ortega, stating that &#34;they could do this all day&#34;. After five hours SCP-1982-1 was allowed in SCP-1982 alone.

**Excerpts from Georgia 1598 AM:** This radio signal is broadcast for two minutes each year on 08/23 in a radius of 2km.

1966
&gt; We got talent comin&#39; brothers and sisters. Fresh talent. Two Shoes █████████████ Biggum&#39;s - the one from the radio! Sweet tones, and a sweeter smell I&#39;d like to think! Sandy, won&#39;t you go on and roll that footage of the dancin&#39; frog now?

No. Gotta slink in real smooth like a smell, and - understand now brothers - you gotta destroy the body. Break it down. That&#39;s what them northers don&#39;t understand.
1988
&gt; Not all y&#39;all are just about ready to //inbreathe//. I mean, not all you even //can//. What? Jeff? Hah! You think you got as much pungenacity as █████████████? Come on now. Sit down, go head sit down son. No one wants you stinkin&#39; up their kitchen.
1998
&gt; Hold on now we got a visitor outside! Who COULD it be? [sounds of murmuring, followed by the dominant voice shouting and cursing] This is the talent of &#39;98 friends! Fuckin&#39; cluckatoo twoshoes the no money-havin&#39; fuckin&#39; dancin&#39; parrot! Someone get me some Peter Hayden or I am going to blow you all to hell like a divine flatulent. The hell we gonna get out of a fuckin&#39; parrot? A righteous //thank you// to our friends in the meat hole outside, I //declare//.
2001

Glowing Hands, the lord there //Himself// ain&#39;t smilin&#39; about it but hell, we don&#39;t got much to work with. But then again we don&#39;t got stankin&#39; smoke like them northern Fivers now do we? You enter now, brother Chatters the Four-Footed Squirrel //Himself//. Smoke is freedom brother. Cleanse that spirit, and we shall have a short break after that incineration. Y&#39;all can take a quick piss now or what have you. I need a drink.
2008
&gt; Gifts are available if y&#39;all want something to bring home. Hell, this old bag of Peter Hayden //Himself// tobacco is waiting for your pipe... or doobie, for you hip types. Go on and buy it now, we can&#39;t keep this show goin&#39; on... what&#39;s that Jimmy? Fumes! Hah! I&#39;m tellin&#39; ya! Fumes he says. Can&#39;t keep it going on fumes! People, next year and every year till 3███, we will show you that World 390 Broadcast Star is not a dying star, not a fadin&#39; signal. No way. We have not reached our goal donation, but we have reached each other&#39;s hearts. Ladies and gentlefriends. I&#39;m getting sentimental and I think I need to light up some of this //Richard Smith// before I cry. [//sniffling//]
