**Item #:** SCP-2997
&gt;   
**Object Class:** Safe
&gt;   
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2997 is to be stored in a high value observation chamber. It is to be placed on a pedestal in the center of its chamber, and every surface is to have cameras installed as to monitor the activities of SCP-2997-2. In the event that SCP-2997&#39;s tracking chip exits Site-242, Mobile Task Force Lambda-37 (&#34;Geiger Counters&#34;) is to be dispatched immediately in an effort to retrieve SCP-2997.
&gt;    
**Description:** SCP-2997 is an ornate urn constructed of smokey quartz[[footnote]] A variety of quartz whose coloration comes from free silicon formed by irradiation acting on silicon dioxide. [[/footnote]] originating from Japan in the sixteenth century. It absorbs all forms of radiation coming into contact with it except for visible light. There are two Japanese inscriptions on SCP-2997 that read, &#34;Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.&#34; and, &#34;They believed.&#34;
&gt;    
SCP-2997-1 is a pile of human ashes contained within SCP-2997. It constantly releases a varying amount of gamma radiation. The amount of radiation released at any given point has ranged from lethal to infinitesimal.
&gt;   
SCP-2997-2 is a collective designation for a group of two-dimensional figures that may be seen on any surface with a direct line of sight to SCP-2997. Instances of SCP-2997-2 resemble nuclear shadows[[footnote]] A phenomenon caused by an object or life form absorbing the radiation from a nuclear blast that would normally have a bleaching effect on a surface located behind it, resulting in a dark area (&#34;shadow&#34;) wherever the object or life form blocked the radiation from bleaching. [[/footnote]] of human beings of variable age, gender, height, weight, etc. Instances of SCP-2997-2 can be seen performing many different actions, but the most common ones resemble praying at an altar, treating burns, conversing, or attending what resembles a Roman Catholic mass. All attempts at communication with instances of SCP-2997-2 have been unsuccessful.
&gt;    
SCP-2997 was found in the basement of The Church of St. Joseph in Omura, Japan where it was being used as a centerpiece in a shrine. The search was launched following multiple reports of an &#34;Urn of Souls&#34; in a church somewhere near Nagasaki, Japan. A squad from Mobile Task Force Chi-3 (&#34;Exorcists&#34;) was dispatched to ascertain the existence of and retrieve it. Upon arrival at the Church of St. Joseph, MTF Chi-3 was attacked by a member of the congregation who was praying at the shrine containing SCP-2997 at the time. He was successfully sedated and all witnesses were questioned about SCP-2997 before receiving amnestics. The head priest at The Church of St. Joseph produced a burned piece of parchment from a safe and claimed that he found it and SCP-2997 resting on a piece of the altar from Urakami Cathedral[[footnote]] Urakami Cathedral was a Roman Catholic cathedral located 500m away from the epicenter of the nuclear explosion over Nagasaki. It was in mass at the time of the bombing and all inside were killed.[[/footnote]] under a small pile of rubble. A transcript of the document can be found in addendum 2997-02.
&gt;   
**Addendum 2997-01:** On ██/██/██ an instance of SCP-2997-2 resembling //Canis lupus familiaris//[[footnote]] Domestic dog. [[/footnote]] was seen walking with two instances of SCP-2997-2 that resembled men carrying rifles.
&gt;   
**Addendum 2997-02:** A transcript of the document recovered with SCP-2997:

&gt; Jesus said to her, &#34;I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?&#34;
&gt;
