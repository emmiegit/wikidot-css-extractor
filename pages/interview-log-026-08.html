**Dr. █████:** &#34;Please have a seat.&#34;

**Agent Walker:** &#34;Thank you.&#34;

**Dr. █████:** &#34;Let&#39;s get down to business.  I understand you&#39;re requesting a transfer out of fieldwork.  Would you like to talk about that?&#34;

**Agent Walker:** &#34;I&#39;d rather not.&#34;

**Dr. █████:** &#34;It&#39;s your choice.  However, I can&#39;t approve a transfer without reason.&#34;

**Agent Walker:** &#34;Look, I...&#34;  The agent paused here.  &#34;You&#39;ve seen my record.  You know I worked on twenty-six, right?&#34;

**Dr. █████:** &#34;I&#39;ve read the report.&#34;

**Agent Walker:**  &#34;I was there the first time we took one of the sleepers out.  A lot of them were adults when they disappeared, but they&#39;re kids again when we find them.  So, I see this sixteen-year-old boy just kind of shrivel away.  I had nightmares that night.&#34;

**Dr. █████:** &#34;You&#39;re supposed to report any unusual dreams after contacting a potentially mind-altering phenomenon.&#34;

**Agent Walker:** &#34;It hadn&#39;t been declared a mindscrew yet.  We just thought it was a weird space thing.  We were just watching it until the Picnickers got there.  And it was a shock, you know?  We weren&#39;t expecting anything like that.  Anyway, I got over it quick enough.  I&#39;d seen worse.  I once had a guy melt while I was holding onto him.&#34;

**Dr. █████:** &#34;I see.  What happened next?&#34;

**Agent Walker:** &#34;Nothing, for a while.  I went in a couple of times, but didn&#39;t see anything too weird.  But...  Look, I know I should have reported it.  But one of my buddies had just been disappeared after getting touched by some weird scip, and I didn&#39;t want it to happen to me.&#34;

**Dr. █████:** &#34;You&#39;ve been affected by an SCP?&#34;

**Agent Walker:** &#34;I...  Yeah.  It was a week later.  I was dozing in the back of the van, and I started dreaming.&#34;

**Dr. █████:** &#34;Can you describe this dream?&#34;

**Agent Walker:**  &#34;Just like the others.  You&#39;ve read the reports, right?&#34;

**Dr. █████:** &#34;Pretend that I haven&#39;t.  For the record, Agent Walker.&#34;

**Agent Walker:** &#34;All right.  I&#39;m in a classroom.  It&#39;s just like one of the ones in 026, but new.  Not falling apart.  I knew the teacher&#39;s name.  I knew who was sitting by me, even though I&#39;d never seen most of them before.  The bell started ringing, but no one moved.  I raised my hand, but the teacher didn&#39;t notice.  Finally, I tried to leave, but the door wouldn&#39;t open.  Then I noticed something strange with my hand.  It had color.  Everything else was black and white.  But I felt like I was the one who was... wrong?  Out of place?  That&#39;s when I woke up.  The van was leaving.  No one else noticed I&#39;d been asleep.&#34;

**Dr. █████:** &#34;And you didn&#39;t think to report this?&#34;

**Agent Walker:** &#34;Like I said, I was scared.  And this was before they found Malek.  I figured it was just another nightmare.  Nothing weird.  And after Malek had his dream, well, they didn&#39;t do anything with him, so I figured it wasn&#39;t a big deal.&#34;

**Dr. █████:** &#34;He was put on observation.  You should have been as well, for your own safety and for the safety of others.&#34;

**Agent Walker:** &#34;You paper-pushers think it&#39;s all so easy, don&#39;t you?  Sitting behind a desk all day, you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like.  Well, things aren&#39;t so clear out there.  Not when you&#39;re the one hunting talking cats in a sewer, or waiting to see if you&#39;re the one who&#39;s not going to come back this time.&#34;

Agent Walker was visibly distressed.  It was several minutes before she calmed down enough to continue the interview.

**Agent Walker:** &#34;Anyway, it wasn&#39;t until later that we connected the dreams with the sleepers.  Not until they found those Class Ds on the second floor.  Still, I thought I might be okay.  I wasn&#39;t actually inside of twenty-six when I dreamed.  I wasn&#39;t sure until the dreams started.&#34;

**Dr. █████:** &#34;You&#39;re having reoccurances?&#34;

**Agent Walker:** &#34;Yeah.  They started six months ago.  It&#39;s the same dream.  But each time, it takes me a little longer to notice it isn&#39;t real.  And when I look at my hands, they&#39;re a little more gray.&#34;

End interview 026-08

**Note:** Agent Walker has since been given a Class A Amnestic and returned to field work.</textarea></pre>
