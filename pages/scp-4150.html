**Item #:** SCP-4150

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/on-mount-golgotha-hub|Mobile Task Force Eta-11 (“Savage Beasts”)]]] should be dispatched to the location of any reported SCP-4150 instance and secure its source. Affected individuals should be contained and made to listen in full to the song “Penny Lane” by the Beatles. Low-level amnestics are to be administered to all present.
 
SCP-4150-1 is --to be contained in a soundproof standard holding cell-- neutralised and buried at Site-19. SCP-4150-2 through 4 are to be kept in individual standard lockboxes.
 
**Description:** SCP-4150 is an auditory cognitohazard affecting all intelligent life possessing both functioning ears and functioning eyes. Beings considered clinically deaf or blind are unaffected. 
 
SCP-4150 resembles the 1967 Beatles song “Penny Lane”, but features several lyrical corruptions (see Document 4150-Alpha). Testing has determined that these corruptions are a feature rather than the source of SCP-4150’s anomalous properties.
 
Individuals who hear SCP-4150 in full feel a powerful urge to reproduce SCP-4150 (vocally or otherwise) and pass its effect to as many other individuals as possible. Spread is typically slow, taking at least three minutes and three seconds (3:03) to fully transfer from one individual to another.
 
SCP-4150-1 through 4 are objects determined to be the source of SCP-4150 outbreaks. SCP-4150-1, retrieved 11/30/2016 (deceased 05/02/2018) was Mr. Simon █████, the singer for a Beatles tribute band. SCP-4150-2 and SCP-4150-3, retrieved 02/27/2018, are a pair of freestanding stereo speakers. SCP-4150-4 is the mobile phone of Researcher D█████. SCP-4150-4’s internet browser was opened to a radio website (designated SCP-4150-4.1) apparently created by avant-garde movement Are We Cool Yet? The internet domain was seized by the Foundation on 04/12/2018.

[[tab Incident Report 4150-4]]
 
**Incident Report 4150-4**
  
&gt; **Date:** 04/10/2018
&gt; 
&gt; **Incident Details:** At approximately 14:37, Researcher D█████ accessed SCP-4150-4.1, using SCP-4150-4, through unknown methods. Security footage shows Researcher D█████ appearing increasingly agitated over the next five to ten minutes. It is suspected that Researcher D█████ was aware that he had been compromised but was unable to resist the compulsion.
&gt; 
&gt; At 14:52, Researcher D█████ accessed a security station at Site-19 and subdued a guard using a small Taser unit before broadcasting SCP-4150 through the site tannoy system.
&gt; 
&gt; The system was shut down externally at 14:54, before SCP-4150 could be broadcast in full.
&gt; 
&gt; At 14:57, Researcher D█████ was shot and killed by guards.
&gt; 
&gt; Thirteen (13) staff members were later compromised via a group email D█████ had sent from the security station with SCP-4150 attached as an audio file. All these incidents were contained.
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** A total of thirty-three (33) personnel were fully compromised, and a further two hundred and twelve (212) required treatment.

[[tab Interview 4150-1.1]]
 
**Interview 4150-1.1**
 
&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-4150-1
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Roth
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log, [10:50]&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** SCP-4150-1? My name is Roth. I’d like to ask you a few questions.
&gt; 
&gt; **4150-1:** How long are you gonna be keepin’ me in here? I’ve done nothin’ wrong!
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** All we’re trying to determine is how you caused this phenomenon.
&gt; 
&gt; **4150-1:** I didn’t cause nothin’! It came to me. Whispered its way into the back of my head, peeled the muscle and bone apart and burrowed its way into my ear.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** The phenomenon was physical?
&gt; 
&gt; **4150-1:** Yeah. No. Maybe. There weren’t any scar. Any mark. Just the itch like there shoulda been one. Ya know what I’m sayin’?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** Would you say there was an intelligence behind this? Something malevolent?
&gt; 
&gt; **4150-1:** I… I don’t know. It. It sure had a, uh, purpose. A meaning.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** Like a message?
&gt; 
&gt; **4150-1:** Yeah! A message! Like it was trying to tell me somethin’, tryna let the whole world know what was comin’. Because, like, I had an audience. Because I was //attuned//. So it, like, took my form, took my aspect and angle and like. Bent itself through me like I was a lens and my music, Lennon’s music and McCartney’s music, that was a mould for it to press itself into, refracted through a billion billion lil’… holes…
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** Are you okay?
&gt; 
&gt; **4150-1:** It wears on me nowadays. The way it forced isself into me, it like, frayed me at the edges. And now I’m so tired all the time…
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** How about the concert? What can you tell me about the event?
&gt; 
&gt; **4150-1:** I’m so tired. Can’t ya help me, doc?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** I’m not a doctor. I’m just -
&gt; 
&gt; **4150-1:** It’s in me. Spiraled in deep down in the bones. It’s all I see and hear.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** I think we should continue this conversation later -
&gt; 
&gt; **4150-1:** Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** [Into microphone] Requesting extraction immediately.
&gt; 
&gt; **4150-1:** Deep beneath the blue suburban skies.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Personnel enter the room and sedate SCP-4150-1.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log, [10:57]&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Researcher Roth reported an “earworm”. Upon listening to “Penny Lane” in full, this ceased. SCP-4150-1 was strongly suspected to be holding back information.

[[tab Interview 4150-1.2]]
 
**Interview 4150-1.2**
 
&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-4150-1
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Roth
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** This interview was scheduled after the discovery of SCP-4150-4 and 4.1.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log, [09:32]&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** Good morning, SCP-4150-1. I hope you’re well rested.
&gt; 
&gt; **4150-1:** My name&#39;s Simon.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** Let’s keep this quick. What does the phrase “Are We Cool Yet?” mean to you?
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4150-1 becomes noticeably agitated.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** Sir?
&gt; 
&gt; **4150-1:** Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes!
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** That isn’t going to work this time, I’m afraid. I’m wearing specialised earplugs.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4150-1 displays sudden frustration and anger.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** Any chance you could answer my question?
&gt; 
&gt; **4150-1:** You’re all fascist pricks. Stiflin’ art. Try’na take music you don’t like and fuck it. Hide it away where, like, no-one can hear it ‘cept the worms.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** So the phenomenon was man-made.
&gt; 
&gt; **4150-1:** No! What kinda hack would – never mind. Music comes from the soul, ya stupid fucks. We just channelled somethin&#39; that was already there. Gave it a way out. That music needs to be heard!
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** And you are affiliated with the group known as Are We Cool Yet?, is that correct?
&gt; 
&gt; **4150-1:** We&#39;re just one collective. We’re dedicated to bringin&#39; down the institutions, like you, by returnin’ power and awareness to the people. Art is freedom and you fuckers are oppressin&#39; it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** But an anomaly like this poses a substantial threat to &#34;the people&#34;, wouldn&#39;t you say?
&gt; 
&gt; **4150-1:** Penny Lane issn&#39;a threat. It’s a warning. I told ya. There’s things out there you won&#39;t never be prepared for. And they’re comin’. Foundation or no.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** What sort of things?
&gt; 
&gt; **4150-1:** Dadadadadadadada.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** Excuse me?
&gt; 
&gt; **4150-1:** Dadadadada.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** Very mature.
&gt; 
&gt; **4150-1:** DADA!
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher:** Thank you for your time.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log, [09:41]&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Shortly after the conclusion of this interview, it became apparent that SCP-4150-1 had stolen Researcher Roth’s pen, with which he stabbed himself in the neck. Subject died a week later on 05/02/2018. The phrase “PENNY LANE IS IN MY EARS AND IN MY EYES” was scrawled on the wall of his cell in blood.

[[tab Document 4150-Alpha]]
 
The album cover depicted on SCP-4150-4.1 while SCP-4150 was playing appeared to be based on the artwork for //1//, a collection of the Beatles&#39; number one chart hits. This implies that there may be an entire album of corrupted songs as yet undiscovered.

In the following transcribed lyrics, differences from the original are underlined.
 
&gt; **Penny Lane – The Beatles (AWCY Remix)**
&gt; 
&gt; In Penny Lane there is a __man who’s__ showing photographs
&gt; Of every head he’s had the pleasure to know
&gt; And __seven__ people that come and go
&gt; Stop and say hello
&gt; 
&gt; On the corner __you are standing__ with a motorcar
&gt; The little children laugh at __you behind your__ back
&gt; __And now your tears are drying to black__ in the pouring rain
&gt; Very strange
&gt; 
&gt; Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
&gt; __Deep__ beneath the blue suburban skies
&gt; I __die__ and meanwhile back in
&gt; 
&gt; Penny Lane there is a __shadow__ with an hourglass
&gt; __Marking seven till the long eternal__ Queen
&gt; He likes to keep the __buried__ engine clean
&gt; It’s a clean machine
&gt; 
&gt; Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
&gt; For a __face__ and finger pie
&gt; In summer meanwhile back
&gt; 
&gt; Behind the shelter in the middle of __an empty space__
&gt; A __hollow__ nurse is selling __children__ from a tray
&gt; And though she __knows that she’s the seventh__ in a play
&gt; She __lies__ anyway
&gt; 
&gt; On Penny Lane the __human slits__ another customer
&gt; __You’re frozen, baby,__ waiting for a trim
&gt; And then the __shadows start rushing in from the pouring veins__
&gt; Very strange
&gt; The __seventh King__ is in my ears and in my eyes
&gt; __Crushed beneath the black and fractured skies__
&gt; I __die__ and meanwhile back
&gt; Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
&gt; __It’s inside me I can’t stop it or we’ll fry__
&gt; Penny Lane
 
Further research into this AWCY cell has been deemed Priority Alpha.
