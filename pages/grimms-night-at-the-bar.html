Paul Lee was driving down the highway in his 2016 Toyota Corolla. His wife, Laura had another argument with him again. She works overtime and pays all the bills while he lazes around at home and then goes out every night and gets drunk. The two also have a son named Sam. Paul never spends time with his son, so Sam has learned to ignore his father. Laura finally snapped one day and kicked Paul out of his house after another one of his drinking nights. 

He drives down an exit and into the parking lot of a nearby bar. He walks in and sits down. The bartender comes from across the bar.

“The usual?” He asks.

Paul nods. He waits patiently for his drink when the man sitting beside him strikes up a casual conversation.

“So. What’re you doing here for the thousandth time, Paul?”

“My wife kicked me out…”

“So what? Screw her! Get drunk, go back, and tell her you’re leaving for good!”

“Maybe you’re right…”

An hour elapses and he leaves the bar. He’s heavily under the influence of alcohol. He gets back into his car, almost completely unaware of the events that will unfold afterward. He drives back down the highway but his car swerves and crashes into the side of the interstate. The highway is surrounded on both sides by forest. Paul stumbles out of the now burning car. He’s bleeding and has a terrible limp. He limps through the forest.

He mumbles to himself. “Did I make it home?”

Suddenly, he starts to hear familiar voices.

“Dad?”

“Sam?” He stammers, “Is that you?”

“Help me dad… I’m deeper in the forest… Mom is here too… She can’t speak…”

“I’m coming!”

Paul stumbles through the forest, clutching his head. The drinks were giving him a splitting headache. He comes to a clearing where the trees seem to surround him in all directions.

“Sam! Where are you?”

The voice comes out from a bush and rustling can be heard.

“Come closer… Mom and I are waiting…”

Paul follows the voice, parts the bushes and…

{{SCP-939-98 has been contained. The body of Paul Lee has been recovered.   Bite marks across his body indicate that he fell prey to 939’s vocal mimicry. A cover-up story has been given. Laura now believes that Paul Lee died in the crash due to the fire. }}</textarea></pre>
