&gt; He came up to tell me. William and Marie dug up Evan&#39;s body, took the life raft, and left. We&#39;re alone. On the upside, this means more food for us... I&#39;m still hoping someone will come along and find us here. I want to know more about who owns this place, why it&#39;s so strange. Is the cliff really some sort of pier? Or is it something stranger?

//**Researcher&#39;s Note:** Document 1057-E-Stephen was discovered in the upper floor bedroom of a beachside rental home on the peninsula at[REDACTED]. The site was brought to the attention of the Foundation by a caretaker, who arrived to mow the lawn to find a male corpse, minus the legs and with the arms removed just below the elbows, lying in the middle of the driveway. Study of this document as well as [REDACTED]dentifies the body as Timothy Zwicky, who has been missing since the loss of ████████ flight ████ out of San Diego in March of ████. Neighbors report not seeing anyone enter or leave the house since the caretaker&#39;s last visit. Note that the house is not, nor has it ever been, located on an island. The &#34;cliff&#34; described in this account does not exist.//

//The body of a woman identified as Marjory Vinnigio, also listed as missing following the disappearance of flight ███, was found in the house. Cause of death appears to be multiple gunshot wounds to the head and body.// 

//Of particular interest to the Foundation is the fact that no passenger named &#34;Stephen&#34; is listed on Flight ███&#39;s manifest. No other persons were found in the house, and the identity of this document&#39;s author is currently unknown.//

//Case 1057-E is open for all researchers with interest in contributing, to both evidence gathering and analysis. Personnel who wish to assist should contact doctor Vanheissen, and requisition documents 1057-E-Timothy, 1057-E-Ma[DATA EXPUNGED]//</textarea></pre>
