&gt; ------
&gt; Hi, i&#39;m relatively new to the forums, i always read them for entertainment and i really like horror stories even though i&#39;ve never been much of a believer in esoteric stuff and stuff. i wanted to ask for help or at least some advice for this situation i&#39;ve been dealing with these last few weeks. i already talked to people in different forums and chat pages like reddit but no one takes me seriously.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; a few weeks ago (about two weeks at least) i moved with my partner to a new home as we both got jobs in a city close to where i used to live and it was more comfortable for us to move together to a new home to start a new life as adults and blah blah blah blah.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; the thing is that as soon as we finished moving we decided to relax and have a barbecue in the backyard of the house. so far we had not had any problems, neither with the neighbors nor with the house itself. but still something felt out of place, i don&#39;t know. the vibes?? i don&#39;t quite understand how that works but my girlfriend mentioned it several times.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; to give you some context, our new home is located on the edge of a beautiful forest. close to the house there are also large parking lots and large green areas beyond the forest behind the house. basically it is our huge backyard shared with the neighborhood.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; the first few days living there we didn&#39;t have many problems since, well, at least i didn&#39;t often find myself at home. i am a doctor and we have been very busy lately.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; back on topic, my girlfriend told me several times that she found things out of the place where she left them. at first i thought it was because (probably) she was too proud to admit that she lost things or just forgot where she left them.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; or so i thought until it started to happen to me too. first with small things, the playstation joystick, the car keys or my socks for my slippers. then, it started to be bigger things and therefore annoying. a vase we had in the dining room changed places four times in one week.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; the televisions started to fail, the internet too. we called the service provider to complain and got them to send technicians to check what was going on. they told us that the electrical box had sulfated fuses and that they had already changed them. a few days later, everything started to fail again, same complaint, same procedure and //same problem//.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; all this wouldn&#39;t be much of a problem if it hadn&#39;t been for the fact that something horrible happened last night. We were getting ready to go to bed and we did our routine: we cleaned up, locked all the doors and turned off the lights downstairs (where the dining room, kitchen and so on were located).
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; we went upstairs, went to bed and i put on headphones with music to sleep. my girlfriend watched tv for a while until i fell asleep. after an hour or so, my girlfriend woke me up with a jolt. i took off the headphones and a little confused i asked her what was going on.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; she signaled me to be quiet and we stood still in the dark. i didn&#39;t quite understand what she meant, but just as i was about to complain i was interrupted by some banging. on the first floor there was a very, very loud banging, as if the front door was being kicked in or something.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; i immediately got up and asked my girlfriend to call the police. i put on a pair of pants and went downstairs to see what was going on. when i got to the stairs i found that the living room light was on. which was totally ridiculous because we always made sure everything was off, it was routine.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; standing on the stairs, i looked straight at the front door leading to the street. the knocking had stopped but i was still on the lookout for anything that might happen. i yelled to my girlfriend to come down and join me but she refused.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; i finished going downstairs to turn off the light in the living room and they started banging on the door again. like they were desperate to open it or something. i have no weapons, i had nothing to defend myself with so i grabbed a knife from the kitchen.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; i&#39;m not entirely sure about this part but i think it went something like this: i was about to turn off the light and when i approached the switch near the door i could hear someone turning the lock on the door, as if the lock was being removed.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; i got really scared, i&#39;m not the bravest person in the world but i still stood still waiting for something to happen.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; the door opened by itself after a few seconds. and nothing else.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; that moment was horrible and will probably be a trigger to move (again). i&#39;m very concerned about the safety of both of us so right now i&#39;m looking for another place in case something happens. these days i&#39;m going to change the locks on the house too. oh, the police never showed up.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; now, with the context. what do i do? i was told to talk to a priest because what happened is not normal, but i don&#39;t know how it all works. i was also told to put salt at the entrances of the house and to look for quartz stones to protect me from bad spirits. does anyone have information about that?

&gt; I&#39;m going to ignore the fact that there are no capital letters in your text, and I&#39;m going to think that everything you say is true. Have you already tried putting black or gray candles near the entrances to the home?
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; It is often said that salt is useful to keep out spirits and all bad energies, but it is not infallible and energetic charges involve more complicated things than just pouring salt in your home to keep them away.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; Regarding candles, they are capable of channeling certain energy in the same way that some minerals would do, citrine quartz necklaces are also useful.

&gt; Oh, thread about energies. One piece of advice I can give you is that you and your girlfriend should vibrate high. Good auras are always the pillar to avoid bad energies in and out of your daily life and home. :DDD

Why not? If he asks for help, it&#39;s probably because he needs it. If he is an ARG or something like that, he is the one wasting his time. It doesn&#39;t affect me at all, and it probably doesn&#39;t affect you either, otherwise you wouldn&#39;t be here.

&gt; I can only recommend that you get out of there urgently, seek help somewhere other than the internet. Perhaps a pastor at the nearest chapel might be of more help to you. Whatever you do, do it very carefully.
