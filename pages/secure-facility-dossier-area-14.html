Let&#39;s get some things out of the way right now.
 
First, I assume that you were sent here from someplace else. Despite what your new coworkers have told you, this isn&#39;t a punitive assignment. If people got sent here for screwing up, they&#39;d screw up here too, and we can&#39;t afford that. Whatever you think you did to deserve this, you didn&#39;t. That said, your coworkers weren&#39;t lying when they told you this was not a fun assignment. Nobody wants to live under a mountain in the middle of bumfuck-nowhere, especially not with the kind of neighbors we&#39;ve got over in heavy containment. But plenty of facilities have it worse, and I&#39;ve seen most of them. Don&#39;t let me catch you bitching unless you want to see them too.

Second, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard about the Bloody 90s. What you might not know is that I wasn&#39;t in charge of this place then. Lire was an inept coward who got his people, and my people, killed. I do things differently; specifically, I do everything I can to keep my soldiers - that&#39;s you, whether you carry a machine gun, a microscope, or a mop - alive. If that&#39;s going to work, though, you have to do your part. I run a tight ship, and I need a good crew to keep it afloat. If you can&#39;t handle that, be prepared to walk the plank.

]]

The access road leading to Area-14 is as wide and well-maintained as the terrain permits, to facilitate the travel of armored vehicles. Upon reaching the facility, the road splits into two forks: one that winds up the southern slope of Mount Abraxas, and one that descends into Sky Valley.

Sky Valley holds the barracks, armories, and training facilities of Armed Mobile Task Force Nu-7 (&#34;Hammer Down&#34;) and the region&#39;s Tactical Response Teams. The Sky Valley base doubles as a boot camp for new TRT and AMTF recruits. To protect operational security, access to this facility and more detailed information regarding it are granted only as strictly necessary.

The sole entrance to ABCA-14 proper is located on the south face of Mount Abraxas. It consists of an enormous, vertically-opening blast door emblazoned with the Area&#39;s insignia. This door&#39;s function is twofold: it constitutes an impenetrable barrier during lockdowns and, should all other measures fail, is strong enough to contain the force and fallout of the alpha warhead&#39;s detonation.

Beyond the blast door, a short tunnel leads to a parking garage. Due to space limitations, lower-ranking personnel are not permitted personal vehicles. If such personnel wish to leave the facility, a shuttle runs from Area-14 to the nearby town of Salem, NV at 18:00 on Friday evenings and departs from Salem at the same time on Sunday.

Beyond the parking garage lies the facility proper. Area-14 is divided into four levels, each of which is separated into three sections designated S, C, and N (for South, Central, and North, respectively). Strategically-placed blast doors allow each section to be sealed off from its neighbors if necessary.

[[=]]
+++ Level 1: Containment
[[/=]]

Level 1 is the oldest portion of Area-14. Much of it is still based on the preexisting ASCI construction.

++++ S1 - Residential Complex
This section houses all researchers, containment specialists, and other non-combatant personnel, as well as some security officers (overflow from the third-floor residences). Living quarters range from three-bedroom apartments to individual ones, with the latter allotted preferentially to higher-ranking personnel. Residential units consist of individual bedrooms, a living area, and a single bathroom. Large appliances (refrigerator, oven, dishwasher, washing machine, dryer) are not provided, as personnel are expected to take their meals from the mess hall and use the communal laundry facilities for their floor. Personnel may bring their own small appliances (minifridge, microwave, toaster, etc.) if desired.

The mess hall and communal recreation facilities (including a gym, billiards room, and small exercise pool) are also located in this section.

++++ C1 - Light Containment Zone

The ostensible primary function of this area is the containment of relatively non-threatening objects, mostly cooperative humanoids[[footnote]]Which are rarely permitted to exit their containment chambers, for security reasons.[[/footnote]] such as [[[SCP-326]]] and the rare Safe-class object like [[[SCP-5229]]]. Area-14 has few such objects, however, so the majority of C1 consists of office space for administration and non-medical staff.

[[include component:image-block
| name=tunnel
| caption=The cattle tunnel, or &#34;Moo Chute&#34;.
]]

Notably, C1 also includes a corral that, at capacity, can hold 28 head of cattle - a nine-week food supply for SCP-058 and SCP-165. These animals&#39; minimal care and feeding is handled primarily by Class D personnel. Cattle are not raised on site; instead, they are supplied by a commercial front (Sweeney Cattle Pastures) located in Salem. Since these animals are not intended for human consumption, Sweeney preferentially sends sickly, injured, or otherwise unfit specimens to Area-14. Cattle are transported to the corral from the parking garage by a passageway that does not intersect the residential complex.

++++ N1 - Heavy Containment Zone

Large-scale, dangerous, and/or hostile anomalies are contained in this section. The HCZ is continuously monitored by a security station therein and equipped with multiple automatic failsafes for a variety of breach scenarios.

The same passageway that connects the cattle corral to the parking garage extends through a set of security doors into this section of the facility, to facilitate feeding of SCP-058. The passage also contains a freight elevator, for the transportation of cattle to SCP-165&#39;s chamber on Level 2.

[[=]]
+++ Level 2: Biological
[[/=]]

The second floor houses Area-14&#39;s medical facilities. The layout of its sections, and the purposes thereof, mirror those of the first.

++++ S2 - Class D Housing

The southernmost section houses approximately 900 Category III and IV Class D personnel in conditions compliant with current [[[ethics-committee-class-d-housing-regulations |Class-D housing regulations]]], divided into six cellblocks of 150 each. These Class D personnel are primarily utilized as subjects for medical testing, though well-behaved subjects are instead enlisted for custodial work, care of the cattle, and other simple tasks of low risk and importance.

++++ C2 - Medical

Section C2 holds the laboratories and offices of medical personnel, as well as the Area infirmary. Large amounts of [[[SCP-4820]]]&#39;s blood, tissue, and organs are stored here, for the dual purposes of research and emergency medical treatment. Many of the Foundation&#39;s best surgeons are assigned to Area-14, to provide life-saving treatment for the severe and sometimes esoteric injuries often suffered by Nu-7 Agents and Tactical Response Officers. Due to its large complement of Class D personnel, Area-14 is also a frequent testing ground for experimental and/or anomalous surgical procedures.

Personnel suspected of anomalous contamination are not treated within C2. Instead, such personnel are quarantined in N2.

++++ N2 - Biohazard Containment

N2 contains the Area&#39;s biohazardous anomalies and, as such, is the most tightly secured portion of the facility. There are only two access points: an airlock connecting it to C2, and another at the top of the freight elevator from N1. N2 maintains a separate air supply from the rest of the facility to prevent spread of pathogens during a breach.

Most biohazardous objects are stored as isolated samples in a high-security freezer at the center of the area. This freezer is equipped with multiple automated security measures, redundant locking mechanisms, and remotely activatable decontamination systems to prevent a biohazardous breach. In extreme circumstances, the freezer can be remotely sterilized by thermal explosives.

[[include component:image-block
| name=operating
| caption=An operating room on Level 2.
]]

Other than the freezer, the majority of this section consists of laboratories, testing chambers for infected subjects, and facilities for the dissection, storage, and disposal of contaminated remains. There are also several small suites dedicated to the quarantine and treatment of Class E personnel.

S2 also includes two proper containment chambers, each connected to a heavily armed security station by a different 100-meter-long hallway. One hallway extends to the east and terminates at [[[SCP-1801]]]&#39;s containment chamber, where live subjects infected with the anomaly will be contained until it is successfully isolated outside a host. The other hallway leads westward, to [[[SCP-2068]]]&#39;s containment chamber.

[[=]]
+++ Level 3: Armed
[[/=]]

Level 3 is dedicated to the physical and informational security of Area-14. It is the most recently constructed section.

++++ S3: Security Housing

[[include component:image-block
| name=archives
| caption=A section of the archives.
]]

This barracks houses Area-14&#39;s large compliment of security officers. It contains similar amenities to the residential complex on Level 1.

++++ C3: Offices &amp; Training Facilities

This section includes an armory, firing range, and other training facilities, as well as the administrative offices of the security department. Most security officers do not have permanent offices here; instead, they are assigned to one of the numerous security stations on the lower floors.

++++ N3: Archives

Area-14&#39;s document archives are stored here. The archives cover most of the Area&#39;s history, including a few ASCI files that were recovered from the abandoned facility when the Foundation first claimed it. The vast majority of archival documents exist only as physical copies. Digitization efforts are ongoing, but the backlog increases daily.

[[=]]
+++ &#34;Basement&#34;: Power Plant
[[/=]]

Although the notion of a basement holds little meaning in an underground facility, the floor below Level 1 is nonetheless referred to as such by personnel who mostly live and work above it. The basement houses the small nuclear reactor that powers the facility. Typically, only staff directly involved in the power plant&#39;s operation are permitted access to it.

The Area&#39;s alpha warhead is also located on this floor. Should SCP-058 fully breach containment, or the integrity of the Area be otherwise compromised to an irretrievable degree, the exterior blast door will close, all other blast doors in the facility will open, and the warhead will detonate. The heat of the explosion will sterilize the facility, the force will collapse its internal structure, and the blast door will prevent any fallout from contaminating the surrounding area.

[[=]]
+++ Other Areas
[[/=]]

The description above does not include the smattering of crawlspaces, maintenance tunnels, and other nooks and crannies unlikely to be accessed by (and off-limits to) personnel not assigned to maintenance, containment engineering, and similar responsibilities.

The persistent rumors of undiscovered, sealed-off mine tunnels connected to the facility are false.

----
[[=]]
++ History
[[/=]]
----

The history of Armed Biological Containment Area-14 begins in 1881, with Melvin Windhand&#39;s discovery of gold on the slopes of Mount Abraxas. Windhand opened Clutch Mine soon thereafter. Less than a year later, miners unearthed [[[SCP-7587]]], attracting notice from the American Secure Containment Initiative. Mining continued under ASCI supervision until an unknown anomalous entity killed most of Sky Valley&#39;s residents, at which time the mine was fully seized by the ASCI and converted into a containment facility. It served this function until 1931, when a mass containment breach forced the facility&#39;s abandonment.

[[include component:image-block
| name=hallway
| caption=The only surviving image of Area-14 taken before its abandonment by the ASCI. Photograph depicts a hallway in the C1 area; further context unknown.
]]

Little else is known about Area-14&#39;s time as an ASCI facility or the aforementioned containment breach; most records of this period were either destroyed by the event itself or lost when the Containment Initiative disbanded, and those that remain are heavily redacted.

The abandoned facility first came to Foundation attention in 1979, when a severely injured mountain climber was found delirious in a nearby national forest, claiming to have been attacked by a &#34;man-eating ogre&#34;. Publicly, these claims were dismissed as the products of blood loss and dehydration, and the bite wounds attributed to a mountain lion. In reality, they seemed to have come from an abnormally oversized human.

Foundation forces investigated the claims and discovered that the object now designated [[[SCP-082]]] had made the facility its &#34;lair&#34;.[[footnote]]SCP-082 was presumably contained at this location by the ASCI, though it has been characteristically unhelpful when questioned about this matter.[[/footnote]] The object was accosting travelers nearby, demanding that they answer its riddle or be devoured. When force proved ineffective at suppressing or containing SCP-082, a specialist from the [[[department-of-mythology-and-folkloristics-hub |Department of Mythology and Folkloristics]]] was dispatched to meet the ogre&#39;s challenge. After answering Fernand&#39;s riddle successfully, the specialist challenged it to a further battle of wits, with the following terms: if SCP-082 lost, it would willingly enter containment. If it won, it would have the specialist&#39;s head. After seven hours, the specialist finally stumped SCP-082, and it reluctantly re-entered containment.

[[include component:image-block
| name=reagan
| caption=President Ronald Reagan and the Administrator at Area-14&#39;s official dedication ceremony.
]]

Due to the difficulties of transporting SCP-082 and the already-in-place (albeit somewhat outdated) containment infrastructure, efforts to recommission the facility as a containment Area immediately commenced. This work was briefly interrupted when the United States government, upon learning that the facility had been reclaimed, attempted to assert ownership of it. The validity of this claim was disputed; though all of the ASCI&#39;s assets were claimed by PENTAGRAM after the former&#39;s dissolution, the facility&#39;s abandonment prior to that time made the ASCI&#39;s claim to it, and thus that of PENTAGRAM, tenuous. The facility remained in limbo until February of 1981, when the recently-inaugurated President Ronald Reagan granted official ownership of the property to the Foundation as a show of good faith. Several rooms in the facility were later named in Reagan&#39;s honor.

Throughout the 80s, Area-14 focused on the containment of large, dangerous organisms similar to its first prisoner. [[[SCP-165]]] was one such organism (or group of such, in this case). Though the Area&#39;s inadequate (at the time) biohazard protocols led to several small-scale breaches of this object, the true need for a dedicated biohazard sector was not realized until the [[[SCP-940]]] incident. An improperly-trained Assistant Researcher left a sample of larvae outside of cold storage over his lunch break, which eventually led to the infection of multiple personnel by the parasitic spiders. Though most were successfully treated, one progressed to the final stages of infection more quickly than expected. The resulting footage of a walking corpse with twenty-four giant spider legs protruding from its abdomen was the only justification necessary for the construction of a dedicated pathological anomalies sector. The second floor was built for this purpose in the spring of 1989, and the facility renamed Biological Containment Area-14 accordingly. Director Xythinien retired soon thereafter, citing crippling arachnophobia, and was replaced by Dr. Amadeus Lire.

In the fall of 1990, [[[SCP-048]]]-N was unexpectedly terminated by [[[SCP-4205]]]. In hindsight, many personnel have identified this event as a bad omen. Though no causal relationship suspected, it cannot be denied that the &#34;Bloody 90s&#34; proved to be Area-14&#39;s darkest decade.

[[include component:image-block
| name=rubble
| caption=SCP-058 pinned under a destroyed building.
]]

It began in the fall of 1991. [[[SCP-939]]]-1 - the largest, oldest, and first contained instance - assaulted Dr. ██████ and [[[[reproduction-of-scp-939 |DATA EXPUNGED]]]]. At the same time, nine instances located at Bio-Containment and Research Site-06 demonstrated a previously undocumented ability to tolerate bright lights and began a cascading breach that culminated with [DATA EXPUNGED] [[[SCP-058]]] and the complete destruction of the facility. SCP-058 went on to demolish a nearby town and massacre its inhabitants before it was incapacitated and moved to provisional containment. Initially, the Foundation attempted to transfer SCP-058 to Armed Containment Site-03, as it was the most heavily armed facility at the time. The object was still en route to ACS-03 when it breached containment a second time, once again terminating multiple personnel and requiring incapacitation by AMTF Nu-7. To prevent further incidents of this nature, 058 was rerouted to the less equipped but much closer BCA-14. A third and final breach - the second-deadliest incident in Area-14&#39;s history - occurred immediately upon SCP-058&#39;s arrival, before it was finally placed in its current containment. This containment was far from secure; SCP-058 required near-constant suppression to prevent another incident. Only when consulting containment expert [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/folly Dr. Jean Karlyle Aktus] suggested that the object be provided with cattle on which to feed did the risk begin to abate.

Afterwards, Nu-7 commander Thomas MacLean decided to establish a permanent outpost for his task force in neighboring Sky Valley. This would allow the &#34;Hammer&#34; to come down quickly, if SCP-058 - which by this time had killed more than two dozen Nu-7 agents - were to escape again. However, the O5 council decided that additional precautions were necessary.

On December 31st, 1991, a nuclear failsafe was installed. Bio-Containment Area-14 had become Armed.

Over the following decade, Area-14 found itself filled with increasingly dangerous objects. The aforementioned loss of BRC Site-06, soon followed by that of [[[scp-296 |Armed Containment Site-03]]] itself, left the Foundation with few facilities capable of holding entities like SCP-058. As a result, most large, hostile anomalies were rerouted to ABCA-14, where they could be secured under the same nuclear umbrella. The extreme danger presented by these objects precluded much research, which was further hindered by the preferential allotment of budget to containment measures over laboratory equipment. Many of the less dangerous anomalies, as well as their assigned research staff, were accordingly relocated to the more technologically advanced [[[secure-facility-dossier-area-12 |Biological Research Area-12]]] or the more specialized Site-234. At the same time, Area-14&#39;s garrisons of Task Force Agents, Tactical Response Teams, and Security Officers rapidly expanded to account for the increasingly dangerous nature of its inventory. By the new millennium, 14 had become the Foundation facility with the highest ratio of fighting personnel to noncombatants, and one of the most heavily-armed overall. The crossing of this threshold coincided with the replacement of Dr. Lire as Area director by the retired Commander MacLean, a move supported by a substantial majority of Area-14&#39;s staff. The frequency and severity of containment breaches have decreased significantly since then.

We don&#39;t call SCP-058 the &#34;heart of darkness&#34; for the reason you think. It is a heart, and it is dark - evil, frightening, and so forth. But that would only make it a &#34;dark heart&#34;. We call it the &#34;heart of darkness&#34; because it&#39;s the dark heart of Area-14.

Before it came here, here was better. It was never a paradise, of course, but it felt less like purgatory. There were fewer guards, fewer guns. Fewer bloodstains. Fewer names on the plaque there in the lobby. That big blast door, the metal monolith, the mouth of the mountain, wasn&#39;t there yet. There weren&#39;t sick, starving cows waiting mindlessly for slaughter next door to my office. There wasn&#39;t a yarn-wrapped collage of pictures and poetry on the wall behind my desk.

But now? Now, this place is a prison. Not just for the monsters, not just for the D-class. Sure, we&#39;re allowed to leave, for the weekend. Some of us can even have cars. But where is there to go? Salem, the dried-up company town that the Foundation props up with its fronts? Salem, with its one-screen movie theater that never updated to digital, its dusty diner with day-old food and sluggish ceiling fans, its run-down love ranch where the kisses taste like amnestics? No, Salem&#39;s just a larger cell, with windows to the outside world that only make it feel further out of reach.

Sometimes I lay awake at night and dream of the nuclear failsafe. Sometimes on the edge of lucidity I think to myself that it will explode, that the maw of the mountain will slam shut for the last time and the belly of the beast will finally digest us all. Sometimes, when I&#39;m asleep on my feet, I wonder if Ronald Reagan gave us this place because he knew what it would do to us, what we would do to it. What would come to call this place home.

We don&#39;t know what those miners dug up. We don&#39;t know how many people it killed before the ASCI stuffed it back into its hole. We don&#39;t know why they crawled in after it. We don&#39;t know what killed the ASCI, or where it went after that. And we don&#39;t know where the heart of darkness came from, because the Council won&#39;t tell us. I wonder why that&#39;s a secret. I wonder how Site-06 was really destroyed. I wonder if the heart really had to be brought here. I wonder if I wish it hadn&#39;t.
