Maria Jones looked at the items collected before her. There wasn&#39;t much left of it. Obviously most of the personal effects in his office no longer existed, given the circumstances under which he...well, the circumstances that brought her here. David was a friend, and Maria was going to discharge a final obligation towards him. 

David Eskobar had no family to speak of, and few friends. He didn&#39;t particularly inspire friendship. It wasn&#39;t his fault, as much; he had had his stutter since childhood, and its severity was such that he never really opened up to many people. He and Maria had taken a liking to one another, perhaps mostly as two people who didn&#39;t have many other friends to speak of. Nothing romantic, mind you; she had always suspected David was gay, but ultimately was too shy to approach anyone of any sex. He lived alone, both in his dormitory and in his life in general.

Whether he died alone was unknown. Much of how he died was unknown.

Maria looked at the personal effects they shipped from the Site 38 dormitory. How it survived the bombing, nobody knew; it had certainly been hit, but the bomb failed to go off. Freak accident, they said. She would accept it.

&gt; One (1) collectible glass, reading &#34;Tennessee Aquarium -- Chattanooga&#34; with a tarnished image of a dolphin.
&gt; One (1) leather wallet, with assorted contents
&gt; Two (2) bottles Kaluha brand coffee liqueur, unopened
&gt; One (1) bottle Barton brand vodka, half empty
&gt; One (1) Amazon Kindle Fire, badly scratched
&gt; One (1) TV/DVD/VCR combination unit, heavily yellow stains (presumed nicotine)
&gt; Three (3) men&#39;s dress shirts
&gt; Four (4) men&#39;s dress pants
&gt; One (1) black men&#39;s blazer
&gt; One (1) handwritten note, text illegible except for final line: &#34;To My Love, Lisa&#34;

Maria paused. //Huh,// she thought. //Not gay after all.// She would look into who Lisa was, see if it was somebody who needed to be told of what had happened. She guessed not; David had never had a girlfriend or wife the entire time Maria had known him. Whoever Lisa was, she hadn&#39;t been around for some time. She sighed, a tear falling down her cheek. She clenched her fists, repeated a mantra to herself, and continued.

&gt; One (1) text manuscript, heavily edited (LEVEL 3 CLEARANCE REQUIRED)
&gt; Forty-nine (49) file folders (LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED)

As the director of RAISA, she had that clearance; the files were spread out before her. The files were his researcher notes from his time at the Foundation. She&#39;d be damned if she knew why he had a personal copy of his own files, let alone //hard// copies, but he was an odd one. She looked at the index before her:

//Like// hell //he didn&#39;t have a sense of humor,// Maria thought. The PFOEMA was a running joke between the two of them; David claimed keeping a neat personnel file was the only thing he did that his superiors liked. Maria always joshed back, but knew as well as he did that it was true. David simply wasn&#39;t made to work for the Foundation; he knew it, and his bosses knew it.

The manuscript was the text of his old personnel file, a story of how he came to join the Foundation. Again full of little in-jokes, he never really liked it as much. Maria guessed it was because it never made her laugh. 

[[collapsible show=&#34;It made her laugh this time.&#34; hide=&#34;And another tear came down.&#34;]]

&gt; **Name:** Researcher/Landscaper David Eskobar
&gt; 
&gt; **Security Clearance:** Level 3
&gt; 
&gt; **Duties:** Principal researcher for Group of Interest Alpha-388, &#34;Alexylva University,&#34; --assistant-- probationary director of Site 38, landscaping duties as needed
&gt; 
&gt; **History:** Mr. Eskobar was employed at Site 38 during a search for possible landscapers to maintain SCP-████ once it became apparent that D-class personnel often deliberately exposed themselves to its effects to avoid other duties. Mr. Eskobar was hired away from a private landscaping firm in ██████, Tennessee with offers of both increased compensation and superior benefits due to his experience in maintaining SCP-████&#39;s non-anomalous analogue, //Berberis canadensis.// Provisional Level 1 clearance granted.
&gt; 
&gt; 09/02/██: Massive containment breach at Site 38 leads to deaths of most personnel involved in containment of SCP-████.
&gt; 11/02/██: Mr. Eskobar reports to Site 38 in possession of SCP-████, delivering to appropriate authorities. Lacking any other practical option, Eskobar is promoted to Level 2 and given oversight of SCP-████ on the condition that he not request a pay increase.
&gt; ██/13/██: In light of continued good performance, Junior Researcher Eskobar promoted to Level 3, transferred to Site 19 for experimentation with [[[SCP-877]]].
&gt; ██/██/██: Incident 234-900 Tempest Night results in a massive containment breach at Site 19. Junior Researcher Eskobar --, like a goddamn idiot,-- [http://www.scp-wiki.net/game-day-1:smilers attempted to] --clusterfuck the Foundation-- initiate multiple containment breaches, planning to weaponize them for --self-aggrandizement-- containment purposes --, because that completely makes sense, asshole-- .
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;And that, Eskobar, is why I despise you.&#34; --Dr. Mackenzie
&gt; 
&gt; Researcher Eskobar experienced an attack by SCP-993 during the containment breach, only being recovered two days later, at the end of Site 19&#39;s primary security failure. Eskobar remanded to psychiatric care for █ months.
&gt; 12/02/██: Researcher Eskobar requests transfer back to Site 38. Transfer approved. Due to standing Foundation requirements, Researcher Eskobar was retained at Level 3 status at Site 38 only and placed over all Safe and Euclid-class objects related to GoI Alpha-388, then numbering █.
&gt; 11/08/██: Researcher Eskobar given position of provisional director of Site 38 due to retirement of the previous officeholder, with understanding that he is to retain job only so long as he can continue his preexisting responsibilities. Due to the low-priority status of Site 38, no replacement has been assigned to date.
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, Researcher Eskobar remains the only person --willing to trim that goddamn thornbush-- authorized for direct contact with SCP-████.

[[/collapsible]]

Maria never found out what the deal was with that goddamn thornbush. She asked David, but he always said he would tell her later. He said he had to keep some stories for their retirement. When they would drink together and talk about old times.

In blue pen, Maria included a small note beneath the rest of the entries on that list:

&gt; 03/12/12: Major [[[SCP-877]]] containment breach. Site 38 destroyed during containment efforts. No survivors recovered. David Eskobar missing and presumed dead.

The tears began to fall in earnest then.
