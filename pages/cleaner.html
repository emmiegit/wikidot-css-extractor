Date was… Dunno, January, &#39;05. Location&#39;s some nowhere town&#39;s edge in New York. Time around 6 o&#39;clock A.M.

Officer was writing up a ticket for the sixth illegally parked car in a row when they noticed a lotta footprints in the snow leading under a nearby bridge. Decided to take a look, found six kids. All of &#39;em just limp along the slope down to the river.

Backup arrived. Investigation started, a rookie detective happened to brush a kid. Witnesses report a snap, then down went the dick. Died instantly, snapped vertebrae.

Picked up the radio activity, called it in and drove over. Told &#39;em I was with the FBI, everyone needed to evacuate the scene. Backup arrived shortly. Scooped up each object into a containment box.

Standard procedure. Kids reported missing, detective KIA in a shooting accident, amnestics for the cops. Objects cataloged and shoved in storage.

Day after, got a letter on my desk. Opened it.

Told me they were the killer.

Told me how they lured every kid under that bridge before snapping their necks.

&#34;Like candies.&#34;

Closed it.

Tossed it in my shredder. Nothin&#39; since.

I clean messes up. I don&#39;t fuckin&#39; solve &#39;em.</textarea></pre>
