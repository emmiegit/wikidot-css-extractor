**Item #:** SCP-2963

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2963 is to be kept in two connected standard humanoid containment cells. Humidity of these cells is to be kept at 58%. SCP-2963-5 is to be fed once per day with liquid nutrient solution.

**Description:** SCP-2963 refers to 7 distinct entities that formerly comprised D-3553-3, a D-Class individual previously used by researchers assigned to SCP-████,[[footnote]]Powerful reality bender, considered neutralized as of 6/2/20██.[[/footnote]] under supervision of Dr. McCauley. D-3553-3 was converted into its current state during a failed containment attempt of SCP-████, which also resulted in the deaths of two additional D-class and four containment personnel.

Each entity grows and functions as a non-anomalous organ system would. SCP-2963-1, -2, -3, and -6 are able to speak in some capacity, despite lacking the necessary anatomy to do so. For records of such communications see sample interview logs.
||Item||Description||Notes||
||SCP-2963-1||Nervous System||Most communicative instance, possesses personality very similar to D-3553-3’s original personality. Able to locomote by pulling itself along horizontal surfaces, despite lacking necessary cell structure to do so. All nerve structures are intact and functional.||
||SCP-2963-2||Skeletal System||Communicates very rarely, but appears to possess intellect on par with SCP-2963-1 and -3. Bones are held together in form of human skeleton by unknown force.||
||SCP-2963-3||Muscular System||Possesses intellect on par with SCP-2963-1 and -2, communicates often. SCP-2963-3 is most prone to hostility and violence if provoked, and should be treated with caution. SCP-2963-3 typically maintains humanoid form, but is capable of moving as an amorphous mass.||
||SCP-2963-4||Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems||Moves in a similar fashion to SCP-2963-1, though it is able to scale sheer vertical surfaces. If SCP-2963-4 is deprived of oxygen, all 7 SCP-2963 entities will begin to suffocate.||
||SCP-2963-5||Digestive, Renal, and Excretory System||SCP-2963-5 does not move, and is not believed to be self-aware. Entity must be fed a liquid nutrient solution in order to maintain entirety of SCP-2963. All waste produced by SCP-2963 is excreted by SCP-2963-5. ||
||SCP-2963-6||Integumentary System[[footnote]]Skin, hair, and nails.[[/footnote]] ||SCP-2963-6 is capable of communication, though does so rarely. Entity floats approximately one meter above ground by unknown means, and is capable of maneuvering through very small gaps. SCP-2963’s containment chamber has been made airtight as a precaution.||
||SCP-2963-7||Reproductive, Endocrine, and Immune Systems||Entity moves similarly to terrestrial gastropods, with organs forming a foot to pull the instance forward.||

Below are sample interview transcripts with SCP-2963-1, -2, -3, and -6.
[[collapsible show=&#34;Interview SCP-2963-1-4&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]
&gt; **Foreword:** At time of interview, SCP-2963 had been in containment for 2 months. Interview conducted by Dr. McGann, Senior Researcher assigned to SCP-2963, formerly assigned to SCP-████ and thus familiar with SCP-2963
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Hello again, how are you this morning?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-1:** Well, I still look like overcooked spaghetti and share a room with my own intestines, so you know, the usual.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Right. We have a few more questions for you today, if you don’t mind.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-1:** Fire away.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** How much can you remember of your life prior to your current state?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-1:** You mean back when I was in one piece? All of it. Childhood, growing up, drug charges, other charges, death row, coming here, getting used like a lab-rat, and...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** And what?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-1:** And the kid. The bender kid.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** You mean ████?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-1:** Yeah. Mark. That was his name.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Right. How much do you remember of your time assigned to the ████ team?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-1:** A lot. They used us to deal with the kid. I guess they were afraid of him. But the other Ds didn’t talk much, but I got to know him pretty well. I liked him, good kid.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Until he tore your organs apart.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-1:** He was scared. What’s a kid supposed to do when armed goons come after him?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** They typically cry. He leveled a building.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-1:** An //empty// building! He wouldn’t have done it if there were people there!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** He killed six, and did this to you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-1:** Because they were holding a gun to his head! He was scared! He...he was just a kid. He didn’t know what he was doing
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Right. I think we can end here for now. Thank you for your cooperation.
&gt;

[[collapsible show=&#34;Interview SCP-2963-3-5&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]
&gt; **Foreword:** Interview conducted by Dr. McGann. SCP-2963 had been in containment for four months. Interview conducted through Plexiglas plate due to SCP-2963-3’s history of violence.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Good afternoon, three. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-3:** Aaron. Don’t use the number, I’m not a D anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** No, just a scp. 2963//-3//.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-3:** Use my damn name. You motherfuckers are the reason I got this way.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** No, that would be SC-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-3:** It’s not the kid’s fault. You can’t be mad at a bomb for going off. Especially if you planted it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Quaint. We have a few more questions for you, if you’ll cooperate.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-3:** Fire away.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Well as you know, we’ve determined that D-3553-3’s original personality was...fragmented by the incident that resulted in your creation.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-3:** That’s what you keep saying, yeah. I don’t buy it. I’m still me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Partially. As far as we can tell it’s -1 who got D-3553-3’s original personality. You’re close, but you display markedly higher aggression, host-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-3:** Maybe I’m aggressive because I’m a fucking meat-puppet! Because you sons of bitches made me this way! Because that judge had it in for me! Because the last 6 fucking years have been nothing but tests and labor and the inside of a cell! Because you killed the fucking kid, because you-
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Enough, -3.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-2963-3 throws itself at the glass, attempting to break through. During this, SCP-2963-3 screams unintelligibly.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Right, I think that’ll be it for today then. Thank you for your cooperation.
&gt;

[[collapsible show=&#34;Interview SCP-2963-2-2&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]
&gt; **Foreword:** Interview conducted by Dr. McGann, SCP-2963 had been in containment for five months. SCP-2963-2 requested an interview - request was granted as this was only the second attempt at communication -2 had made thus far.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Good evening, can I ask why you’ve asked for this interview?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-2:** I have information.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Okay, did you not have this information when we tried to interview you previously?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-2:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Why didn’t you tell us before?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-2:** I did not think it relevant.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Ok, what do you have to tell us?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-2:** I do not know who we are.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** We? You mean the rest of you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-2:** Yes. The Brain knows. The Muscle knows. I do not. The Skin does not. The others do not know enough to know anything.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Do you mean you possesses a separate memory from -1 and -3? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-2:** I do not remember living as the person we are.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** So your memories start after separation?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-2:** No.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** What? What do you remember?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-2:** I remember a life. A different life. The details are faded. I think it was a place far away.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** And you believe you and -6 came from this other person?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-2:** No. I did. The Skin is something else. From somewhere else. A shaper of flesh. A god-eater. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** I see. Do you have any idea why you were chosen for this? How you were pulled into D-3553-3&#39;s skeleton?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-2:** I believe we were tangent to this world. When the child was killed, it released an enormous amount of energy that tore through such barriers, and brought us here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Ah. Well this is a lot of information to process. Thank you for coming to us with this. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-2:** You’re welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt;
&gt; //Note: Research into the possible origins of SCP-2963-2’s and -6’s consciousnesses is ongoing.//

&gt; **Foreword:** Interview conducted by Dr. McGann, the day after Interview SCP-2963-2-2.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Hello, -6.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-6:** Please, call me Aaron.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Ah yes, your name, right?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-6:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Right. Tell me, Aaron, how much do you remember of your life before this?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-6:** I have told your people, I do not remember much. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Right, just double checking. What about Mark?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-6:** Who?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Mark. The kid?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-6:** I’m sorry, I don’t recall having any children.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** SCP-████
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-6:** Ah yes. The reality bender.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Yes. Do you have any idea why I requested this interview?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-6:** No. Is there something wrong?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Well it’s just that yesterday we spoke to -2 and he-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-6:** What did it say?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** He told us that you... aren’t D-3553-3.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-2963-6 remains silent//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** Well? Who are you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-6:** I am Aaron Doher-
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** No. Who are you, really?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-2963-6 remains silent for approximately 30 seconds//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-6:** This is my ordeal. It is as the Ozirmok said, “I have stepped beyond the Floe of Dreams”. I have entered this realm on my crawl towards apotheosis. I have been thrust unto this lowly form so that I may…no, //must// claw my way towards godhood. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. McGann:** I don’t...what are you talking about?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2963-6:** I am Zend Haôrath! Flayer of lovers! Render of suffering skin! And I have been brought here so that [REDACTED]

&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; //Note: It is currently believed that during the incident that created SCP-2963, SCP-████ pulled disparate consciousnesses from sources other than D-3553-3, and somehow pushed them into SCP-2963-2 and -6. Information regarding SCP-2963-6 has been forwarded to the Para-Religion Division. Neither SCP-2963-2 or SCP-2963-6 have been cooperative for further interviews.//
