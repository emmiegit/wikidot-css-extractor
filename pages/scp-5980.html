**Item #:** SCP-5980

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5980 is to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell at Site 83. SCP-5980 does not require sustenance. SCP-5980 is allowed outside of its containment cell once per day for two hours for recreational activities, but is strictly prohibited from entering the cafeteria. 

Food offered by SCP-5980 should be declined by personnel in order to maintain their mental health.

**Description:** SCP-5980 is the designation given to Ethan Chin, age 33. 

SCP-5980 is capable of perfect cellular regeneration and is, by definition, biologically immortal. Given the regenerative properties of SCP-5980&#39;s cells, research into utilizing SCP-5980 for medicinal treatment is currently underway.

Extensive testing of samples taken from SCP-5980&#39;s body has revealed that its skin, as well as its organs, nerves, and fingernails, possess a flavour that is universally enjoyed by those that consume it. The flavor of SCP-5980 will vary depending on the consumer. SCP-5980 exhibits a pleasant aroma regardless of the seasoning it&#39;s cooked with.

SCP-5980 is amicable and will often encourage Foundation personnel to &#34;have a bite&#34; of it when they pass by. It is important to note that SCP-5980 does not exhibit any  cognitohazardous properties.

Consumption of SCP-5980, while safe, is often detrimental to a subject&#39;s mental health. 

**Discovery:**

SCP-5980 was discovered after several complaints were made in an establishment called Cannibal Chin&#39;s in northern New Jersey. A food critic claimed to have witnessed SCP-5980 remove its fingers with a kitchen knife before deep-frying them. These were later served as french fries. Several other civilians claimed to have caught glimpses of SCP-5980 self-mutilating in the kitchen moments before serving them food, and a Foundation investigation was instigated.

When questioned, SCP-5980 claimed to have no idea what it was doing wrong, and insisted that Foundation operatives have a complementary order off of the menu. Its requests were denied by all attending agents except for Agent ██████. Agent ██████, who was unaware of SCP-5980&#39;s anomalous properties, consumed the entirety of an order of fries, sized large, dipping each fry in a dark green milkshake. Agent ██████ was psychologically evaluated and later requested an amnestic, and for his name to be expunged from the official record.

SCP-5980 willingly came into Foundation custody once apprehended.

&gt; Cannibal Chin&#39;s was shut down using [[[SCP-4670|Cover Story 14 (&#34;Health and Safety Violation&#34;)]]] after four years of continuous operation.

**Interview 5980.4:**

&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Owen Andrews
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewee:** SCP-5980
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Andrews:** Tell me again what you were doing at the restaurant.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5980:** Growing food gets expensive, like, the costs was wayyy too steep man. I wish it &#39;didn&#39;t have to be that way, but when life gives ya lemons.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Andrews:** Right, of course.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5980:** Didja try the Finger Fries?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Andrews:** I&#39;m afraid not.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-5980 holds out a finger.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5980:** Tastes jus like chicken, I swear. Mmm mmm mmm! Have a bite, it doesn&#39;t hurt.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Andrews:** Umm... Noo... Thanks? I had something to eat already.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5980:** Suit yourself, man. You&#39;re missing out.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Andrews:** How exactly did you make the items on the menu?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5980:** Oh, that&#39;s easy. I crank up the heat real high if the water&#39;s running low, and I keep all my [[[SCP-5918|spare meat n&#39; shit]]] in the cooler. God, I think I&#39;d die if I made every order at once.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Andrews:** And what did people say to you when they found out that //you// were the source of their meals?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5980:** Eh, forget about it. I didn&#39;t do nothing wrong. They&#39;re just a bunch of unappreciative bastards is all.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Andrews:** That&#39;ll be all for now.
