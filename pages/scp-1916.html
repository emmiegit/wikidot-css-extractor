**Item #:** SCP-1916

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All known instances of SCP-1916 are to be stored in a sealed crate in the secure warehouse at Site 85. Prominent signage is to be placed on and inside the crate indicating that SCP-1916 is non-edible. Mobile Task Force Xi-1964 (Slugworth&#39;s Sizzlers) are to monitor distributors and vendors of confections and confiscate any instances of SCP-1916 found in circulation.

All testing of SCP-1916 is to be conducted on D-class personnel who have been implanted with subdermal tracking devices. Outdoors testing is authorized at the remote facility adjacent to Site 85; in the event that an affected D-class breaches containment, use of surface-to-air weaponry to neutralize the test subject is authorized. Pending a full review of the results of Experiment 1916-6-1, all testing on SCP-1916-6 is prohibited.

**Description:** An instance of SCP-1916 consists of six hard sugar confections of the type commonly referred to as &#34;jawbreakers&#34; or &#34;gobstoppers&#34;, designated SCP-1916-1 through SCP-1916-6. Chemical analysis indicates that SCP-1916 are primarily composed of sugar and trace amounts of common food additives and colorings, as well as significant quantities of [REDACTED]. Each individual candy is spherical, measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter, and is brightly colored in a distinct pattern as follows:

* SCP-1916-1 is a uniform shade of bright red.
* SCP-1916-2 is colored a light beige with whitish streaks.
* SCP-1916-3 is white with several darker sections arranged in a pattern resembling the Earth&#39;s moon.
* SCP-1916-4 possesses several horizontal streaks colored orange and white, with several small white and red spots, including a single large red spot.
* SCP-1916-5 is a uniform shade of black.
* SCP-1916-6 is a uniform shade of black with a large white question mark printed across one side.

SCP-1916&#39;s anomalous effects manifest when an individual candy is consumed by a human being. Within 10-20 minutes of consumption, the individual&#39;s weight will increase or decrease by a fixed percentage based on which candy the subject has consumed. No physical change in the subject&#39;s size or mass has been observed in conjunction with this effect; the means by which SCP-1916 produces this effect is not currently understood. The subject will function as though the gravitational field of their current environment has been significantly altered; subjects testing SCP-1916 have in certain instances demonstrated an ability to jump or carry well in excess of normal human ability, and in several instances have proven able to escape Earth&#39;s gravitational field entirely as the result of their own physical ability. This effect lasts for approximately 90 minutes before gradually dissipating. Test subjects who survive the effects of SCP-1916 show no indications of long-term illness. Additional effects have been associated with particular candies; refer to Experiment Log 1916 for details.

At present, the Foundation is in possession of 738 unique instances of SCP-1916, each identical in packaging and composition. Each instance of SCP-1916 is individually wrapped and contained in a cardboard box measuring approximately 20 cm x 30 cm x 6 cm, with the individual candies held in a plastic tray within the box. The front face of the box features a stylized image of a child wearing a transparent glass helmet over his head and riding on the back of a Saturn rocket in outer space, emblazoned with the product name &#34;DR. WONDERTAINMENT&#39;S ZERO-GEE-WHIZ! MOON ROCKS™&#34;. The following text is printed on the rear side of SCP-1916&#39;s packaging;
