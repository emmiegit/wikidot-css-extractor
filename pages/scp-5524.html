**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to worldwide saturation of non-anomalous memetic effects, civilian cases of SCP-5524 do not threaten the Veil. 

Memetic inoculation before the fact is known to lessen the severity of SCP-5524 cases, but does not fully prevent the effects from taking hold. Cases of SCP-5524 infection within the Foundation may be treated after the fact via BRAINWORM Protocol.

Personnel intentionally transmitting SCP-5524 to their colleagues will be subject to disciplinary procedures.

Detainees believed to be members of [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5054-ex GoI-5054] (the //giftschreiber//) may only be interviewed by the Memetics and Countermemetics Section of [http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Site-43].

**Description:** SCP-5524 is a contagious memetic effect in two parts, resembling a human given name and surname. Individuals encountering SCP-5524 without possessing a Cognitive Resistance Value in the top tenth percentile will be unable to recognize it as a cognitohazard, and will exhibit compulsive effects including but not limited to:

* Repeating SCP-5524 out loud;
* Sharing SCP-5524 with others;
* Intrusive thoughts related to SCP-5524;
* A progressive inability to focus on anything except for SCP-5524.

The obvious secondary effects of this phenomenon are severely reduced productivity, severely increased mental fatigue, irritability and poor morale.

There is at present no means of determining whether SCP-5524&#39;s anomalous effects are an element of baseline reality, or a deliberately-cultivated effect.

The remainder of this file contains an uncensored cognitohazard. Even with memetic inoculation, negative cognitive effects are likely to persist after reading. Proceed at your own risk.

**Addendum 5524-1, Phenomenological Overview:** The SCP Foundation first encountered SCP-5524 on 15 February 2021 in the aftermath of a Mobile Task Force raid in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States of America. Three individuals believed to be engaged in occult activity were captured in this raid, and were subsequently interrogated at Site-43. Two refused to divulge their identities; the third was more forthcoming.

**Interview Log**

**Date:** 02/15/2021

**Investigating Officer:** Dr. W. Wettle (Research and Experimentation Section)

----

//[Excerpt begins.]//

**Dr. Wettle:** Let&#39;s start with something easy. Your friends won&#39;t even tell me their names. Maybe y—

**PoI-5524-1:** Brury Regevoy.

//[Silence on recording.]//

**Dr. Wettle:** What?

**PoI-5524-1:** Brury Regevoy.

**Dr. Wettle:** That&#39;s your... that&#39;s your name?

//[Dr. Wettle bursts into laughter.]//

**Dr. Wettle:** That is the stupidest name I have ever heard, and my name is William Wettle. Is that what you were doing at your gathering? Trying to magically fix your stupid names? Was it a stupid names convention? Brury Regevoy.

**PoI-5524-1:** I&#39;m very sorry.

**Dr. Wettle:** What, you&#39;re sorry your name is Brury Regevoy? I would be too.

**PoI-5524-1:** No, I&#39;m sorry for telling you.

**Dr. Wettle:** Don&#39;t be sorry for telling me! I&#39;m going to tell //everyone,// and they&#39;re going to love it. Brury Regevoy. Seriously.

**PoI-5524-1:** Good luck with that.

**Dr. Wettle:** Now, let&#39;s get down to brass tacks. You&#39;re going to tell me...

//[Dr. Wettle looks away, thoughtfully.]//

**PoI-5524-1:** ...yeah, good luck with that.

//[Excerpt ends.]//
[[/div]]

No further information was gleaned from this interview, and Dr. Wettle attempted to present his findings at the All-Sections weekly briefing. He was unable to provide any useful information about PoI-5524-1 or his organization, but did engage his colleagues in a spirited conversation about the name &#34;Brury Regevoy.&#34; Security camera footage subsequently captured the following scenes across the Site over the course of the following day.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
//[Drs. M. Bradbury and H. Blank are conversing in their shared research office.]//

**Dr. Blank:** I&#39;m serious! Brury Regevoy.

**Dr. Bradbury:** Brooooooreeeee.

**Dr. Blank:** RRRRRRRRREG-A-VOYYYY!

//[Both laugh.]//

**Dr. Blank:** What the fuck were we doing?
[[/div]]

----

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
//[Site Director A. McInnis is reviewing files at his office desk. He picks up a sheet of paper, and frowns. He can be seen mouthing the words &#34;Brury Regevoy.&#34; He shrugs, and returns the sheet to its stack.]//

//[Director McInnis continues his paperwork for the next twenty minutes, periodically retrieving the sheet of paper he consulted earlier and reading it again. He continues to mouth &#34;Brury Regevoy&#34; at regular intervals, frowning with increasingly evident displeasure.]//

//[Director McInnis spends the next twenty minutes staring into space. His mouth is working, but he appears to be fighting the urge to actually open it.]//

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
//[Chief A. Torosyan and Technician [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5056 P. Deering] are conversing over dinner in their shared quarters.]//

**Chief Torosyan:** Brury Regevoy.

**Deering:** Brury Regevoy.

**Chief Torosyan:** Rear Admiral Brury Regevoy.

**Deering:** Here comes Brury Regevoy.

**Chief Torosyan:** Ladies and gentlemen: Brury Regevoy!

**Deering:** Jedi Master Brury Regevoy.

**Chief Torosyan:** I&#39;m going to throw up.

//[Dr. Lillian Lillihammer is sitting in her office in the Memetics and Countermemetics Section. She receives a call at her terminal, and answers it.]//

**Dr. Lillihammer:** What?

**Dr. Wettle:** Brury Regevoy!

**Dr. Lillihammer:** ...what?

**Dr. Wettle:** You missed the briefing! Brury Regevoy. I interviewed a guy named Brury Regevoy.

**Dr. Lillihammer:** You don&#39;t need to tell me every time you do something, Willie. Whole days pass where I don&#39;t need confirmation that you&#39;re still alive.

//[Dr. Lillihammer suddenly frowns.]//

**Dr. Wettle:** Ah, here it goes.

**Dr. Lillihammer:** You imbecile.

**Dr. Wettle:** What?

//[Dr. Lillihammer shuts off the call, and walks out of her office. She enters the cognitive decontamination tunnel separating M&amp;C from the remainder of the Site, and taps several commands into a panel next to the door. Over the course of the next ten minutes Dr. Lillihammer observes a series of glowing symbols on the walls, floor and ceiling in precise sequence, listens to several overlaid audio files, engages in deep breathing exercises and subjects herself to flashing lights. She then returns to her office, and issues a Site-wide alert from her terminal.]//
[[/div]]
----

**Addendum 5524-2, Aftermath:** Within one hour Dr. Lillihammer had successfully developed memetic inoculants for SCP-5524, retroactively classified as BRAINWORM Protocol, and disseminated the relevant materials to all Site personnel. PoI-5524-1 and his two partners were remanded to Site-06-3 for permanent detainment, their speech henceforth considered a Class-A cognitohazard.

Dr. Blank consulted with PoI-382, Foundation-allied memeticist [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5382 Thilo Zwist]. PoI-382 confirmed that the three individuals captured in the raid were //giftschreiber//, memeticists opposed to the SCP Foundation&#39;s stabilization of consensus normalcy. Investigation into their motives for attacking Site-43 is ongoing.

----

**Addendum 5524-3, Subsequent Activity:** The recovery of another //giftschreiber// agent on 19 February 2021 exposed Dr. Lillihammer to what may have been a second instance of SCP-5524. Whether because of prior exposure to &#34;Brury Regevoy,&#34; because of an inherent flaw in this new instance&#39;s memetic makeup, or because the name was not actually cognitohazardous, &#34;Mezza Succepsim&#34; failed to provoke an equivalent crisis at Site-43.

Individuals infected with SCP-5524 must immediately carry out the following instructions in full:

[[f&gt;image MC.png]]
* SUBVERT -- Recite the following non-anomalous names ten times each to undermine SCP-5524&#39;s memetic effectiveness: &#34;Spudge M&#39;Gursky,&#34; &#34;Gibble Gobblegar,&#34; &#34;Spuzz Frumpkin&#34;;
* CLEAR -- Listen to one of the following pieces of music in its entirety as a mental &#34;palate cleanse&#34;: the theme to //DuckTales// (Mark Mueller, 1986), &#34;Witch Doctor&#34; (Cartoons, 1998), or &#34;[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2011-ex Temporary Secretary]&#34; (Paul McCartney, 1980);
* PREVENT -- Repeat aloud any or all of the following non-anomalous words to prevent SCP-5524 relapse: &#34;Jabberwocky,&#34; &#34;Iditarod,&#34; &#34;Shawinigan.&#34;
