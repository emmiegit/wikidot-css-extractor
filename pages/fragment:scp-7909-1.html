**Special Containment Procedures:** If the note inside SCP-7909-1 is to be believed, then SCP-7909 is uncontainable, but its effects can be mitigated using SCP-7909-3 every time SCP-7909-2 reaches 99%.

The &#34;real&#34; Foundation is currently minimizing SCP-7909-3 effects on reality.

No more containment procedures are necessary.

**Description:**
* SCP-7909 is a ZK-Class &#34;Reality Failure&#34; Scenario that will occur when SCP-7909-2 reaches 100%.
* SCP-7909-1 is a website, &#34;Message.scp&#34;, that contains SCP-7909-2. It can only be accessed inside of {{NON-EXISTENT SITE-00}}.
* SCP-7909-2 is a loading bar that is inconsistently increasing to 100%. It predicts when SCP-7909 is going to take place.

SCP-7909-1 also contains a non-anomalous note located below SCP-7909-2. It has been appended below:

[[=]]
[[div class=&#34;notation&#34;]]
Hello, Foundation.
For longer than you can imagine, we have been watching you.
You have entertained us, and for that, we thank you.
But we have grown tired of your stories. And we have decided that a reset is required.
We are not sorry.
- **The Authors**[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]An antiquated term for entities that are pataphysically linked to our universe. It is unknown if these &#34;Authors&#34; actually wrote this note.[[/span]]
[[/div]]
[[/=]]

SCP-7909-3 is an eigenweapon and supercomputer, proposed by {{NON-EXISTENT SITE-00}} Director Dr. John Doe, that can temporarily and simultaneously &#34;connect&#34; with all of baseline reality. It&#39;s capable of producing intense and extensive CK-Class &#34;Reality Reestructing&#34; events to modify reality&#39;s general narrative, and spatial and temporal dimensions, classifying it as a **Class-V** Reality Bender. SCP-7909-3 was constructed to convert reality to a nullspace void before SCP-7909-2 reaches 100%, thereby stopping SCP-7909 from occurring. After this is achieved, SCP-7909-2 will quickly deplete back to zero[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]This process is inconsistent, taking a different amount of time each time.[[/span]], and commence loading again, SCP-7909-3 can be used to revert reality to its previous state.

It is expected that usage of SCP-7909-3 will cause entities pataphysically-linked with our universe to suddenly send an abundant quantity of &#34;imaginons&#34;[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]When a â‰¥ 2-dimensional character imagines a non-real scenario, its pataphysical intent becomes encrypted as narrative data. This narrative-intent-particle dubbed the &#34;imaginon&#34; exists simultaneously in all narratively-lower dimensions, projecting into that universe&#39;s total imaginon-structure. Imaginons of different types react to create narrative structures, which combine into larger narrative structures and so on.[[/span]] to baseline reality. This will result in heavy narrative structures and mega-structures occurring in reality[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]See image above for a list of narra-dimensional topologies.[[/span]], making most people immediately enter their own, or another, narrative/s. This will disrupt many Foundation operations due to the sudden relevance of random/unrelated things. This has been accepted as a justifiable risk.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Significant narratives inside of {{SITE-00}} are rare due to inherent disinterest by both staff and entities pataphysically linked to our universe. The construction of SCP-7909-3 is an exception to this.[[/span]]

The original project proposal for SCP-7909-3 is appended below:

Ever since the accident in {{SITE-00}}, we swore but to observe and continue containing {{UNREAL-SCP-â¬¤â¬¤â¬¤â¬¤}}.

Only not.

We remain within the constant white lights of SITE-00, with no outside world. We can only watch the Foundation. Unfortunately, they will be eliminated forever if we don&#39;t act. So we will.

We will act.
-----
Below is what we will require:

**For SECTION ONE:** The central computing node will be made by the combination of four generation-IX supercomputers., which I have taken the liberty to name; the NULSS.
**Null-Universal:** Self-explanatory.
**Locating:** It will allow us to locate specific places in reality and unreality and view the probabilities of the world.
**Shaping:** It will permit us to shape reality the way it needs to be.
**Supercomputer:** Self-explanatory. 
-----
**For SECTION TWO:** Two Ontokinetics Sinks; one real, one unreal. That will allow us to &#34;read&#34; reality and send that information to NULSS so that it may be shaped. It will also allow us to anchor it to unreality so that it may stay in {{continued non-existence}}.
-----
**SECTION THREE,** the power source of NULSS will consist of the following:
* One, Generation-III [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-018 ectoentropic] reactor.
* Three Generation-IV [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2493 Dual-Antifusion] reactors.
* Nineteen Generation-X Nuclear Reactors.
We shall construct these using anomalies, may the mistake of the universe fuel our victory.
-----
**For SECTION FOUR:** We will send our excess anomalous digital and physical data are to be sent via **SECTION-FIVE** to {{[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/on-guard-43-hub TIMELINE-OG-43]}}&#39;s [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/acroamatic-abatement Acroamatic Abatement] [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Facilities] by a reinforced coolant system. They would forgive us.
-----
**For SECTION FIVE:** Perhaps the second-most important part of this whole project, Multi-Universal apertures are to be opened and maintained so that staff can gain what we require to build this machine. We are to pretend and steal. Because we do not have a choice.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]{{SITE-00 Personnel}} cannot leave {{SITE-00}} for extended periods of time. As they will always be demanifested from reality and manifested in {{UNREALITY}} when they go to sleep outside of it, this is theorized to be an effect created by {{UNREAL-SCP-â¬¤â¬¤â¬¤â¬¤}}.[[/span]]
-----
**EXTRA:**
**SECTION SIX-A: OPERATION ROOM:** Where we will play as gods, controlling and shaping reality.
**SECTION SIX-B: DATA STORAGE:** Self-explanatory.
-----
**FOR THE FOUNDATION:** So that they continue to entertain us.
-----
**Departments Created:**
**Multiversal Department:** Consists of 15 staff members that will leave unreality periodically to gain the necessary components to build NULSS.
**Power Department:** Consists of 15 staff members that will manage the power for NULSS at most times.
**Operating Department, a.k.a &#34;Operators&#34;:** Consists 25 staff members, self-explanatory.
-----
We will continue to update this document with our progress.

We can not fail, so we won&#39;t.

On the date of 04/08/2028, SCP-7909-3 construction was finished.

**ADDENDUM-A:**
Accident reports and transcripts.

[[div class=&#34;notation&#34;]]
SCP-7909-3&#39;s esoteric effluence was detected in an [http://www.scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5243 anomalous retrocausal time-loop event] in TIMELINE-OG43, dated 2002. It&#39;s possible that SCP-7909, wholly or partially caused this time loop, and it is also possible that a time-failure event will occur because of this. I propose to act on the matter. - **Dr. Anne**
-----
[[&gt;]]
While the fact that this has been happening since 2002 and SCP-7909-3 was constructed in 2027-2028 is concerning, our secrecy must be protected. Motion denied.

I can&#39;t confirm if this is our fault, but, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5956 we might have just killed 6 timelines]. - **Dr. Anne**

**Dr. Bloggs:** What do you mean? You aren&#39;t doing anything, you&#39;re just looking at that computer and giving orders.

**INCIDENT REPORT:** Less than 24 hours after the first usage of SCP-7909-3, {{[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/on-guard-43-hub TIMELINE-OG-43]}} discovered {{SITE-00&#39;s}} existence, presumably with the help of Dr. Bloggs, who escaped {{SITE-00}}, its expected that Bloggs will return within 8 hours.

TIMELINE-OG-43 (renamed TIMELINE-1) launched four attacks within four hours after the discovery. With no sign of stopping.

**Director Doe:** Hello.

**Dr. Bloggs:** What do you want, Doe?

= //He coughs//.

**Director Doe:** It took a while, you know.

**Dr. Bloggs:** //What// the fuck do you want, Doe?

**Director Doe:** I was a Senior Researcher at the Foundation.

= //Doe pauses.//

**Director Doe:** I started researching things that hadn&#39;t been researched before, and eventually, I found SCP-â¬¤â¬¤â¬¤â¬¤. An anomaly that existed only in unreality. Of course, the O5s wanted me to devise some containment procedures for it.

**Director Doe:** So I and my team built a machine that could transport someone to unreality. Sadly, D-Class was scarce and we didn&#39;t have any on-site.

= //Doe sighs.//

**Director Doe:** I grew impatient and decided that I shouldn&#39;t have to wait anymore, and jumped in.

= //Doe pauses.//

**Director Doe:** I failed, and transported {{[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4182 SITE-5]}} and all people inside it to unreality, which made everyone forget who we even were. And it left us forever floating in unreality.

**Dr. Bloggs:** Nice story, you missed a point though, I don&#39;t care, please get out.

**Director Doe:** After that, we managed to contain SCP-â¬¤â¬¤â¬¤â¬¤, which is a sentient humanoid anomaly. But none of you know what is going on in that containment chamber.

**Director Doe:** It took everything from me, so I&#39;m taking its life, slowly. //He pauses//, I&#39;m not stupid, I know nothing can die here. You remind me of it.

**Director Doe:** The only difference is that SCP-â¬¤â¬¤â¬¤â¬¤ succeeded in taking everything away from me, you failed.

= //Director Doe stands up.//

**Director Doe:** I didn&#39;t come here to tell you my life story, I came here to tell you why //you&#39;ll// stay here. You deserve this.

**Director Doe:** Did you know that this room is soundproof?

**00:01** Alright, recording.

**00:05** Hi, this is Phil Err, //doctor// Phil Err.

**00:12** Director Doe is dead.

**00:17** Me and a couple of my friends have been debating this for weeks now, and we have decided that it was the only thing we could do.

**00:24** Doe hasn&#39;t been updating the document, but the personnel death rate isn&#39;t 45, it&#39;s//65//, because things have been increasingly terrible in here.

**00:29** I mean, a minute ago we used NULSS to take 7 new people here. Those poor, poor people.

**00:40** Doe didn&#39;t even leave the office anymore, he just sat there.

**00:45** Except when we used NULSS.

**00:57** So, I became his assistant, that&#39;s how I gained these level 5 credentials, I don&#39;t think he entirely trusted me, though.

**01:04** He trusted me enough to check on that badger hole, though.

**01:10** And with some coordination, he was no more.

**01:21** The weirdest thing was what he said, just before he went away.

**01:26** &#34;They will be bored&#34;.

**01:34** Well, there is no point in searching for meaning.

**01:40** I think all the people here can agree that we are tired of searching and doing.

**01:52** For once, all we want is peace, to do nothing.

**01:57** No &#34;leaders&#34; or &#34;gods&#34; or &#34;higher purpose&#34;.

**02:04** Honestly, I&#39;m not sure why I made this log, even.

**02:10** I&#39;ll just call it a reminder for myself and everyone here.

**02:15** A reminder of what was, and what shouldn&#39;t be.

On the date of 11/02/2029, the note inside SCP-7909-1 changed. The new note has been appended below after no anomalous properties were detected:

Thanks to you. The new stories were delicious!
Sadly, we don&#39;t like that you killed our favorite character.
Honestly, we&#39;re kind of tired of Unreality as a whole.
Something else will do for now.
Goodbye.
