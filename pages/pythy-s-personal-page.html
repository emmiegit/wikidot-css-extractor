[[[Clunk]]] - 8/21/23

[[collapsible show=&#34;Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;Commentary&#34;]]
This is a tale about [[[SCP-087]]], The Stairwell, written from the perspective of a person being made to walk down the stairs. I wrote it as part of [[[Remixcon2023]]].

I wrote the character to be aware of what awaited them. Knowing that the crying girl couldn&#39;t be reached, knowing about the face in the darkness. And still terrified.

That being said, I didn&#39;t do the greatest job of writing it. The ending in particular, where the face appears and the character is terrified and runs, just kind of falls flat. I may try and rewrite it at some point after the contest is over. It might be downvoted, and I might need to delete this author page as a result. It&#39;s all part of the learning process.

[[[SCP-7885]]], Drifting Peace - 8/8/23
[[collapsible show=&#34;Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;Commentary&#34;]]
The SCP is intended to change how we thing about undead beings. Yes, she&#39;s alive past her death. Yes, she&#39;s animated by a force she does not understand, and send to wander towards an unknown location for unknown reasons. And yes, her body is falling apart.

But it&#39;s peaceful, to live through the end. To be parted from this mortal coil but still able to reflect. It&#39;s not heaven, not a blessing to strive for. It&#39;s not hell, not a curse to avoid. It&#39;s just the slow process of ceasing to be.

The piece tries to explore the way so much of our lives are shaped around &#34;I have to do this, so a bad thing won&#39;t happen.&#34; What if there were no more bad things left?

[[[SCP-5772]]], A Counterexample - 5/1/20
[[collapsible show=&#34;Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;Commentary&#34;]]
I wrote this SCP because I read several blog posts and papers written about the Navier-Stokes equation by Terry Tao, a top-flight mathematician and a very clear communicator. In [[[https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/finite-time-blowup-for-an-averaged-three-dimensional-navier-stokes-equation/ | one post and paper in particular]]], Terry constructs a variant of the Navier-Stokes equation which actually has solutions which blow up in finite time. In other words, if a fluid really did work according to this variant physical equation, energy would be concentrated arbitrarily densely in a finite period of time, until the physical model ceased to accurately model reality.

In this SCP, I tried to imagine what that scenario would look like, if it could actually happen in the real world. I definitely took that scenario in the most exciting and evocative direction, rather than the most realistic direction.

I was reminded of a quote to the effect that humanity is very lucky that nuclear bombs are incredibly difficult to create, requiring an extremely slow and/or expensive process to purify the necessary material. If we weren&#39;t that lucky, wars would look much, much worse. This piece asks the question: &#34;What if humanity isn&#39;t lucky - what if humanity just hasn&#39;t yet discovered how unlucky it is?&#34;

++ Other notes

I also contributed to the idea behind [[[SCP-2885]]]. My original version wasn&#39;t great, and it was downvoted and deleted. It was then rewritten into the version up today by [[*user Zyn]]. I&#39;m really honored that Zyn rewrote my piece into this excellent SCP, and really glad that some version of my idea persists today. Note that when I wrote my version, my account name was Dax_Symbiont. You can read my [[[http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/dax-symbiont | original version]]] if you&#39;re interested.</textarea></pre>
