SCP-7573
[[/div]]

**Item #:** SCP-7573

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Site-55 personnel are advised not to open any unmarked mail received from the Site&#39;s mailroom, with the exception of Researcher Arthur, the current SCP-7573 research lead.

**Description:** SCP-7573 is a series of letters manifesting within the Site-55 mailroom. Instances are always addressed to a member of staff with no return address. The contents of SCP-7573 will typically contain threats of physical violence against the addressee. When opened by the addressee, additional SCP-7573 instances will begin to manifest within their mailbox. If not opened, SCP-7573 manifestations cease after approximately four to five days, at which point the anomaly will target a new subject. An SCP-7573 instance opened by anyone other than the addressee will spontaneously combust, effectively destroying the message within.

**Addendum 7573.01:** Research Log

Researcher Arthur was instructed to keep opening any received SCP-7573 instances. At the time of writing, he is the only remaining SCP-7573 target. Attached is an abridged log of received SCP-7573 instances recreated by Researcher Arthur.

&gt; **SCP-7573 Manifestation #:** 1
&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** I&#39;m going to kick your ass, you fuckin poindexter. 

&gt; **SCP-7573 Manifestation #:** 5
&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** I hope you fall down a well and get stuck down there, crying &#39;Wah, I&#39;m stuck in a well, someone help me!&#39; But no one ever comes.

&gt; **SCP-7573 Manifestation #:** 14
&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** I ought to suffocate you, you little prick.

&gt; **SCP-7573 Manifestation #:** 35
&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** ███████████ , ███████████[[footnote]] Exact coordinates of Researcher Arthur&#39;s home redacted for privacy. [[/footnote]]

&gt; **SCP-7573 Manifestation #:** 52
&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** I&#39;m actually running out of threats here, but you know, I&#39;m starting to think you like this, you little weirdo. Do you like this, Arthur? Do you like it when I threaten you? Does that get your pathetic little rocks off?

&gt; **SCP-7573 Manifestation #:** 65
&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** I&#39;m surprised you&#39;ve made it this far. Most people give up after the first three days.

&gt; **SCP-7573 Manifestation #:** 77
&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** Hey, just so you know, I was only joking before. About all that stuff with the threats and whatnot. Are we cool? Just open the next letter if we&#39;re cool. 

&gt; **SCP-7573 Manifestation #:** 78
&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** Okay, good. Phew. I&#39;m glad we&#39;re cool. 

&gt; **SCP-7573 Manifestation #:** 89
&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is; I&#39;m just so flattered somebody would stick it out despite me being such a dick. You&#39;re more patient than anyone I&#39;ve ever known. Sorry for being so cruel to you. You didn&#39;t deserve that.

&gt; **SCP-7573 Manifestation #:** 97
&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** N/A
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** The SCP-7573 instance contained a single rose. It is unknown how the envelope was able to store the rose, as the object was significantly larger than its container and showed no signs of exterior distortion. 

&gt; **SCP-7573 Manifestation #:** 105
&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** You&#39;re the only person I can really talk to without fearing you&#39;ll abandon me. I know I acted very mean in the beginning but I guess I was just defending myself from being hurt again. I&#39;m sure you know how it feels to talk to someone only to have them ditch you. I&#39;m sorry about that.

&gt; **SCP-7573 Manifestation #:** 113
&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** Wanna hear something sad? You&#39;re probably the only friend I&#39;ve ever had. How pathetic is that? But you wouldn&#39;t laugh at me over that, I know you wouldn&#39;t. You&#39;re a good friend, Arthur.

&gt; **SCP-7573 Manifestation #:** 120
&gt; 
&gt; **Message:** I&#39;m glad we&#39;re friends. I&#39;m glad I have you, Arthur. Thanks for listening to me.

Due to the advent of email in 1978, snail mail fell out of favor as a means of intra-Site communications for the Foundation. For this reason, the Site-55 mailroom was demolished to make way for new SCiPNet servers. SCP-7573&#39;s final manifestation occurred on May 8th, 1979, one week prior to the demolition of the mailroom.
