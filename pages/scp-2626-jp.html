++ **Special Containment Procedures**

Due to SCP-262-IE&#39;s properties, containment is difficult; it is considered impossible to retrieve all instances of SCP-262-IE-1 in civilian society. Because of this, the current focus of containment is to prevent the spread of SCP-262-IE-2 in civilian society. Foundation owned webcrawler &#34;Morrison&#39;s Jig&#34; is to monitor the internet and remove content referencing SCP-262-IE (especially SCP-262-IE-2). Upon discovery of such content, the uploader is to be located and Mobile Task Force Éire-4 &#34;Foxhunter&#39;s Reel&#34; is to be dispatched to the location to administer amnestics and retrieve SCP-262-IE-1. All retrieved instances are to be contained in Low-Threat Object Lockers in Site-35369, and assigned personnel are to analyze them using SCP-262-IE-2.

++ **Description**

SCP-262-IE is the general term for directed [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology topological] changes that autonomously occur in elongated flexible objects when not directly observed. Elongated flexible objects that have undergone these changes are designated SCP-262-IE-1. 

SCP-262-IE usually occurs at least 5 hours after external observation is lost. These elongated flexible objects (in the case where both ends are taken to be closed) automatically form non-trivial knots (one object) or tangles (two objects or more). SCP-262-IE-1&#39;s [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(mathematics) knots] have been determined to increase in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_number_(knot_theory) crossing number] in proportion to the amount of time unobserved.

SCP-262-IE-2 is a method of extracting meaningful strings of text from SCP-262-IE-1 patterns. This method assigns a concept to each equivalent pattern in the knot, then decomposes SCP-262-IE-1 into prime knots and replaces each knot with its equivalent concept producing a sentence. 

SCP-262-IE-2 was initially established by Prof. Tuirtheacht Ó hEidirsceóil at the National University of Ireland, who published it as the result of research at a university presentation. When the Foundation confirmed SCP-262-IE as anomalous and began containment of the object, SCP-262-IE-2&#39;s full contents had not yet been clarified. As such, Prof. Ó hEidirsceóil and his sister Earraigh Ní Eidirsceóil, who had also been undertaking the research, were consulted and both are now employed by the Foundation to research SCP-262-IE-2. In addition, all participants present at the presentation were administered Class-A amnestics.

Information of SCP-262-IE-1 extracted via SCP-262-IE-2 generally relates to things the owners of or those related to SCP-262-IE-1 had forgotten or are only unconsciously aware of. Of note is that even memories removed using amnestics can be recalled via SCP-262-IE-1. As such, SCP-262-IE is a potential information leak, and can become a carrier for infohazards.

__**Interview log with Eidirsceóil siblings**__

The following is a record of an interview with the Eidirsceóil siblings during the initial stages of SCP-262-IE containment.

[Begin Recording]

**C:** Let&#39;s begin the interview. Tuirtheacht, Earraigh, could you tell me more about Code Sìdh[[footnote]]The name given to SCP-262-IE-2 by Ó hEidirsceóil.[[/footnote]]?

**T:** Of course. Well, we don&#39;t really have much to say. Well, I suppose it started like this - you&#39;ve probably experienced it before, like when you leave your headphones in your pocket and they tangle up, or when you want to untangle a ball of yarn you&#39;ve left out of sight for a while, but somehow can&#39;t.

**C:** Of course. In my case, there&#39;s a rule that says we have to wear our ID cards and pagers around our necks, but after a while the strap gets tangled and it&#39;s hard to untie it.

**E:** Our parents&#39; house was a workshop where people worked with [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BAg%C3%A1n súgán][[footnote]]Irish for straw-rope.[[/footnote]], and on rest days we&#39;d have a lot to help out with. Even so, we started to notice once we left some materials somewhere and we&#39;d come back to it all tangled, so that was how we started. And my brother taught topology in university... //(pauses for a moment)// Caoimhe, do you know what topology is?

**C:** //(shakes head)// ... Unfortunately, it&#39;s out of my specialization.

**T:** Topology is the study of &#34;properties that hold after continuous deformation&#34;. It sound complex, but I&#39;ll offer a simple example: a donut has one hole, and so it is topologically equivalent to a cup with a handle. Imagine the cup is made of unfired clay. If you push together the cup part and keep the handle, it looks like a weird-looking donut, doesn&#39;t it?

**E:** If I may offer an extreme example, the human body has the alimentary canal, which goes from the mouth to the anus, so it&#39;s also topologically equivalent to a donut.

**T:** Earraigh, how did you come up with that... well, it&#39;s roughly correct, anyway. Do you understand so far?

**C:** Yes, for the most part.

**T:** And in topology, there is a field that studies knots in rope. It&#39;s called [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory knot theory]. I&#39;ll leave out the details, but you can use this theory to determine &#34;which knots are topologically equivalent to one another&#34;.

**C:** Uh huh?

**T:** Here&#39;s the important part... when we&#39;d help out around the house, the súgán we left tended to knot up in a topologically equivalent manner. And most of them had a large crossing number. If I may offer an example, with a crossing number of 15, there are 250,000 possible patterns. It can&#39;t be a coincidence that multiple of these &#34;random&#34; knots have the same pattern.

**C:** And because of that drawing your interest, you started to research it?

**T:** Yes. Although, initially we had no idea what we were doing. With no prior information, it was like we were trying to decode Linear A. The fact we managed to decode it at all was honestly a coincidence. One day, Earraigh said she couldn&#39;t find her book of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._B._Yeats Yeats&#39;] works, and I came to help her find it.

**E:** It was a book I&#39;d loaned from the library, and I&#39;d just remembered it was overdue... so I hurried to find it. I couldn&#39;t find it in the study, or the room, so we looked for it all over the house. After a whole day, we found it in a corner of the basement...

**T:** Oh, at the time, she was called to carry a bag of flour up from the storage room in the basement. Earraigh was holding the book at the time, so she&#39;d probably left it there then... Anyway. After we&#39;d found what we were looking for, we went to the library to return the book, then went home. When we went into the workshop to continue deciphering the knots. And then... the knots that had all been different had now formed themselves into the same pattern.

**C:** The same pattern?

**T:** Yes. As I said earlier, the chances that the knots were forming the same pattern out of pure chance is close to impossible. Now that I think about it, it was around sunset, and it was starting to get dark. A crow on the roof cawed, like it was announcing something, and then flew away. And in the midst of all that, knots with the same face were spread out all over the floor. That must have been eerie, but somehow... I felt it was calling out to me. 

**C:** Calling out?

**T:** I can&#39;t put it into words, but... I had a feeling the knots, one by one, were calling out to me, trying to tell me something with all their might. I was crawling on the floor, scrawling a correspondence chart between the knots and sentences. A few days ago, the thoughts I&#39;d had when Earraigh read the book. A few years ago, when I&#39;d borrowed the same book from the library and read it. The sentences from the book that I&#39;d memorized and then forgotten. That&#39;s what they were trying to tell me, and I somehow realized it... and that&#39;s how we started decoding.

**C:** ... //(motioning for interviewees to continue)//

**T:** But we haven&#39;t decoded all of it. The correspondence chart we have only has a few tens of lines. Even then, knots forming on their own to express memories... it&#39;s very strange, and it might even it might exceed science and pass right into the realm of the occult. Perhaps it could be a prank of the [[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]fairies[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]Sìdhe[[/span]][[/span]].

**C:** In fact... there is an organization that has offered to support your research...

++ **Special Containment Procedures**

As this object is a core component of Project Kinea, a part of [[[*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/making-2000-hub |Project Arca]]], all information in this document has been designated Level 6/2000 clearance.

As SCP-262-IE-a instances cannot be interfered with normally, no special containment measures have been taken. In order to investigate SCP-262-IE-a instances, [[[*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-1970-jp| Hartmann]]]-Siochfhradha non-quantum interferometric spirit detectors are permitted to be used to examine the stored SCP-262-IE-1 instances. The relation of SCP-262-IE-a instances to [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/higashi-no-kamisama |various urban legends]]] is currently under investigation.

++ **Description**

SCP-262-IE is the general term for directed topological changes that autonomously occur in elongated flexible objects when not directly observed. The directionality of these changes manifest themselves primarily as a vector for returning personal thoughts to the noosphere[[footnote]]The collective sphere of thought of the human race. In this case, it refers to the collection of memories and knowledge amassed by the entire human race.[[/footnote]]. The action of SCP-262-IE can, for instance, return forgotten memories and knowledge. It is theorized that this phenomenon is a result of the storage properties of the noosphere.

SCP-262-IE-a are Class-प spirits[[footnote]]Spirit entities that can only be observed using non-interfering methods.[[/footnote]] theorized to be the source of SCP-262-IE. Based on observations using Hartmann-Siochfhradha non-quantum interferometric spirit detectors[[footnote]]Based on Hartmann spirit cameras, these devices indirectly observe spirits by excluding the object of observation from the observation range.[[/footnote]], SCP-262-IE-a typically emerge from humans or sapient organisms with similar intelligence to humans by a method similar to [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astral_projection astral projection]. SCP-262-IE-a entities can be thought of as a residual thought that possesses &#34;forgotten information&#34; and as such induces small topological changes in its environment to preserve its information. As elongated flexible objects are topologically manipulable, they are particularly susceptible to SCP-262-IE-a influence, and therefore attract such instances. Objects affected by SCP-262-IE-a in this manner are designated SCP-262-IE-1. 

SCP-262-IE usually occurs at least 5 hours after external observation is lost. These elongated flexible objects (in the case where both ends are taken to be closed) automatically form non-trivial knots (one object) or tangles (two objects or more). As the amount of time unobserved increases, SCP-262-IE-1&#39;s complexity and therefore the amount of stored information increases exponentially. Current experimental results show that a single SCP-262-IE-1 left for five days can store up to 2.6 GB of data.

SCP-262-IE-2 (commonly known as Code Sìdh) is a method for reinterpreting information encoded in SCP-262-IE-1 as a natural language. This method assigns a concept to each equivalent pattern in the knot, then decomposes SCP-262-IE-1 into prime knots and replaces each knot with its equivalent concept producing a sentence in natural language.

Project Kinea, which involves the creation of a large-scale high-speed recording medium using SCP-262-IE, is currently in proposal. This project is composed of two subprojects, &#34;Cuimhne&#34; and &#34;Caoineadh&#34; (both pronounced similarly to Kinea). The O5 Council is currently deliberating on whether or not to proceed. In addition, as Project Caoineadh involves ethical concerns, a parallel review by the Ethics Committee is also currently underway. For further information, please consult Addendum 262-IE.C-01 and Addendum 262-IE.C-02.

**Project #:** Arca-262-IE-C01 (&#34;[[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]Cuimhne[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]&#34;Memory&#34;[[/span]][[/span]]&#34;)

**Project Objective:** As part of Project Arca, in order to recreate human civilization following the imminent SD-Class &#34;Shutdown&#34; Scenario, a form of database storage for information relating to culture and technical skills is required. However, even if a large portion of the planned construction site is used, both standard and anomalous data storage devices are limited by storage capacity and write speed. As such, only extremely important information relating to civilization and technology are planned to be saved. As this information is incomplete, inconsistencies may arise that threaten the stability of the newly reconstructed civilization. For this reason, a method of storing all information about human civilization is desperately needed.

This project&#39;s goal is to use the noosphere&#39;s storage properties and the extension phenomenon that is SCP-262-IE as a form of storage for the Project Arca database, in order to create a lightweight but super-high-capacity rapid memory medium.

**Project Description:** This project is based on the following components:

**1. Carbon-Fiber Knot Induction Mechanism** (CODENAME: &#34;[[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]Casadh an tSúgáin[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]Tangled Thread[[/span]][[/span]]&#34;)

A device that uses thin strands of carbon fiber stored in a space with low topological stability as a storage medium. In order to lower the topological stability of the space, the runaway state of the pseudo-Riemannian manifold creation device planned to be used in Project Arca can also be used. Following this, SCP-262-IE-a instances are to be lured to the space in order to induce SCP-262-IE-1 in the carbon fiber strands.

**2. Ó hEidirsceóil-Type Knot Tabulator** (CODENAME: &#34;[[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]Amhrán Oisín[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]Song of Oisín[[/span]][[/span]]&#34;)

A device for identifying the knots that form in component 1. By inserting the carbon fiber into the probe needles in both directions, [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reidemeister_move Reidemeister moves] are used to determine the individual positional relationships between fibers. In order to improve the precision of the results, optical sensors and thaumaturgical equivalence resonance sensors are attached in addition to the probe needles.

**3. High-Speed Quantum Decryption Computer** (Codename: &#34;[[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]Cuimhne an Phíobaire[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]Piper&#39;s Memory[[/span]][[/span]]&#34;)

A system to convert patterns produced by component 2 into displayed readable information. In addition to the correspondence table for the already-determined Code Sìdh, an artificial intelligence conscript (AIC) may be packaged in order to decode previously unencountered patterns. Currently, out of all usable AICs, [*http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/author:benjaminchong Cradle_Novos.aic] has been tentatively selected for its ability to command multiple languages.

With the above components, at the end of Project Arca&#39;s 5-day warmup period (the time needed to set up [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2000 Bright/Zartion Hominid Replicators (BZHR)]), 73.5% of human civilization&#39;s accumulated cultural and technological information can be saved. However, in order to further increase the percentage of saved data, ensure the safe and stable operation of the above project, and create a redundant system for the main database, it is thought to be necessary to create in parallel Project Arca-262-IE-C02 (&#34;Caoineadh&#34;), described in a separate proposal.

**Project #:** Arca-262-IE-C02 (&#34;[[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]Caoineadh[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]&#34;Elegy&#34;[[/span]][[/span]]&#34;)

**Project Objective:** In order to increase the percentage of data stored in the devices proposed in Project Arca-262-IE-C01 (&#34;Cuimhne&#34;), and to ensure the stability of the device, __it is considered necessary to activate the Ennui Protocol prior to the occurrence of the SD-Class &#34;Shutdown&#34; Scenario.__ This is due to the fact that unless a large proportion of the human population loses memories or life, the above proposed device cannot function properly. However, as 80% of the amnestics that will be available to the Foundation at the estimated time of the SD-Class Scenario are reserved for the implementation of the Ennui Protocol after civilizational reconstruction, there is clearly not enough supply to use the Ennui Protocol twice.

The goal of this project is to procure sufficient amnestics to use the Ennui Protocol before the SD-Class &#34;Shutdown&#34; Scenario, or to develop alternate means of amnesticization.

**Project Description:** Currently, the main sources of amnestics known to the Foundation are [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3000 SCP-3000] and [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3171 SCP-3171]. Of those, the plan consists of somehow modifying SCP-3171 as a plant-based anomaly, and to convert it into a host for dispersing amnestics.

Currently, [[[*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/comeout-from-arca| the Japan Organisms Improvement and Creation Laboratory]]], which has been enlisted to assist in the creation of Project Arca, possess technology that can be used to achieve the aforementioned modifications. In addition, in the recent attack by the hostile group [[[*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/fixedflowers| Fixed Flowers]]], the [[[*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/early-summer-rain-on-arca| plant-based anomaly]]] used by the group has shown the ability to grow at rapid pace, and as such is considered of use to the project. The proposal thus includes raiding the organization and retrieving the relevant technology.

Considering these as the prerequisites, the following steps are to be taken to create a plant-based amnestic dispersal host in order to execute the Ennui Protocol:

**1. Dispersal of Seeds** (Phase &#34;[[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]Saoirse[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]Freedom[[/span]][[/span]]&#34;)

24 hours prior to the occurrence of the SD-Class &#34;Shutdown&#34; Scenario, seeds of the plant-based amnestic dispersal host are to be distributed to all areas of the earth and planted. In addition to dispersal by airplane and other standard means, use of [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-514 SCP-514] and similar anomalies can be considered for conflict zones. Since the time for development, growth and dispersal of these hosts is limited, the technologies used by the two aformentioned groups are to be used to shorten the growth time, and only outdoor areas will be considered.

**2. Drawing Out Targets** (Phase &#34;[[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]Samhradh[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]Summer[[/span]][[/span]]&#34;)

As the dispersal targets are limited to outdoor areas, after the seeds have grown, the subjects of amnesticization are to be drawn out to the areas where the seeds have grown. As such, the flowers of the plant-based amnestic dispersal host are to be made visually appealing, and are to carry a certain degree of memetic effect. In addition, [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lily-s-proposal some degree of weather control is to be added], in order to encourage the subjects to leave indoor areas and become exposed to the host.

**3. Amnesticization** (Phase &#34;[[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]Áthas[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]Joy[[/span]][[/span]]&#34;)

Following the drawing out of all subjects, the plant-based amnestic dispersal hosts are to begin scattering amnestics. In order to fully ensure the stable operation of Arca-262-IE-C01 (&#34;Cuimhne&#34;), __all memories and knowledge, save for basic instincts, shall be removed from the subjects.__ This constitutes an undignified end of humanity, and as such [[[*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/get-rid-of-the-veil| the Ethics Committee]]] must be consulted for approval.
