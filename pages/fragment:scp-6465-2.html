[[/div]]**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6465 is not to be directly addressed by any name, and is not to be made aware of its designation as SCP-6465.

SCP-6465 is to be housed in a large humanoid containment unit, painted with Euler Aspect-Limiting Runes^^[((bibcite euler))]^^, as well as the wards designed by the Wandsmen. The floor of Site-51 containing SCP-6465 is to be isolated from the rest of the Site. Personnel below Level 4 assigned to SCP-6465 are to be rotated in 1 month shifts and given Class C amnestics at the end of their station to expunge all information relating to SCP-6465, as to avoid an accidental breach.

Any mention of SCP-6465 or communication of specific information about it[[footnote]]Including but not limited to physical descriptions, its name, anomalous properties, location, etc.[[/footnote]] is only to be done in environments protected by Derichs-Lindberg Thaumic Exclusion Wards^^[((bibcite derichs))]^^. 

The SCP-6465 file itself is to be fitted with informational protection wards to allow for physical transfer between Sites where it is needed. Due to the sequential nature of digital transfers, this does not protect against a breach of SCP-6465 during network transfers, copying of the file from one storage medium to another, or even movement of data within a system to process or display it. Storage media containing the SCP-6465 file is only to be plugged in and accessed within one room fitted with TEWs.
[[div_ class=&#34;fancyhr&#34;]]

[[/div]]**Description:** SCP-6465 is a quasi-humanoid avian creature[[footnote]]Resembling a crested barbet, //Trachyphonus vaillantii//.[[/footnote]] and a Class III[[footnote]]Estimated, possibly higher.[[/footnote]] Type Blue entity. It is approximately 2 meters tall and weighs 96kg. SCP-6465 is a former member of [[[wandsmen-hub |the Wandsmen]]][[footnote]]GoI-5917[[/footnote]] and refers to itself as &#34;Sonne, Second Wandsman of Alkonost, Eavesdropper to All, Liberator of Harat and Slayer of Pages&#34;.

In addition to its powerful thaumaturgical abilities, the main concern with containment of SCP-6465 is its ability to teleport nearby whenever it is mentioned or specific information about it is communicated, be it verbally, electronically between and within computer systems, or read from a text medium. The exact extent of this ability is unknown, though information gained from a member of the Wandsmen during acquisition indicates that even very insignificant information communicated verbally or otherwise might trigger a breach.

[[/div]]**Addendum 6465.1 - Initial contact:** The Foundation was first made aware of SCP-6465 through the Wandsmen, in an attempt to hand it over for custody.

**Camera Transcript**
[[/=]]
**Location:** Director Stone&#39;s office, Site-51.
**Date:** 2021-10-27, 18:36.

//[Director Stone sits in her office doing paperwork. A member of the Wandsmen, later designated PoI-65240, appears along with a crate marked with thaumaturgical runes. Director Stone is alerted and picks up her pistol.]//

**Stone:** What the fuck?!

**PoI-65240:** Wait wait wait please hold on, calm down.

**Stone:** Calm down? I understand we cooperate with your org but you can&#39;t just materialize in my office like that. What&#39;s in the box?

**PoI-65240:** I&#39;ll explain in a second, I need to draw something on your walls.

**Stone:** Draw something on my-? What&#39;s in the box?

**PoI-65240:** I can&#39;t tell you what&#39;s in the box until-

//[A bump is heard inside the crate, SCP-6465 enters through the door.]//

**SCP-6465:** Until what?

**PoI-65240:** Gods fucking dammit.

//[SCP-6465 waves and teleports away.]//

**PoI-65240:** Fuck fuck fuck fuck I&#39;m in so much trouble.

**Stone:** What-

//[PoI-65240 takes out her copy of [[[SCP-5917]]].]//

**PoI-65240:** Main Office.

//[PoI-65240 disappears.]//
-----
**Notes:** Later examination of the runes on the crate indicated that they&#39;re a type of ward previously unknown to the Foundation. Their effects are similar to those of Euler Aspect-Limiting Runes and they seem to amplify each other.[[/div]]

[[/div]]**Addendum 6465.2 - Acquisition:** 52 days later, PoI-65240 reappeared in Director Stone&#39;s office, with an identical crate again containing SCP-6465.

**Location:** Director Stone&#39;s office, Site-51.
**Date:** 2021-12-18, 14:22.

**PoI-65240:** Hello again... Maria, was it?

**Stone:** I never told you my name.

**PoI-65240:** Right. I guess I also forgot. Second Wandswoman of Auberon, you can call me Auberon-2, pleasure is all mine. Okay, so you&#39;ve already seen what happens if you make this more of a pain in the ass than it needs to be. I&#39;m gonna draw some harmless runes, disconnect the camera in this room from the network, and then I&#39;ll explain everything. I promise.

**Stone:** You know full well I can&#39;t let you do that.

**PoI-65240:** Well, it has to happen. Do you have any empty rooms? Look, if you don&#39;t trust me, call one of your thaumaturges, they&#39;ll attest that I&#39;m not doing something sneaky. Also, you should probably keep in mind if I wanted anyone here dead I wouldn&#39;t need to go through all this.

**Stone:** I think I can make that work, let me make a call.

**PoI-65240:** And whatever you do, don&#39;t mention the crate. Don&#39;t have anyone touch it. Don&#39;t let anyone in your office while we&#39;re gone, if you can help it.
[[/div]]A free interview room was used for the meeting. As per request, PoI-65240 was allowed to draw thaumaturgical wards under supervision and disconnect the cameras and microphones. Director Stone was accompanied by a security officer and the meeting was recorded on PoI-65240&#39;s pen.

**Audio Log**
[[/=]]
**Stone:** So, these runes you drew, they seem familiar.

**PoI-65240:** Just standard shielding runes. You probably know them as Someone-Someone Exclusion Wards or something. Pretty weird to slap a name on such a standard bit of warding like you came up with it, but anyway, let&#39;s talk shop.

**PoI-65240:** That guy upstairs, his name is Sonne, he&#39;s one of the most powerful name magicians we&#39;ve come across. A while ago, he came up with this... Technique? Spell? Something that lets him appear where he&#39;s mentioned. You already saw this in action that other time, after I slipped up and told you about how I can&#39;t tell you about him.

**Stone:** What do you know about how it works?

**PoI-65240:** Not much, but basically any time you mention him, read something about him, throw a message in a bottle into the ocean about him, carry around some paper about him... Anything really, he has some way of appearing nearby if he wants. Usually he&#39;ll pop up from around a corner, or appear in front of you to bump you so you&#39;ll drop all your documents, or that kind of stupid hijinks you&#39;d see in a movie. He //can// just, like, teleport, but he likes the stupid theatrics cause it pisses people off.

**Stone:** How do you reckon we can deal with him?

**PoI-65240:** Well, don&#39;t talk about him, obviously, but if you have to, which obviously you need to, you use these runes. They&#39;ll separate the space inside from thaumaturgical influence from outside.

**Stone:** Can&#39;t we just surround him with these?

**PoI-65240:** If only. The runes on the crate are to limit his direct powers. Shielding him does nothing, not even stop him from teleporting. This is most likely some kind of self-sustaining spell ticking away somewhere in your universe, or hell, who knows, maybe he just went and wrote a new law of the universe just for himself. Point is, whatever causes this is not directly on him. You can even mention him while in the same exclusion field as him and nothing happens.

**Stone:** I see. Do we know what exactly the limits of what he can see are?

**PoI-65240:** Well, the only thing we know //won&#39;t// let him appear is knowledge in your memories, fortunately. Maybe because it&#39;s too complex, maybe brains evolved some slight shielding against this kind of threat, we don&#39;t know, and he won&#39;t tell. Beyond that, pretty much anything; carrying around a hard drive with encrypted info about him, telegraph a poem about how not to summon him, you fucking name it. You&#39;ll wanna put this pen I&#39;m recording on in a secure box if you&#39;re gonna move it out of this room.

**Stone:** Alright. On a different note, why exactly are you handing him over to us?

**PoI-65240:** Well, the teleporting thing itself isn&#39;t exactly the problem; in fact it&#39;s quite useful for the job. Let&#39;s just leave it at that he committed unforgivable crimes against knowledge, and we know you&#39;re the only people who can really keep him locked.

**Stone:** We&#39;ll certainly try. Thank you for the help.

**PoI-65240:** Oh, one last thing, when you assign the guy a number, don&#39;t tell him about it. You&#39;ve already made that mistake [[[SCP-5316 | once]]].
