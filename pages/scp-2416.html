**Item #:** SCP-2416

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The current instance of SCP-2416 (now SCP-2416-21) is to be kept in a drug-induced coma at Site-59 and monitored for vital signs. If SCP-2416-21 dies for any reason, Mobile Task Force Omicron-8 &#34;Send In The Clowns&#34; is to be placed on high alert, and the replacement instance is to be apprehended and contained in the same manner as soon as possible. 

**Description:** SCP-2416 refers to multiple instances of a 35-year-old Caucasian human male named Joseph Grunderson-Pike. Despite having unextraordinary brain activity and no history of neurological disorders, SCP-2416 displays diminished intellectual capacity and a high likelihood of getting into a lethal accident.

On 1/14/2006, SCP-2416-1, the original[[footnote]] Insofar as the Foundation is aware; the likelihood of previous instances has not been ruled out. [[/footnote]] instance, was killed after walking onto an expressway in Chicago. This was not believed to have been suicide; shortly before it was struck by a speeding minivan, its last words were reportedly &#34;Hey, this isn&#39;t State street!&#34; SCP-2416-1 had funeral services, was cremated, and its death was reported in multiple Chicago newspapers.

On 3/15/2006, a living instance of SCP-2416, SCP-2416-2, was stabbed to death in Omaha after it tied a convicted murderer&#39;s shoelaces together for a prank. SCP-2416-2 was determined by law enforcement officials to be an outsider with no friends or relations in Omaha and was buried.

It is unknown how a new instance of SCP-2416 appears after the death of a previous instance. The latest instance always claims to have no recollection of having died at all, and has passed multiple polygraph tests while giving this testimony. The origin point of a &#34;reincarnated&#34; instance has never been successfully located, and all sightings of SCP-2416 instances have been after-the-fact.

&gt; **Dr. Ichinose:** Please state your name for the record, SCP-2416-20.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2416-20:** Joe Grunderson-Pike. I got a quick question before we get started.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ichinose:** Yes?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2416-20:** What did you say was the normal amount of those pills you gave me to take for a headache?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ichinose:** Two tablets.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2416-20:** Wow. Yeah, that... That actually makes a lot more sense.

&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ichinose:** Medic!
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;End Log&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** SCP-2416-20 died shortly thereafter. SCP-2416-21 was later found wandering the streets of San Francisco and apprehended.
