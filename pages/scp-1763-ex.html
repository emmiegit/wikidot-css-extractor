&gt; ------
&gt; **Item #:** SCP-1763
&gt; 
&gt; **Object Class:** Keter
&gt; 
&gt; **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1763 is currently contained within a specially constructed Hostile Organism Containment Chamber at Site-94, fitted with high-durability surveillance technology and sprinkler systems retrofitted to dispense gaseous sedatives. SCP-1763 is to be fed one adult pig on the first of each month, or the equivalent in pre-prepared meat. No additional contact with the entity is to be made.
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** SCP-1763 is a large (averaging twelve metres in length), nocturnal, carnivorous mammal, formerly native to farmland in rural England. SCP-1763 possesses minor perception-altering capabilities, which it uses to conceal itself through rudimentary camouflage. When given sufficient opportunity, SCP-1763 displays an extremely predatory nature.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-1763&#39;s morphology is somewhat variable, as is the strength of its primary anomalous effect, with the entity tending to increase in size and decrease in visibility over time. It is hypothesised that this represents accelerated adaption to an environment in which observation is nearly constant, and the potential limit to this adaption is unknown. As SCP-1763 has so far been responsible for upwards of 30 fatalities while in containment, research is currently a high-level priority.

&gt; **Item #:** SCP-1763
&gt; 
&gt; **Object Class:** Keter
&gt; 
&gt; **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1763 is currently contained within a specially constructed Hostile Organism Containment Chamber at Site-94, fitted with high-durability surveillance technology and sprinkler systems retrofitted to dispense gaseous sedatives ##blue|and corrosive fluids. Said systems are to be activated in the event that SCP-1763 attempts to harm personnel, breach containment, or otherwise interfere with Foundation activities##. SCP-1763 is to be fed --one adult pig-- ##blue|two adult pigs## on the first of each month, or the equivalent in pre-prepared meat. No additional contact with the entity is to be made.
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** SCP-1763 is a large (averaging ##blue|eighteen## metres in length), nocturnal, carnivorous mammal, formerly native to farmland in rural England. SCP-1763 possesses minor perception-altering capabilities, which it uses to conceal itself through rudimentary camouflage. ##blue|SCP-1763 is able to disguise both its physical appearance and any sounds it makes, and is capable of removing memories of such qualities from nearby individuals.## When given sufficient opportunity, SCP-1763 will utilise these abilities to stalk, hunt, and kill any potential prey.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-1763&#39;s morphology is --somewhat-- ##blue|extremely## variable, as is the strength of its primary anomalous effect, with the entity tending to increase in size and decrease in ##blue|general perceptibility## over time. It is hypothesised that this represents accelerated adaption to an environment in which observation is nearly constant, and the potential limit to this adaption is unknown. As SCP-1763 has so far been responsible for upwards of 30 fatalities while in containment, research is currently --a high-level priority-- ##blue|discontinued##.
 
&gt; __**{{Document-1763-EX-128, 03/11/1995}}**__
&gt; ------
&gt; **Item #:** SCP-1763
&gt; 
&gt; **Object Class:** Keter
&gt; 
&gt; **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1763 is currently contained ##blue|within a large area of woodland[[footnote]]Designated Area-764.[[/footnote]], bordered by an electrified chain-link fence. The remains of Site-94, located at the centre of this area, are off-limits to all personnel. SCP-1763 does not require feeding, as it seems to have a ready supply of fresh meat located somewhere within the area##.
&gt; 
&gt; No --additional-- contact with the entity is to be made.
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** ##blue|SCP-1763 is a largely imperceptible creature, estimated to be upwards of twenty-four metres in length. SCP-1763 is carnivorous and predatory towards all higher lifeforms, and as-such poses a high threat to any persons within the containment zone. SCP-1763 can not be directly considered by any subjects within a --20 metre-- --100 metre-- --200 metre-- large radius of the entity, and can exert an unspecified memetic effect on any subjects who have directly seen evidence of the entity&#39;s existence.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|A total of 30 deaths have been attributed to SCP-1763 since its initial containment, but the actual figure is expected to be at least double this.##

&gt; **Item #:** SCP-1763
&gt; 
&gt; **Object Class:** ##blue|None##
&gt; 
&gt; **Special Containment Procedures:** ##blue|No plan for containment of SCP-1763 has been devised at time of writing. Any areas referred to as Site-94 or Area-764 are to be reported immediately -- under no circumstances should any personnel enter these areas, as no persons have any recollection of such areas&#39; construction or creation.##
&gt; 
&gt; No contact with the entity --is to be made-- ##blue|can currently be made##.
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** SCP-1763 is a ##blue|semi-metaphysical entity capable of excising itself at will from various aspects of reality, both real and imagined. SCP-1763 is currently both invisible and silent, possesses no heat-signature, can render itself selectively intangible, and is capable of exerting a strong memetic effect on nearby humans, removing, censoring, and corrupting information about itself stored in the subject&#39;s brain. Additionally, tangentially related information in a variety of mediums is suspected to be at risk, though this is unconfirmed. Due to a lack of staff assigned to the project, all research on SCP-1763 is postponed for the foreseeable future.##
&gt; 
&gt; A total of 30 deaths have been attributed to SCP-1763 --since its initial containment-- ##blue|since its cataloguing on {-0/-0/@@--@@00}[[footnote]]**{{ERROR: Null field abort;}}**[[/footnote]]. Despite this, no records of any such deceased persons exist. SCP-1763&#39;s motive for attacking and killing Foundation personnel, if any, is unknown.##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|Several other iterations of this article have been located, referring to the entity as a physical creature -- it is believed, therefore, that SCP-1763 was at one point both actively contained by the Foundation and not able to exert the range of anomalous phenomena available to it at present. Further inference suggests that SCP-1763&#39;s excision of itself from standard methods of perception is part of an ongoing trend, in which the entity is rendered less &#39;real&#39; over time, possibly as a survival technique, natural adaptation, or as a method of acquiring food. For obvious reasons, no elements of this hypothesis can be verified,,D,,//;-##
&gt; 
&gt; ##blue|-/Whether SC-,,P,,/1763 does, in fact, exist is _{{currently ^^unc|ea^^r}};##
&gt; 
&gt; **Addendum:**
&gt;&gt; ##blue|**{{Data missing##.}}**

//~ Documents recovered from the personal computer of an unknown Researcher, 03/01/2018. Believed to be a categorisation for a nonexistent anomaly (possibly devised for recreational or academic purposes), and classified as Explained after brief confusion arising from its discovery. Personnel are reminded that no entities or phenomena portrayed within represent any manner of threat to either the Foundation, staff thereof, or the human population in general, and are, in fact, entirely fictional.//
