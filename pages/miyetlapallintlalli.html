//Listen, and you shall hear a story.//

//Before aught else existed, and the universe was a formless void, Hualma came to be. There was no time in the void, yet he waited; no space, yet he was still alone. And Hualma grew lonely, thus, for he was from the beginning a god of creation, and his desire grew stronger than anything that has yet been to make things, and things that would be separate from himself, and would own themselves as he owned the void.//

//And he took a portion of himself into his hands like clay, and moulded it to make something other than himself: servants. The first servant Hualma created was the Wind, and he sent her down into the void to be his messenger, and to observe all that he should do afterwards. The second servant Hualma created was the Earth, and he sent him down to uphold the wind and to be a foundation upon which his creation would rest. The third servant Hualma created was the Water, and he sent him to divide the Earth, to soften it and shape it, and to be a messenger upon the surface of the earth rather than through the dome of the sky.//

//Fourth and fifth Hualma made the suns, Atli the white sun and Teyo the orange sun, and sixth and seventh he made the moons, Yeri the yellow and Ina the silver. And he set them to illuminate both the days and the nights, and to keep the days, months, and years of time. And thus were created both the leagues of space and the count of time.//

//And when Hualma looked upon his world, he saw that all was now prepared for life to arise. So he took another portion of himself, and he mixed it with the air and the water and the earth and the light that now existed, and it became as fluid as the slip used by potters. Over the world he scattered it in drops like rain, and where each drop fell it sprung up into a living creature - the trees and the plants and the hunting animals and the hunted, the birds and the worms and the fungi hidden within the leafmould. And they grew and multiplied, and covered the world with green and red and rich yellows and blues, and Hualma seeing this took the world and set it before himself, that he might watch it grow and develop throughout eternal ages.//

//But when the rainstorms wash away the dust from the airs, sometimes one can still see the glittering scars from where his fingers held the world during its making. And that is how we get our name, the Land under Many Colours, for we were made by the same hands that scored the sky bright, and that is how you can know that this is true.//

* [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/heart-rot-chapter-1 Heart Rot]
 * Everyone knows that fate cannot be defied, and everyone knows that twin children have a particular fate laid out for them even from their birth - always, in every pair, one twin is good and the other is evil, one a blessing and the other a curse on their communities. Brothers Comalpo and Tliichpil also know this, of course. The only thing they don&#39;t know is which one of them is which.
* [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/wind-dance-chapter-1 Wind Dance]
 * Always Zintlāchmina has yearned for nothing more than honour. But when she encounters a runaway from a distant city with secrets of her own near her isolated mountain village, who is to say what is the honourable response?
* [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/salt-water-chapter-1 Salt Water]
 * Being arranged to wed his best friend should be ideal for Oquio - if he didn&#39;t fear it would destroy the existing relationship. How far ought he to do to ensure he and his betrothed remain as they are, not remade in the image of a contrived matrimony?

[[size x-large]]Description[[/size]]
The documents the Library has regarding Miyetlapalintlalli draw a picture of an agrarian society deeply rooted in their ecosystem, with resources sourced from forest, field, river, and tundra. Inhabiting scattered villages and few urban centres throughout the mighty emerald forest sweeping up to snow-dusted mountains, its people are honest and hardworking enough to almost seem carved, like the amulets they wear, from the underlying stone itself.

The culture places a heavy focus on family, community, honour, and right behaviour; the relationship of the individual with their society is valued above all other things. The majority of their stories focus not on deeds of great valour but on relationships between friends and family, for these can be just as fraught as a solitary journey through the wilderness or the pursuit of war. 

Hualma, who made the world, is held in the highest honour among all spirits, but the land positively hums with souls - of tree and stream, animal and plant, from the largest predators to the smallest creeping beetles. Both religion and magic exist in Miyetlapalintlalli not as separate domain, but rather as light exists: themselves unseen, and yet by them one can see everything else.

[[size x-large]]How to Contribute[[/size]]
* Almost all types of stories are permitted, as long as they meet the site rules. If you want your draft reviewed for adherence to existing worldbuilding, please PM [[*user OriCat]].
* Effort should be made to ensure new stories do not conflict with existing canon. The easiest way to do this is to focus on characters that are either new or not established main characters.
* Character names should have Nahuan features. 
* Colour schemes are not required but can be added if desired. You can make your own or request one made for you.</textarea></pre>
