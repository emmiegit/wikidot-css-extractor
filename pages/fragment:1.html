    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-2689

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Explained

**Special Containment Procedures:** --A Foundation front company has purchased SCP-2689. Security personnel are to prevent unauthorized entry.-- SCP-2689 has been reclassified as Explained. No further containment procedures are necessary.

**Description:** SCP-2689 is an office space located beneath the Fairfax County Municipal Office Building in Fairfax County, Virginia. SCP-2689 is accessible through a single entrance at the north end of the building. --This entrance is devoid of external markings, save for a heavily damaged metal placard above the door frame which reads &#34;[[[scp-3790|Department of Abnormalities]]]&#34; in bright yellow lettering.--

--Effects upon entering SCP-2689 vary between individuals. Subjects with a history of white-collar crime[[footnote]] Such as embezzlement or fraud. [[/footnote]], accounting[[footnote]] This has only been demonstrated to occur in approximately 52% of cases. [[/footnote]], or investment banking report overwhelming feelings of dread upon entry. Subjects with a background in revenue collection or other similar occupations report feelings of gratification and authority. Subjects with no history in these areas describe more broad feelings of unease, as if anticipating a &#34;sudden loss&#34;.--



--SCP-2689 is currently being monitored for further anomalous activity per Overseer Directive-001/3790.--  See Addendum.

**Addendum:** Incident 2689-1

The following incident was captured on CCTV surveillance footage on July 9th, 2021.

&gt; **[END LOG]**

George Chandler was released 48 hours later after enhanced interrogation revealed no ulterior motivations for attempting to access SCP-2689. Searches of Chandler&#39;s vehicle failed locate any additional items of note, save for non-anomalous repair tools and a small metal placard which read as follows:
