**Item #:** SCP-909

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-909 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. No writing materials are to be allowed inside the cell. A short summary of SCP-909&#39;s current situation is to be pasted on the wall beside the bed. Extras are to be provided if the previous summary is removed by SCP-909. SCP-909 is to be fed three times daily with any peanut-free meal. If SCP-909 is seen attempting to write or draw, he is to be incapacitated through non-lethal means.

Currently experimentation with SCP-909&#39;s effects has been discontinued, due to risk of containment breach. Research may be conducted if the current Site Director&#39;s approval is given.

As of current regulations on &#34;Misters&#34;, SCP-909 is to be contained in Hall ██ of Site-██.

**Description:** SCP-909 appears to be a young adult Caucasian male suffering from permanent anterograde amnesia. SCP-909 seems to be aware of his condition but cannot recall experiences past this, aside from memories gained due to SCP-909&#39;s effects.

SCP-909&#39;s anomalous effects become apparent when it writes down any of the experiences still in its working memory. When described through writing, experiences immediately enter SCP-909&#39;s long term memory. However, the experience disappears from the memory of all other persons involved.

SCP-909 is allergic to peanuts and will go into anaphylactic shock following the ingestion of any peanut products.

SCP-909 was discovered at Entrance [EXPUNGED] of Site-██.

**Addendum 909-1:** The words &#34;Mr. Forgetful, from Little Misters ® by Dr. Wondertainment&#34; are tattooed upon SCP-909&#39;s right calf. Upon discovery SCP-909 had been wearing a 3-piece suit with the brand name &#34;Doctor&#39;s Orders&#34; sewn into the tag. Foundation personnel have yet to find a clothing company operating under this name.

**Addendum 909-2:** Further examination of SCP-909&#39;s clothing revealed a list of other possible instances of anomalous humanoids similar to SCP-909 (See Document 909-a) inside the left pants pocket.

**Addendum 909-3:** Interview Log

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-909
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. ███████████
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** SCP-909 was put into initial observation for seven hours, during which the subject&#39;s anterograde amnesia and relation to [[[SCP-905]]] were discovered. SCP-909 was then taken in for interview.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████████:** Good morning, Nine-Oh-Nine.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-909:** Nine-Oh-Nine? Why are you calling me that? And where am I, anyways?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████████:** (Reading from sheet of paper) You are the SCP designated 909, and you are currently under my custody. I am a doctor of the Foundation, and I am going to research your anomalous effects.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-909:** The Foundation? What&#39;s that? Why d-
&gt; 
&gt; NOTE: At this point Dr. ███████████ presses a small button, generating a loud noise lasting 5 seconds. SCP-909 is seen to lose focus.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████████:** Hello, Nine-Oh-Nine.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-909:** Nine-Oh-Nine? Why are you calling me that? And where am I, anyways?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████████:** (Reading from sheet of paper) You are the SCP designated 909, and you are currently under my custody. I am a Doctor of The Foundation, and I am going to research your anomalous effects.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-909:** The Foundation? Wha-
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████████:** Okay, let&#39;s try something else. Write down what I just told you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-909:** Alright. (SCP-909 accepts the pen and stationery and proceeds to write.)
&gt; 
&gt; NOTE: Later investigation of Dr. ███████████&#39;s notes showed that he had planned to press the button previously mentioned at this point.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. ███████████:** (Brief pause) Hey, who are you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-909:** I&#39;m the, uh, SCP under your custody. Don&#39;t you remember?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████████:** Huh?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-909:** Don&#39;t you remember?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ███████████:** No. Where am I? What is this place?
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Dr. ███████████ and SCP-909 were removed from the room amid confusion from all personnel involved in the incident. SCP-909 later explained the situation to uninvolved personnel and was placed in his holding cell. Dr. ███████████ was discharged from duty and given a Class-B amnestic.

**Addendum 909-3:** //The document shown was in the possession of SCP-909. [[[SCP-905]]] states that it &#34;lost its copy in the breeze&#34;, [[[SCP-913]]] apparently ingested its own copy. [[[SCP-917]]] had held a similar list which can be found in Document 917-a. [[[SCP-920]]] claims to have misplaced its copy.// - Dr. ███████████
