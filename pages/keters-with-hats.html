&gt; **Paul:** Caaarl! Why is there a [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-173 statue] in our house? It&#39;s looking at me funny.
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Whatever do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** The statue. Right there. It&#39;s in the middle of our living room.
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Oh, that! I thought that was a mountain.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Mountains don&#39;t fit in houses!
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** How do you know that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** I don&#39;t! How&#39;d you even get this here?
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** I didn&#39;t bring it here. For once I am innocent.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Then why is it looking at //you??//
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Must be my legs.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Where did you get this from?
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** My nice, sexy legs.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Answer me, Carl.
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** It came out of a top hat I was using for a magic trick.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Caaarl!
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Fine. I broke into a place called Site 19.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** How&#39;d you do that? You don&#39;t even have thumbs.
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** I used an egg sandwich and a mattress tag.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** What even is this thing?
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve tried eating it and it&#39;s just made of stone and paint.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Why would you break into somewhere and eat what you find?
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Because the egg sandwich wasn&#39;t enough.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** I&#39;m not listening anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; (Paul turns before Carl blinks.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Woah! That thing just moved.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** What? I turned my back for one second. What&#39;d you do?
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** I sunk a cruise ship 4 days ago.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** I didn&#39;t mean that!
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Then what did you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Why did it move?
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** It had to follow its destiny.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Caaarl!
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** It slipped on the floor.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Be honest with me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** I don&#39;t know! It probably noticed //your// legs.
&gt; 
&gt; (Paul turns around, seeing the statue in front of him.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Oh God.
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Yeah, this was probably my fault.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** You don&#39;t say?
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** At least I didn&#39;t bring back the other thing I found.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** What was it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Some [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-096 pale guy], long arms. I looked at him for one  second and he went crazy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** I&#39;m so disappointed in you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Well that&#39;s mean. Now I kind of wish I brought that pale guy back.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** I&#39;m not talking to you anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Well, that&#39;s rude. I&#39;m disappointed in you now.
&gt; 
&gt; (Banging at the door.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Who&#39;s that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Probably the pale dude.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** What? Why?
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Maybe it&#39;s the statue&#39;s best friend.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Caaarl!
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Well, I didn&#39;t know.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** You&#39;re just being awful today.
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** I stole this yesterday.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** I&#39;m not even shocked at this anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Fine, I&#39;ll go answer the door. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** You go do that, Carl.
&gt; 
&gt; (Carl walks to the door as Paul is stuck looking at the statue.) 
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Has it moved again?
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Not yet!
&gt; 
&gt; (Carl walks back.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Yep, it&#39;s that crazy guy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** I think you should keep the door closed, Carl.
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Fine.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** So, what should we do with this thing?
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Sell it to an art museum. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** I was thinking give it back.
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** No way, we could get so many dead bodies with this.
&gt; 
&gt; (Pause.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Caaaaaaarl!
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Fine, I&#39;ll give it back.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** No, I&#39;m giving it back. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Bad idea, Paul. They had lots of guns back there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Fine. Well, did you do anything else there?
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** I killed some people and ate some paper.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Oh.
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** I mean, it was [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-085 screaming] as I was eating it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** The people or the paper?
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** What do you think? It was the paper.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Caaarl! What have I told you about eating things that scream?
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** The egg sandwich wasn&#39;t enough.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Caaarl!
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** You&#39;re right. You&#39;ve told me not to do it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Right. Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;m going to find a way to give this statue back.
&gt; 
&gt; (Paul starts pushing the statue out of the house.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Yep, he&#39;s going to get slaughtered out there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** I can hear you, Carl!
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** Sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; (Paul exits the house, screaming.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Paul:** Caaaaaaarl!
&gt; 
&gt; **Carl:** I told you, Paul!
