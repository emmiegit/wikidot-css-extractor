**Item #:** SCP-7189

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7189 is kept in a lead storage container in site-19. No one under level 3 clearance can come on contact with SCP-7189. 3 guards of MTF Beta-777 (“Hecate&#39;s Spear”).The guards should have incineration weapons on hand. If under any circumstance anyone is in contact with SCP-7189 they are to be considered lost. The only measure to defeat SCP-7189-A and the instances are to be incinerated. SCP-7189 should be kept away from any person with mental or psychological damage should be kept at a distance of 70 meters. 
  
**Description:** SCP-7189 is a 12 by 16 cm diary with no noticeable difference on the cover except for the german phrase &#34;ein Tagebuch zum Liebhaben&#34; which means &#34;A Diary To Love&#34;. SCP-7189 has a hard red cover which is comprised of human femur bone of a girl of age 9-11 years the red color of the diary is made up of the blood of a pig the blood does not seem to oxidize the reason behind this is unknown and is still under research. There is a total of 334 pages in the diary all blank with no lines some of the pages are torn and some are burned.

SCP-7189&#39;s anomalous ability starts when a person above the age of 8 and lower than the age of 97 comes in contact with the diary the effects begin when the person starts to write about their life the person while writing the person is in a comatose state and they will write until the person is stripped away from SCP-7189 and the does not seem remember anything after being comatose. If the person is able to write more than three pages of information without going in a comatose state (See Addendum A). When a person has written three pages with going into a coma they are to be considered lost and no communication is to be established (See Addendum B). While people writing in SCP-7189 there seems to be no pages used and no words written but for the person who wrote in SCP-7189 it seems to refer to their childhood trauma (See Interview Log-7189). Reality anchors have been a little effective in containing SCP-7189-A. This is the only known way to contain SCP-7189-A.

People with mental trauma have a different effect (See Addendum C). The people with mental trauma make different instances of SCP-7189-B which show non visible physical alterations they are not possible to contain and should be report if found (incident-7189-1) report to MTF Beta-777 (“Hecate&#39;s Spear”).

**Addendum A:-** SCP-7189 when a person has written something with out going in a comatose state and write the diary 3 pages the person shows no physical change but the person is now become a instance of SCP-7189-A the person becomes more agile showing flexibility beyond of a normal human capability being able to dislocate and relocate bones with no problem what so ever ,the strength also increases to a supernatural degree being able to lift weight up to 4 tons and a grip strength of 1.5 tons the person loses all emotion including pain the instances also show superhuman durability being able to handle 50 caliber and being unaffected. The only way to dispose a instance is through flame throwers and high caliber guns. The only way distinguish between a instance of SCP-7189-A is through x-rays because they some how lose or gain bones in the frontal area of the skull. They show a nature of acting as humans and trying to blend with their surrounding people. These instances try to write within SCP-7189 and will do anything to get in contact with it.

**Addendum B:-**SCP-7189-A instance or formally known as Dr. K█████ who was the lead researcher of SCP-7189 and came into contact with without knowing of it someone had kept it on his desk and he had thought of it as his own diary the person who did this is still not found. Dr. K█████ was restrained via reality anchors which only help him contain him for a little while while being questioned he kept on referring to himself as a person with no soul when questioned why he was saying so the response from him was [DATA REDATED] and then broke his restrains and this cost in total 23 deaths and Dr. K█████ was finally put down via incineration.

**Addendum C:-**When an person with mental trauma enters a 30 meters area of SCP-7189 the person&#39;s eyes take a bluish color this is the only known visible physical alteration. The instances show no physical strength alterations instead they became a Class IV reality bender this only happens in 3% of the time. These instances show no weakness other that incineration but because of their high speeds and bending of the flames this is also not a highly recommended method but is they only method. In such a case that a instance of SCP-7189-C the site should be evacuated and the site will require reality anchors and then specialized MTF squad member will be let in. In the other 97% of the case the cease to exist and dematerialize and their whereabouts are unknown.

**Interview Log-7189:-** The following is the interview of D-786 who was kept in SCP-7189&#39;s camber for 3 hours Dr. S███████

Dr. S███████: Please state your name.
D-786: (silence)
Dr. S███████: Please state your name D-786.
D-786: My name is [DATA REDACTED].
Dr. S███████: So explain to me what have you written in SCP-7189.
D-786: I don&#39;t know what I did but when I went into that room with that thing you call SCP-7189 I felt something crawling down my spine and when I was told to write in the book or be able to see my brain so I had to agree but as soon as I touched the thing I saw something I was in a room with no windows no lights no nothing I felt like their was no air I felt someone or something whispering my name and I couldn&#39;t move then I saw &#34;it&#34; ( D-786 stops talking).
Dr. S███████: Can you describe &#34;it&#34;.
D-786: It was everything that I had experienced in my life it was as if I was staring in my mind but it was not good it was horrifying it was filled with all the bad things that happened in my life like the death of my mother, my girlfriend cheating on me with my best friend but how do I say this more intense like I known the pain and all but it was as if I was feeling worse and worse after some time &#34;it&#34; started to torture me not the physical way but the mental way &#39;it&#34; started killing my loved ones in front of me and then then &#34;it&#34; disappeared and then I could feel breathing near my neck a girl whispering and I could not see her since I could not move and then she started screaming and then she bit me on my neck (D-786 proceeds to show his neck and nothing was visible). And then I saw hundreds no millions of cockroaches climbing up my leg eating my flesh slowly very very very slowly it was as if I was meant to be tortured it started feel good for some reason I wanted more of it I wanted more I saw [DATA REDACTED]
