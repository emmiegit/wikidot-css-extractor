[[tab What is this?]]

So, somehow you&#39;ve managed to wander into a little thing called the Seas of Orcadia. This is a canon, a small one that is relatively new and hopefully will be growing. 

**What Exactly Does that Mean?** 

Well, this is a collaborative effort focused around a centralized narrative continuity, with the potential for infinitely many smaller continuities. In other words, there are many many stories to tell here. 

[[/tab]]

[[tab How To Write for the Canon]]

**How to Write for This?**

Orcadian mythology heavily borrows from a combination of Celtic and Norse mythology. Tales/SCP&#39;s within this canon aren&#39;t expected to adhere to any single major theme, but rather should try to broach/touch on aspects of this particular shared universe. I&#39;ll give a list of different things that compose the canon.  It&#39;s not required to follow these to the letter, but I encourage consideration.

* __Association with or around direct Orcadian Myths__, these don&#39;t have to be exactly in line with the extant mythologies, but //if// you are writing based on extant Orcadian/Shetland/Celtic/Norse mythology, it is highly recommended you do thorough research and evaluation of the cultures, the stories themselves, the environment/geography, and archaeological/anthropological history in order to understand the context and significance of what you are writing. Remember, Orcadian Mythology is based on the verbal and written traditions of REAL people and groups. Treat them with the same respect you would treat mythology from maligned or marginalized communities. That said, you do not have to write explicitly based on Orcadian mythologies. Make up your own material, as long as it fits within the canons themes.
* __The Foundation is the man on top__, they have access to vast resources, contain a large number of anomalies, and have a pool of highly trained and experienced research personnel. Despite this, the Foundation in this canon are hesitant to use anomalies outside of desperate, large scale events, but events have forced their hand into an alliance. They acknowledge and know magic and magic based technology exists, but they do not have the same level of understanding and utilization that other GoI&#39;s may have. 
* __The Finnfolk are a Major and Powerful civilization with significant historical impact.__ The Finnfolk are an integral part of the canon, Seas of Orcadia articles/tales/GoI formats do not have to directly focus or mention them, but they are and were an influential civilization on a global scale. Their history and lore is somewhat formulated, but not 100% solidified. 
* __Magic, fantasy, and myth are big parts of this canon__. Lore is important, and its still being built. DrBleep is writing from a specific vantage point with a set pantheon of gods. You do not have to follow her example in your writing, but like other major canons, there are certain things that will make this canon what it is . You don&#39;t have to be //100%// in line with everything that happens in tales, scps, and/or GoI formats, as there will be lots of wiggle room given the arcane nature of the works in this canon. Get creative with your interpretation, just keep in mind what others have already written!
* __DrBleep has written a pantheon of 13 deities for the Canon__. Each deity was carefully chosen based on their prominence within the Wiki/Orcadian lore. Some of their background tales, and GoI&#39;s may not line up 100% with the goals of this canon, and sometimes they may conflict with each other based on other material that&#39;s written. This is OK, and expected as author&#39;s headcanons tend to differ. 
* __Locations will be global, but with a particular emphasis frequently calling back to the Orkney Islands__. This is pretty obvious.  
* __The Mither is Chained__.

[[tab Major Themes]]

++ Major Themes
The Seas of Orcadia Canon focuses on capturing major themes that are indicated below.

* __Mysticism/Legend/Mythological:__ Orcadia focuses heavily on a sense of mysticism, vague, almost urban legend/folk lore-ish stories and concepts that depict a world or world(s) that is vaguely familiar but also foreign, as if it could have existed but only in the way that mythology and legends are often based in steeped elements of actual history that have become transformed by the art of retelling over time into the land of a fiction.
* __Cycles. Nature Ebbs and Flows.__ A Major theme of the Orcadia canon is that nature runs in ebb and flow cycles. The climate and ecosystems of the Orkney islands were harsh, and at times unforgiving, but also bountiful, and plentiful in what they gave to their inhabitants. This is reflected heavily in the mythologies and folklore that stem from both Orkney and Shetland. Struggles against cruel aspects of nature is a itself is a holdover mythology from pre-Norse cultures.
*  __Fantasy__ A lot of Orcadia content is highly fantastical in nature, incorporating magic or cosmic scale. This is the kind of fantasy that is grounded in the stark mundane reality of the Foundation, and regular people, a contrast which lends itself well to evocative storytelling.
*  __Emotional Cores__ - Many Orcadia articles draw from strong emotional concepts build around the storytelling concepts and mechanics. Emotionally evocative works are a staple of the canon, ranging from love to loss to tragedy to parenthood to fear.

[[tab The Finnfolk]]

++ Who Are the Finnfolk?

+++ Background in Orkney Folklore
In Orcadian mythology the Finnfolk are a race of merfolk who draw from many different traits and histories, both from the neo-lithic cultures that occupied the islands, and the more traditional Norse Finn mythologies. Finnfolk are typically depicted as crafty, sorcerous beings who abduct humans to serve as spouses, especially for young Finnwives so they may be prevented from turning ugly and old. The origins of their myths stem from the dual shamanistic nature of the Saami peoples of Northern Scandinavia, along with bleedover of the less pleasant traits of the Selkie. Abductions were likely the way in which Orcadian residents rationalized the disappearance of young fishermen in the often hostile seas of the Orkney Isles. In any case, the Finnfolk have one of the most extensive record in Orkney Folklore.

++++ Finnfolkaheem

In Orcadian mythology, the Finnfolk originated from a massive, underwater city made of beautiful crystals and is often described as a mythical sensual paradise. 

++++ Hildaland

Hildaland was described as a mythical moving island, typically invisible or unreachable except by accompanying, or closely following Finnfolk. It was said to server as a summer home for the Finnfolk, until humans came and sanctified it, rendering it uninhabitable by the Finnfolk.

+++ Who are the Finnfolk in this canon.

The Finnfolk are a race of amphibious Hominids, Homo Aquarius, closely related to humans. More specific details about their anatomy can be found in existing articles, and perhaps eventually a GOI hub. The Finnfolk are exceptionally smart, and live nearly 10x as long as humans. They are highly magical beings, though not all of them are of the caliber necessary to be active mages. Finnfolk technology is complicated, and relies on advanced thaumaturgic technology and generation of &#34;power&#34; through linkages into the Astral Plane. This results in a fusion of imagery that sits somewhere between the pure fantasy of Atlantis the Lost Empire, and the Science Fiction of Mass Effect.

Finnfolk society is structured based on a Hierarchy of needs. When not threatened by outside forces, it functions like a true meritocracy. The Finnfolk are typically egalitarian, and due to their advanced thaumaturgic capabilities, they live in what might be described as a paradise or utopia when not threatened by outside forces. Much like in their Origin mythologies, their homes, cities, and technology is built using combinations of crystal and organo-metallic polymers, giving their structural and technological architecture an organic feel, where the thaumaturgy that flows through them brings them to life.

Finnfolk Society is capped by what could be considered a constitutional or regulated monarchy. In theory, the Queen/King of the Finnfolk serves as a figurehead, who signs and gives approval to legislation passed by a council of magisters representing various constituencies of Finnfolk Society.  

As many of the nastier elements of the Finnfolk have been juxtaposed on the wiki into Selkie articles, the Finnfolk in the Orcadia Canon have been somewhat shuffled to distinguish them from the Selkie, while maintaining many of the core elements of their mythological background. The Finnfolk are tolerant of Humans, having once intermingled and been indifferent/friendly with them. 

A combination of past events drove the Finnfolk from their terrestrial homes, leading to a large diaspora to more remote, aquatic/terrestrial environments, giving rise to many of the Merfolk myths. Many pockets of Finnfolk are thus, naturally secluded, and wary of human interaction due to the hostile past. By proxy, the Finnfolk are typically treated as threats or adversaries to many ancient GoI&#39;s due to their juxtaposed societal morals, and their relatively advanced technological and thaumatological state. In turn the Finnfolk do not get along well with groups like the Sarkics, the Mekhanites, Daevites etc. as separately, each civilization contributed to the decline of greater Finnfolk territory.
