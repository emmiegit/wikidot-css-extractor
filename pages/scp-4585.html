**Item Number:** SCP-4585

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4585 is to be stored within a soundproofed containment cell at Site-50. Interaction with SCP-4585 requires Level 2 or higher security clearance. 

**Description:** SCP-4585, physically, is a standard hamburger made by the Steak &#39;n Shake Corporation. SCP-4585 is sapient, and can speak in German via a voice of unknown origin. This voice has reached a maximum of 142 dB. SCP-4585 is also capable of using the five senses[[footnote]] Hearing, sight, taste, smell, touch [[/footnote]] and will not decompose. SCP-4585 can voluntarily cause SCP-4585-1 manifestation events, but is unable to cause a manifestation event if less than one month has elapsed since the last one. SCP-4585-1 manifestation events can number a maximum of 25 manifestations.

Physically, SCP-4585-1 instances are smaller than SCP-4585, but otherwise identical. In addition to SCP-4585&#39;s anomalous properties, SCP-4585-1 instances also possess the ability to generate french fries. They utilize said french fries in a similar fashion to a throwing spear. SCP-4585-1 instances use telekinesis to throw these weapons, but have not shown this ability on other objects. The french fry will demanifest after it is thrown.

In the event that the meat of an SCP-4585-1 instance is completely separated from the rest of the rest of the hamburger, all anomalous effects of that individual instance will cease. It is presumed that a similar effect takes place on SCP-4585 itself. 

Neither SCP-4585 or SCP-4585-1 instances are capable of locomotion.

**Addendum 4585-1:**
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Interview Log 4585-1&#34; hide=&#34;- Interview Log 4585-1&#34;]]
&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-4585
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Junior Researcher Johnson
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** This interview was conducted 12 days following SCP-4585’s discovery and containment. The interview has been translated into English.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Hello SCP-4585, I would like to ask you some questions.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** Who are you? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Alex Johnson, can I ask some questions?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** //(pause)// If you insist, I will humor you, what would you like to know?
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Where did you come from? Were you created at the Steak &#39;n Shake where we found you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** Oh, heavens no. I was born in my great city of Hamburg. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Uh, is that the Hamburg in Germany?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** Of course! No other city can touch its beauty! I am fortunate enough to be the city&#39;s rightful duke. You must sense that you are in the presence of great royalty, my friend.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Uh-huh, of course you are. If you originated in Germany, how did you end up a continent away?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** I swam.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** //(pause)// But, you can’t move.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** I am the Duke of Hamburg.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Can... how does that affect anything?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** I don’t follow.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Uh, whatever. We can return to that a little later. Are your //(pause)// subjects //(pause)// also like you? As in-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** Our appearance? Yes! That is part of what makes Hamburg so great! After all, it&#39;s a lot easier to catch this world’s criminals if they cannot move.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** that’s no- whatever. That&#39;s useful too, I guess. Is everyone in that place like you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Then how do you catch criminals? Actually, scratch that, how does the whole thing operate?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** I can assure you, our justice system is very effective. I don&#39;t even get involved! Just in case I feel the urge to do injustice on my citizens! Isn&#39;t that great!
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Sure, but, how does the city operate? I mean, nobody can move, you wouldn&#39;t be able to do anything other than sit around.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Approximately 4 seconds of silence]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** Excuse me, but are you threatening to incapacitate Hamburg! The greatest city of them all!
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** No, how wo-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** I will not allow you to attack my subjects, Johnson! This meeting is over!
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** I&#39;m the one who started this interv-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** SILENCE.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Johnson is seen covering his ears]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Jesus Fucking Christ! That was loud, you know!
&gt; 
&gt; **Senior Researcher Serdra (over intercom):** Hey, are you alright in there?
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Yeah, but it looks like we have the loudest thing in Site-50 over here!
&gt; 
&gt; **Senior Researcher Serdra (over intercom):** What abo-
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** I don&#39;t really care, this interview&#39;s over. Turn off that camera please.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Following this interview, Junior Researcher Johnson advised against classifying SCP-4585&#39;s Hamburg as SCP-4585-2, citing SCP-4585&#39;s inability to explain how the city would function. Further investigation into SCP-4585’s origins is recommended.

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-4585
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Junior Researcher Johnson
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** This interview was intended to further question SCP-4585 about its origins. Prior to this interview, SCP-4585-1 instances had not been discovered. The interview has been translated into English.

&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Hello SC- who the hell are you?
&gt; 
&gt; //[Junior Researcher Johnson notices an SCP-4585-1 instance in the room]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** This is Aurik, he is a member of my personal guard. Say hello Aurik.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585-1 Instance:** Hi.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** He is here to protect me from hostiles such as yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Oh, there&#39;s //(pause)// more of you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** Last time I very clearly said that there were more people like me, not that you were actually listening.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Uh, okay, I guess. I need to check with my superiors.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Junior Researcher Johnson leaves the room. 4 minutes and 16 seconds pass before Johnson reenters the room]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Okay, so can you tell me more about this Hamburg you mentioned last time?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** I have told you all you need to know in our last encounter.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Well, but could you give us a general layout of the city? We know of a city with the same n-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** Why would I do that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Well, you could bargain with us. Our organization has access to many th-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** Are you suggesting a trade between our two nations?
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Uhm, yeah, I could see it that way.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** Do you not remember our last meeting at all? Why would I trust you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Well, what do you want? What could we do to regain your trust?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** Hmm...
&gt; 
&gt; //[Roughly 2 seconds of silence]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** I want, at the very least, all of Site-50 ceded to the Duchy of Hamburg. Meaning me of course.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Ha! Uh no. Wait, how did you know the site number?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** Reconnaissance. Anyway, if you aren’t going to hand over Site-50, I will consider this trade a failure for the people of Hamburg.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Uh, can you elaborate on this reconnaissance you just mentioned?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** No, we are talking about a trade, are we not?
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Are you just g-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** Okay, this is starting to feel more like an interview then a meeting. Aurik, please escort this man from the room.

&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** How will you even do tha-

&gt; //[SCP-4585-1 manifests a French Fry, and throws it at Junior Researcher Johnson. It hits Johnson slightly above his nose]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Uh, was that a french fry?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** Aurik, keep firing!
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4585-1 continues to manifest french fries and bombard Johnson]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Okay, I’m just gonna take that thing out of here.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Johnson grabs the SCP-4585-1 instance and takes it out of the room.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** Hey! Do- Don’t worry Aurik! We’ll rescue you from these people! I’m coming!
&gt; 
&gt; //[Johnson leaves the room with the SCP-4585-1 instance]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** Come back here! I’ll kick your ass! Are you a coward?
&gt; 
&gt; //[Roughly 3 seconds pass]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** [UNINTELLIGIBLE] 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** SCP-4585 has been uncooperative in all follow-up interviews. Testing on the SCP-4585-1 instance was approved. For details on these tests, see Document 4585-T1. Due to Junior Researcher Johnson&#39;s lack of professionalism and tendency to provoke SCP-4585, he has been reprimanded and transferred to another project.

&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;13:55:56&gt;** Security guard John Trockies enters SCP-4585&#39;s cell on a routine sweep of Site-50&#39;s Safe Wing. SCP-4585 yells &#34;engage&#34; and all SCP-4585-1 instances open fire on Trockies.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;13:56:09&gt;** A french fry hits Trockies in the eye, causing him to retreat from the room. After some cheering, SCP-4585 and the -1 instances begin to sing the song &#34;Schwarzbraun ist die Haselnuss.&#34;[[footnote]] A military marching song that was commonly sung during World War 1 by German forces.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;14:06:49&gt;** The singing of &#34;Schwarzbraun ist die Haselnuss&#34; stops.

&gt; **SCP-4585:** Yes! Let&#39;s keep attacking, boys! Kill that thing!
&gt; 
&gt; //[Bheck gets up and leaves the containment cell. SCP-4585’s research team decide to attempt an interview over the cell’s intercom. Interview resumes after 4 minutes]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Senior Researcher Bheck (over intercom):** SCP-4585, could you please answer some questions?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585:** Ah, looks like you have to talk to me over this thing! At least have the dignity to talk to me to my face!
&gt; 
&gt; **Senior Researcher Bheck (over intercom):** Well, we can talk face to face. Just stop throwing french fries at my eyes, and we can talk.

&gt; 
&gt; **Senior Researcher Bheck (over intercom):** Okay, let&#39;s try this again tomorrow, we&#39;ll give you some time to calm down.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** The vocalizations of SCP-4585&#39;s &#34;Schwarzbraun ist die Haselnuss&#34; were heard in 15 adjacent rooms, reaching an estimated 100 dB. Due to noise complaints, SCP-4585 was scheduled to be moved to a soundproof cell on 4/9/1971.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+Transport Log 4585.1&#34; hide=&#34;-Transport Log 4585.1&#34;]]

On 4/9/1971, a convoy of 3 guards moved SCP-4585 to a soundproof containment cell via several on-site cardboard boxes. The following recording was taken from security guard Harold Unerp&#39;s body-worn camera. Note that this only shows a portion of SCP-4585&#39;s transport; for a full log, see Document 4585-TRP-1. English subtitles have been provided.

&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Harrison:** Erico? Should we just go through them?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Erico:** Well, considering the mess on Harrison&#39;s face, let&#39;s just go around.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Unerp:** Agreed.
&gt; 
&gt; //[The convoy begins to walk away from the SCP-4585-1 instances]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4585-1 Instance:** Wait //(pause)// What the hell are you doing! Get back here! That&#39;s not how war works!
