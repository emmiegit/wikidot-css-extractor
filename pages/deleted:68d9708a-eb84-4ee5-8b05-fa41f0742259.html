**Item #:** SCP-6564

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#psi-7 MTF Psi-7 (&#34;Home Improvement&#34;)] is to coordinate with embedded Agents to transfer residences affected by SCP-6564 to Foundation control. Affected individuals may only be interviewed by Agents who have attained a certification in ASL[[footnote]]American Sign Language.[[/footnote]] and have scored a CRI[[footnote]]Cognitive Resistance Index. An indicator of an individual&#39;s ability to withstand, and develop a precaution against -- potentially hazardous cognito-effects of an anomaly; first established in 1979 following the declassification of Project MKULTRA. Currently implemented in Foundation curriculum.[[/footnote]] value exceeding 5.8. Anyone who has had contact with the affected individuals (in excess of four weeks) is to be traced, identified and administered [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/amnestic-orientation-manual Class-C] amnestics before release.

**Description:** SCP-6564 is a spontaneous phenomenon that alters the behavior of random individuals when they are at home. These individuals have no connections with one another and have not encountered any anomalous events prior to SCP-6564, but have all been noted to reside in high-stress, urban areas.

As SCP-6564 begins, the subject completes their daily routine before returning to the bedroom. They remove the nearest chair or stool[[footnote]]If a chair or stool is not in the room, the individual removes one from another room they were previously in and brings it to the bedroom.[[/footnote]] and sits down in front of the window. Subject looks out of the window and remains seated throughout the day, often with a somber and relaxed expression.

During the course of SCP-6564, no adverse weather conditions persist over the immediate vicinity of the subject&#39;s home.

On the following day, they lose all hearing, although they do not display any distress from this.

The individual can respond to external stimuli, but is unable to engage in any meaningful conversation. They express confusion when such attempts are made, and they proceed to glance between their surroundings, the initiator of the conversation, and the window with visible tension. After several seconds, the individual regains composure, smiles, and politely waves the initiator off before they resume looking back towards the window.

The next morning, the subject disappears. In video footage, sunlight penetrates the window and intensifies in brightness, engulfing them. After 20 seconds, the ray of light dims, and arcs away to reveal an empty chair.

Seconds prior to their disappearance, the subject smiles, sighs, and closes their eyes, as if entering a state of deep sleep.

The subject&#39;s close family members are observed to return to their mundane routines significantly faster than anticipated from the amnesticization process. Internal investigations yielded no flaw in containment protocol.</textarea></pre>
