&#34;Afternoon, everyone. Have a seat. Get a cup of coffee and a muffin. Also, a reminder: the Seminar Rooms are a weapons-free zone. Please make sure you&#39;ve surrendered your weapons at the reception desk. I know, it&#39;s bullshit, but the last thing I need is an O5 complaining because one of you was walking around the Blue Zones with your piece. Everyone good? Cool.&#34;

&#34;Today&#39;s seminar is about a subject near and dear to my heart: Reality Benders. Type Greens. Mary Sues. Bixbies, Shapers, Wizards, Gods, Devils, Outside Observers, call them what you will, these are the guys that change reality based on perception and willpower. I&#39;ve made a career out of both containing and killing these guys. You&#39;re here to get certified to do the same thing.&#34;

&#34;Want to know my secret? We&#39;ll get to that later. First of all, I want you to take a look at the doors to the seminar room. Notice something about them? Look again. What doors?&#34;

&#34;Yes. The doors are gone. Take a closer look if you want. Touch them. They&#39;re not there. The doors have literally disappeared. But that&#39;s okay, right? You can still get out the windows if you want. Except there&#39;s one small problem. There aren&#39;t any windows in this room either, are there? All the windows are gone. There&#39;s nothing but four blank walls, a ceiling, and a floor. No way out. But how did you get in?&#34;

&#34;Starting to freak out a bit? Don&#39;t worry, just take a deep breath. You&#39;re going to be all right. Just a bit of a change to the way the room&#39;s set up. It&#39;s not like anything worse is happening. I mean, it could be worse, right? At least you&#39;re safe in here. It&#39;s not like the desks are coming alive to kill you now, is it? Oh wait, yes they are. The FUCKING DESKS ARE GOING TO KILL YOU.&#34;

&#34;What you gonna do? HOW YOU GONNA SURVIVE? THE GODDAMN ROOM IS ALIVE AND GOING TO EAT YOU. WATCH FOR THOSE FUCKING DESKS, THEY&#39;VE GOT TEETH. GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM THERE, NOW. YOU WANNA LIVE? YOU&#39;RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGHT! DON&#39;T TRY TO DENY IT, YOU MOTHERFUCKERS, THIS IS REAL. THIS IS HAPPENING. THIS IS A REALITY BEND, AND YOU&#39;RE GOING TO DIE UNLESS YOU CAN FIGHT IT NOW!&#34;

&#34;Oh, I see, a real TOUGH guy, huh? What the fuck are you gonna do with that 9mm? That gun really going to do anything? Against a REALITY BENDER!? I can turn your goddamn bullets into sand. I can turn your eyes into jello. I can turn your GUN into a fucking BAGEL, now PUT THAT DAMN GUN DOWN AND LIE THE FUCK DOWN ON THE GROUND, YOU FUCKNUGGET. I AM A LIVING GOD, AND YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A FUCKING INSECT!&#34;

&#34;What do I want? WHAT DO I WANT!? What the shit do I need from a fucking turd like you? I don&#39;t want ANYTHING that you can give me except to be my plaything. And that&#39;s ALL you fuckers are gonna be! You&#39;re gonna be nothing but toys in front of this God-King for all eternity. There is NO escape, NO respite. You will LIVE when I say LIVE, you will DIE only if I allow it. There is NOTHING LEFT BUT MY IMAGINATION, and you are all FIGMENTS OF IT!!!&#34;

&#34;. . .&#34;

&#34;. . . all right, hit the lights. Everyone breathe in and out, deep. Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. . . you feeling better now? Let me tell you what just happened.&#34;

&#34;Each and every one of you has just had a bad trip. All of the food on that back table was laced with a powerful hallucinogen. It&#39;s my own personal recipe. In addition to hallucinations, it renders one very susceptible to suggestion. Combined with some simple hypnosis and some special effects trickery, the end result is as close as we can get to showing you what a Reality Bender&#39;s attack feels like. The support staff are pumping an aerosolized counteragent into the air vents as we speak. It&#39;s going to feel like shit in a moment. You&#39;ll find barf bags under your chairs. Take a moment to let it all out.&#34;

&#34;I want you to reflect back on that moment when you realized what was happening. Do you remember that feeling of helplessness? Do you remember what it felt like to realize that reality no longer existed, and you were nothing but toys for a hostile will that controlled EVERYTHING?&#34;

&#34;Remember that. And hold onto it the first time you&#39;re about to go up against a Reality Bender. If you ever think that, maybe, you can contain them? Or maybe they can be reasoned with? Remember what it felt like when you were tripping balls and nothing was real.&#34;

&#34;Then kill that motherfucker before he knows you&#39;re even there.&#34;

&#34;You&#39;re all certified now. Class Dismissed.&#34;
