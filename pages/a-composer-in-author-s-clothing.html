//Day 1:// I got some comments about my name, but hey, I couldn&#39;t exactly lie. Not using my usual name, it wouldn&#39;t feel natural, and they&#39;d know something was up. But I got in, mostly without incident.

//Day 10:// I [http://wanderers-sandbox-2.wikidot.com/piano-s-second-composing-spot drafted] up something ridiculous and put it up for review today. The guy that tried to help out was super nice, very detailed and patient. I feel bad about lying to him.

//Day 42:// My first &#34;real&#34; story went up today. Apparently people love it, and they have no idea that its just another part of my masterful disguise.

//Day 136:// They still have no idea. Today begins the fulfillment of my **//__EVIL PLAN!!!__//** I WAS A COMPOSER ALL ALONG, YOU IDIOTS. ONE WHO DEDICATED THEIR LIFE TO THE CREATION OF MUSIC, NOT THIS LITERARY NONSENSE! I WILL NOW POST MUSIC TO A CREATIVE WRITING SITE, SHEDDING MY AUTHOR&#39;S TRAPPINGS AND INITIATING A HOSTILE TAKEOVER OF THIS WIKI! I WILL, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO POST SHORT STORIES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE THIN ILLUSION THAT I AM ONE OF THEM, AS TO KEEP THEM COMPLACENT AND THEREFORE HELPLESS!!! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!

Anyway, here&#39;s my stuff, hope ya like it.

//Literary works, these being pages I have written in the typical WL style to better solidify my false identity as an author among authors://

[[[Are you here?]]]
[[[Warm My Heart]]]
[[[Maybe They&#39;ve Changed]]][[collapsible show=&#34;The Curator&#34; hide=&#34;funky lil guy&#34;]]
[[[The Curator]]] is my author avatar, and after he was recently memed into renewed relevance, I decided to collect various artistic representations of her. Don&#39;t ask about the cat thing. 

(lots of image blocks to come)

[[/collapsible]][[[Just One Mountain]]]
[[[Welcome to Discera]]]
[[[The Hushing Forest]]]
[[[Day in the &#34;Life&#34;]]]
[[[Butterflies]]]
[[[Meditations on Sensation]]]
[[[Careful, it&#39;s Hot]]]
[[[Kiss thy Chains]]]
[[[Eirone√≠a-Hesperidean]]]

//Musical galleries, these being the real reason I&#39;m here, to subvert the artistic identity of this wiki. Go on, click on them. You know you want to. Feel yourself changed by the true potential of CC artwork!//

* [[[Library Theme Songs]]]

//Pages which I have not written, but have contributed to in either literary or musical fashion. Oh yeah, by the way, if you&#39;re an author who&#39;s made it here and ever want some music for your story or to go with artworks, shoot me a message. We&#39;ll see if we can work something out. No, I can&#39;t draw. Like, anything.//
