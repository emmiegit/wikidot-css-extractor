**Item #:** SCP-5001-J

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5001-J is to be kept in a standard janitor&#39;s closet located at Site-22. To prevent unauthorized access, all data retrieved from SCP-5001-J is to be stored on a cassette tape labeled &#34;Nickleback Silver Side Up&#34;.

**Description:** SCP-5001-J is a piece of cardboard on which a cassette player has been awkwardly attached with tape. On one side of the cardboard the words &#34;LOST MY JOB! - HAVE THREE KIDS TO FEED! - GOD BLESS YOU!&#34; have been scribbled on with a permanent marker. When worn, all nearby entities are unable to perceive the individual&#39;s existence or look in their direction, completely concealing the wearer. The cassette player contained a used tape, which has been transcribed as Archive 5001-J-1.

SCP-5001-J first appeared in a flash of light within [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-579-j SCP-579-J]&#39;s containment chamber at Site-579 on ██/██/██, containing a corpse[[footnote]] Cause of death determined to be sustained fractures and trauma across the entire body. Colloquially known as &#34;Fall Damage.&#34; [[/footnote]] genetically identical to Foundation employee Pizzaro Wilona. Pizzaro Wilona currently owns and operates a pizza delivery restaurant[[footnote]] One of a series of locally owned pizza joints within Foundation Sites. [[/footnote]] within Exclusionary Site-06, and [!--SCREW YOU IT&#39;S AMNESTIC NOW --]amnestic therapy has confirmed he has no knowledge of SCP-5001-J or memories concerning the events detailed within its archives.

&gt; It&#39;s-a me! Pizzaro!
&gt; 
&gt; I don&#39;t-a know what&#39;s happening but I might-a be the only one left!
&gt; 
&gt; Oh-a well, these-a Pizzas aren&#39;t going to deliver themselves!

&gt; **JOURNAL ENTRY 0001-2**
&gt; 
&gt; Pizzaro is going to-a Foundation safe-a house to deliver the pizza order I received not-a long before they came.
&gt; 
&gt; An order for-a two large pizzas with extra pepperoni and-a sausage. I was just-a finishing them up when this-a group of women with guns walked in saying they were-a Task Force Zeta-69 (&#34;Lonely Singles in Your Area&#34;). The guards let-a them in and they-a started shooting.
&gt; 
&gt; But Pizzaro was-a smart! Bullets or not Pizzaro is never late-a to deliver! This-a homeless woman, she-a been standing in front of Site-06 for weeks! She go-a running when the Task Force come. She leave her cardboard-a sign! The cardboard sign-a now Pizzaro&#39;s!
&gt; 
&gt; Those-a crazy people did not-a take anything. Pizzaro happy because they did not-a rob my restaurant, but they-a checked the bodies. Another bullet for everyone-a.
&gt; 
&gt; They were-a here to kill us.
&gt; 
&gt; But long as Pizzaro have-a delivery to make, Pizzaro will not-a be killed!

&gt; **JOURNAL ENTRY 0001-3**
&gt; 
&gt; Pizzaro make it to the safe-a house! Even after Pizzaro&#39;s Delivery van broke-a down in the desert! No matter, Pizzaro will deliver on wheels or on-a foot!
&gt; 
&gt; The Agents who order were-a dead, so Pizzaro leave the pizzas and take-a the money from their wallets. Pizzaro always deliver, but Pizzaro always get-a his payment too!
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ll-a rest here a bit before I leave!

&gt; For those that don&#39;t know, we are the SCP Foundation. For a hundred years our directive has been to collect all the world&#39;s monsters and other weird shit and put it in our weird shit jail.

The Foundation been-a releasing all their wacky things on everyone!

||~ Relevant Anomaly ||~ Action taken by the Foundation ||
|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-001-j SCP-001-J] || The Foundation has allied with the Order of the Sacred Button Pushers and has made it their goal to press SCP-001-J. The site&#39;s automated defense systems, which had been made impossible to shut down even by the Foundation itself, have so far been able to fight them off. ||
|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-020-j SCP-020-J] || Multiple instances of SCP-020-J are dropped in major urban centers worldwide. Hundreds have already kicked the bucket, and this number is expected to rise steadily. ||
|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-729-j SCP-729-J] || SCP-729-J ceases all anomalous effects against Foundation personnel. It is now being paraded around battlefields worldwide, and entire platoons of soldiers have surrendered or retreated upon sighting it. ||
|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-169-j SPC-169-J] || SPC-169-J is successfully punched through the use of an ICBF.[[footnote]] Inter-Continental Ballistic Fist. [[/footnote]] Waking it from its long slumber and sending it on a rampage against coastlines along the Southern Atlantic. The Atlantic fishing industry is decimated and many starve. ||
|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-ttku-j SCP-TTKU-J] || A thing matching SCP-TTKU-J&#39;s description is used to kill multiple politicians and heads of state, including individuals such as: [EXPUNGED BY ADVICE OF MY LAWYER]  ||
|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-666-j SCP-666-J] || Dr. Gerald is rapidly transported to the control centers of multiple large vehicles. Including: Buses, trains, large passenger airliners, military aircraft, warships, cruise liners, and several vehicular SCPs. No passengers from any of these vehicles have survived, and surrounding areas have been reduced to scorched wastelands. ||
|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-014-j SCP-014-J] || [DATA EXPUNGED] Death toll has reached 5,000,000.||
|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-682-j SCP-682-J] || The security measures, which until recently have kept it relatively contained within the Foundation&#39;s control so as to minimize possible human casualties, have been removed. Thus allowing for SCP-682-J to resume its homicidal intentions without Foundation interference, as the Foundation now sees this as beneficial to its goal. From this information one can conclude that this particular creature has begun a massive killing spree throughout nearby communities, and will kill many more in the following months. Which again, is now beneficial to the Foundation&#39;s goal, as opposed to before when they intended on keeping it contained so as to do the opposite. ||

**Context:** Some-a news footage Pizzaro save.

&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; //(Reporter Maria Henderson is speaking from a GOC evacuation tent. Next to her is a GOC Operative.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Maria Henderson:** - repeating what you&#39;ve previously put out, the Global Occult Coalition has organized the evacuation of civilians from dangerous sites.
&gt; 
&gt; **GOC Operative:** That&#39;s right, the GOC is here to defend you! If you can, find a way to get to one of our evacuation sites. If you can&#39;t, stay inside and barricade yourself with whatever- OH SHIT A CHAIR!
&gt; 
&gt; //(The GOC Operative and several more soldiers draw their weapons and unload them into a nearby dining chair until it&#39;s reduced to scraps. Maria keeps her head down until it&#39;s over.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **GOC Operative:** It&#39;s over, we&#39;re safe now.
&gt; 
&gt; **Maria Henderson:** That was the bravest thing I&#39;ve ever seen!
&gt; 
&gt; **GOC Operative:** Just doing our job ma&#39;am. Nothing stands in our way of protecting humanity!
&gt; 
&gt; //(The Operative holds his weapon to his chest and gazes off into the distance. An eagle is heard screeching from somewhere in the background.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Maria Henderson:** Truly you&#39;re going to be the saving grace of humanity! I can think of no better-
&gt;

This when all the TV and internet went-a down. How will Pizzaro get his orders now?

&gt; With all the food-a here Pizzaro could survive for years. But Pizzaro still-a has the order for Site 19! And Pizzaro never fails to deliver! Hope they understand Pizzaro cannot-a do pineapple! 
&gt; 
&gt; When Pizzaro was-a boy in Italy, Papa was-a pizza chef. Is a family business you see? Then one-a day this American Tourist come. He say he want-a pineapple! He threaten to leave-a bad review if Papa did not-a do so!
&gt; 
&gt; So Papa put-a the pineapple onto the pizza. When he was-a done he cried for months! Everyone in Italy shunned-a him, and Papa died of sadness not long after.
&gt; 
&gt; That&#39;s when Pizzaro knew. An Italian chef cannot put-a pineapple on-a pizza, it-a go against his very blood.
&gt; 
&gt; Pizzaro could-a never recover in Italy. So Pizzaro move-a here to America where Pizzaro can show these people real-a pizza!
&gt; 
&gt; But-a now the world is being destroyed. And Pizzaro don&#39;t-a know if he can make this delivery. But Pizzaro must try! Pizzaro has never failed before!

**Context:** Pizzaro found-a some Foundation peoples after leaving the shelter. They-a being very weird.

&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; //(Pizzaro sees some Foundation soldiers. Nine in a line, the Commander is walking in front of them. They look like MTF Emerald-9 (&#34;Villagers&#34;).//

&gt; **Commander:** (to first soldier in line) Performing the test.
&gt; 
&gt; **Soldier #1:** //(affirming villager noise)//
&gt; 
&gt; //(The Commander takes out a photograph and holds it up to the soldier. The soldier looks directly at it, there is no reaction.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Commander:** You&#39;re cleared.
&gt; 
&gt; //(The soldier nods. The Commander proceeds to hold the image to each soldier in the line in the same way, with no reaction from any of them. Until the eighth, who begins to sweat. He seems to sneakily lower his gun to cover his pants, but is noticed.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Commander:** //(shouting)// Got a live one!
&gt; 
&gt; //(The Commander and all other soldiers quickly aim their guns and fire upon Soldier #8, killing him. He drops to the ground. The Commander then moves to the ninth soldier and shows him the image - no visible reaction.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Commander:** Alright, we&#39;re clear. Move out.
&gt; 
&gt; //(MTF packs up their supplies and leaves the area, leaving the corpse of the dead soldier and the photo where it is.)//

**Closing Notes:** Pizzaro take-a look at the photograph. Was of-a very strange furry monster with-a wolf skull.

Pizzaro got-a to Site 19 and delivered the Pizzas to the Researchers. They did not-a seem human. Their eyes were-a missing something, they were talking about how to maximize how many people they-a killed, but most of all they did-a not even tip Pizzaro! 

So Pizzaro stole-a card from-a staff as revenge. Pizzaro use it to access their system so Pizzaro can check-a the website. But Pizzaro find-a timeline instead.

Why!?

What?

There&#39;s so many other entities to choose from. Fuck&#39;s sake there&#39;s a big blob that will literally turn into your ideal fantasy! Draw pictures of that!

It doesn&#39;t matter, we&#39;ve confirmed it. All this horrible stuff, the pictures, the hate, the stupidity. It&#39;s all the work of the banana.

Even if it wasn&#39;t I&#39;d still have voted yes.

Well whatever, let&#39;s just this omnicide started.

Think we can pull it off without anyone stopping us?

Not unless some obscene Italian stereotype sacrifices himself to put a bunch of pineapple on a big pizza and reset the timeline.

...And we&#39;re doomed.
