&#34;So, I don&#39;t think this is -- ah, well, given your [[[scp-3143|recent performance]]] -- I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s working out.&#34; 

Mr. Tuttle hated conversations like these. They always left him so flustered and uncomfortable. //Someone ought to invent a way of firing people without me having to talk to them//, he thought to himself as he twaddled with his tie. &#34;So, that&#39;s it, then. Uh, sorry. I&#39;ll need your security card, and we&#39;ll have to see you out.&#34;

&#34;This is literally the only purpose for which you exist,&#34; the deeply unpleasant man on the other side of Mr. Tuttle&#39;s desk replied. 

&#34;Pardon?&#34; The fellow wasn&#39;t moving to hand over his security card. Pity, that; Mr. Tuttle reached for the intercom that would summon the [[[operation-overmeta|Pataphysics Department]]]&#39;s extremely burly security team. //They could just automate it, couldn&#39;t they? Maybe with a robot. Give the robot a slot people could drop their security cards into. And maybe a taser, just in case.//

&#34;You&#39;re just here to fire me, you insipid dolt. That&#39;s why they created you. If they could automate this, they wouldn&#39;t have bothered.&#34; Dr. Thaum was the very sort of man who made Mr. Tuttle&#39;s job such a chore. English Literature Professors really were the worst. 

&#34;Right, then.&#34; Mr. Tuttle pressed down on the button. &#34;Marvin? I think I might need you and --&#34;

&#34;Also? It&#39;s twiddled. Not &#39;twaddled&#39;. //Also// also? You can&#39;t fire me.&#34; Dr. Thaum rose from his chair, throwing his security card down on Mr. Tuttle&#39;s desk. &#34;I quit.&#34; 

&#34;--and, oh. Oh, nevermind.&#34; Mr. Tuttle was almost disappointed. He had been looking forward to seeing Dr. Thaum squirming a bit on the floor while getting tasered. &#34;Alright, then. We greatly appreciate your years of service, and wish you the best of luck in the [http://tvtropes.org/ private] [https://www.fanfiction.net/ sector] --&#34;

&#34;Enough.&#34; Dr. Thaum&#39;s voice was flat and hard, rising to a

&#34;I said -- //enough//.&#34; His harsh tone only grew increasin

&#34;//Shut the fuck up!//&#34;
