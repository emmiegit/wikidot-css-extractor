**The Spinster-Queen**

TRUE TALES OF THE SPINSTER-QUEEN! ONLY IN THE NEW NEW ORLEANS TORCH!

The Spinster-Queen is a series of weird Western tales set in and around a post-apocalyptic Mississippi River. Society has rebuilt itself around the shining beacon of civilization that is New New Orleans, but in the far corners of the river&#39;s wildest reaches, threats still lurk...

**Part 1:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/recollections-contraband The Recollections of J. White] 

[[collapsible]]

This was my third tale. Talk about a genre shift! The truth is, though- this is an idea partially reflected in a lot of other failed drafts I wrote between I Stared and Growing Apart. I struggled a lot with how to follow my first tale up, and experimented heavily with a lot of different ideas- before, finally, coming to rest on this. I&#39;m not complaining- I enjoyed writing this!

That being said, it currently has a measly number of upvotes compared to my vastly inferior Growing Apart. So either I&#39;m doing something very, very wrong, or it&#39;s just too long for people. Who knows? Insofar as it doesn&#39;t go negative, I&#39;ll keep writing!

Sometimes, relationships simply die a slow and quiet death.

Yeah, I&#39;ve got nothing to say here. This one just isn&#39;t too great. I wanted to get over my fear of posting mediocre articles- and posted a mediocre article in doing so.

A weird, Rat&#39;s Nest-esque tale about a D-Class doctor.

This was my first article- and what a first it was! After weeks of slaving away on my terrible, terrible first idea for an SCP, a burst of inspiration struck me- and I wrote, revised, and published this in the span of a day. I&#39;m still proud of it.

[[tab About Me/FAQ]]
Hey! I&#39;m Long Arm Larry- Larry for short- and welcome to my author page. He/him. 

Q: Could you review my idea/draft/paean to Bal-Guzub, the True King?

A: If you send me something, at a bare minimum, I&#39;ll give you my basic thoughts on it. If what you&#39;ve sent me particularly interests me- or I have indebted myself to you on a dark and windy night we both dare not speak of- I&#39;ll take a further look, although no promises.

Q: What interests you/how do I place you in my debt?

A: I&#39;m a sucker for:

* Grounded articles that take a realistic angle to the Foundation/the world it inhabits.
* Apocalyptic articles- in setting or in tone. 
* Tales. If it&#39;s a tale, send it to me.

If you&#39;re unsure- or it&#39;s not stated here, but you&#39;ll think I&#39;ll like it based off of what I&#39;ve written- just send it.

NOTE: I tend to not be a fan of articles that are overly comedic in tone, or that are based mainly on a random pop culture reference. If you send one of these to me, I&#39;m probably not going to give the best feedback.

B: If you&#39;ve taken a look at one of my drafts (and you&#39;ve performed the necessary rituals) it&#39;d be rude not to return the favor. Send me anything- of any length!

Q: I want to collab with you!

A: I tend not to be a huge fan of collabs. I have a very idiosyncratic style, and I very much prefer to work alone- but, if you really feel like I am an absolute MUST on your given team/article/project, feel free to send me a message.

Q: I like something you&#39;ve written. Can I write something in the same universe/with the same characters?

A: Who am I kidding?

Q: Your &#34;about me&#34; is a sentence. 

A: Gangstalker.

Q: Infinite Jest (1996)?

I have a lot of random drafts of uncertain quality lying around. I don&#39;t want to go out of my way to request crit for these, but I don&#39;t want to completely abandon them either- so I&#39;ve randomly picked one to display here. If you feel like giving crit, please, let me know what you think!
[[/div]]

I am relaxing in my parents’ foyer- the day after graduation. A book sits, idly, upon my lap.

The doorbell rings.

It’s a sharply-dressed man, in a suit and a tie. I am talking to Harry here, yes?

We’ve heard of your talents. We have an offer for you. A job opportunity.  

    Eyes close.

----
Eyes open.

I am in an orange jumpsuit, being shepherded down the hall by two armed guards. It is lined with cell doors. Faces peer out from inside- hungry faces. Angry faces.

I am stopped outside a cell with one other occupant: an aged man, his face hungrier and angrier than the rest. 

This is your stop. In you go.

I stumble, as the door is locked behind me.

    Eyes close.
----
    Eyes open.

    I am in the cafeteria. The tables are dismal, the food even more so- “tasteless” would be charitable. 

    A group of gazes is set upon me. My cellmate is among them. 

    They have gaunt, haggard faces. Lean limbs. A plentitude of scars.

    Vicious eyes. 

    Eyes close.

----
    Eyes open. 

    They set upon me in the hallway. My mouth muffled, my eyes blinded. I struggled- it did little.

    I am now in a dark and unfamiliar cell. The bars have been obscured with sheets. I sit upon an uncomfortable chair, bound.

    I hear scraping on the concrete behind me. The individual scrapes are long, and protracted.

    My cellmate moves to the front. He is wielding a misshapen chunk of metal, stained with blood. 

    He bends to the floor- and continues scraping. Sharpening. It has an edge, the chunk. 

    I am sweating. 

    The scraping stops. He stands up- and for the first time throughout the entire process- meets my gaze.

    The cold press of metal, against my neck.

   &#34;Normally, we wouldn&#39;t be doing this,&#34; he says. &#34;We don&#39;t forget things as easily as you. But today, we have a problem. One you can help us solve.&#34;

The press is harder, now. Much harder.

  I know nothing. I know less than nothing. I tell them about what I remember: my days at the university, the strange man with an offer. Then here. 

    He steps back for a moment, assessing me.

    The blade is removed from my neck.

    He toys with it, picking at a fingernail.
 
    I am offered a choice. One of the options leads to a significantly more obvious fate.

    Eyes close.
----
    
    Eyes open.

    My first assignment is to watch. A week ago, there was just one of them. Just one. He was a friend of my cellmate. He went out for a test, and came back, quote, &#34;this way.&#34;

    Then- the next day, at lunch- there was two of them. Another man. Didn’t &#34;talk right&#34; - didn’t &#34;walk right&#34;.

    Then a third, then a fourth.

    Now, nine sit in the cafeteria. Not eating. Just sitting. They do not speak. Their expressions- when not twisted imitations thereof- are blank and featureless.

    One of them coughs. A spray of black dribble coats the table. 

    Eyes close.

----
    Eyes open.

    Why not tell the guards? Why not just alert the relevant authorities?

    &#34;We tried,&#34; he says. &#34;We tried. They think it’s just- retribution. Gang stuff.&#34;

    Is there anyone higher, I ask? Some more reasonable authority- inclined to see the truth at play?

    Eyes close.
----
    
    Eyes open.

    Mandatory psychiatric evaluations. They happen every two weeks. The next is in three days. They will listen. They know what to look for.

    They take up two tables in the cafeteria, this time. Sixteen, I think. Seventeen. The precise total eludes me.

    I am not alone, now- not alone with my cellmate, and his group of haggard men. More friends of the affected. People say it happens at night, when they’re alone. 

    They are afraid. They are afraid of my cellmate, too- but more afraid of them, now.

    Eyes close.
----

    Eyes open.
    
    My cellmate stands at the door, rebar in hand.

    A scream. Then another. 

    Eyes close.

----
    Eyes open.

    One of the guards walks- oddly. His step is a little unsteady.

    Their number has doubled. Close to doubled, at the very least.

    The cafeteria resembles an armed camp. They do not bother to sit anymore. They simply stare- with rictus smiles.

Eyes close. 
----
Eyes open.

    The evaluations are today.

    The guards are gone. The doors are unlocked, and open. 

    I hear screams. My cellmate hands me the piece of rebar. He, himself, wields the metal shard.

    They do not bother with subtlety anymore. If they find you alone, they take you. 

    We gather a small group of our own. Some have taken to barricading themselves within their cells. Only a few are still willing to fight.

    We move through the cell block. Cautiously. Slowly. We create a formation- my cellmate takes the lead, with two of his more burly companions close behind him. I take the rear. 

    We are not far from the exit, now- where the guards will take us. To salvation.

    Then, out of a darkened hallway. Five of them. Grinning. Smiling.

    They bare their teeth. Droplets of ink- or what seems to be ink- splash to the floor.
    
    They do not bleed. They do not bruise. One loses his heart, and continues to move.

    At the end of it, all but my cellmate and I have fallen. I am relatively uninjured, but he is covered with bites and scratches- black fluid oozing from the wounds, as well as blood.

He slumps- collapses. He is not long for this world.

    He urges me on. He does not want me to see it happen to him.

Eyes close.
----
Eyes open.

    I am in a clean, well-kept office. 

    He sits across me, in a chair- a friendly man in a lab coat and spectacles.

    “Do you feel... sad, D-78575? Depressed?”

    I do not feel depressed. I feel threatened.

    Concern, in his eyes.

    “You feel threatened?”

     I tell him about the smiles- the grins, the teeth. How they walked. How they lied; how they killed. How they took half the cell block. How I was one of the few left, now. 

    He stands up, and sighs- his back to me.

    This is not some half-hearted attempt at directing violence through an official body, I say. This is a threat! Real and genuine! One that presents a serious hazard to life and--

    He turns to me, a grin on his face.

    The guards- faces obscured by visors- stumble towards me.  

    I push past them. I sprint- full-bore- back to the cell block.

    Eyes close.
----
    Eyes open.

    There is something growing from the corpses. Rivulets of it spring out from cuts and wounds-- carpeting the floors and climbing the walls. Where many fell- now exist great blobs of it, midnight-black in color. They reach, slowly, to as-of-yet uncolonized corpses.

    Several of them have their eyes open. They smile at me.
    
    Eyes close.

    Eyes open.

    I feel a tap on my shoulder. 

    It’s my cellmate.

    Sirens sound.

    In the end, I join him.
