|| 6118 has long hair now, I guess. Dunno if it&#39;s going to stay. I&#39;m going to see if I make 6118 grow its hair out in the UnHuman series; I, too, am growing out my hair. Just a little. So that I&#39;m not completely bald. ||

[[image https://i.imgur.com/2Knj9Rx.jpg]]
|| Based on [https://open.spotify.com/track/2pTnasibfxSW1dXhljWByn?si=1f4732a8aae441c4 this song], that was intended to be for a different character, but I heard it and I was like... oh, I&#39;m Drawing This Now. ||

[[image https://i.imgur.com/TwViXeT.jpg]]
|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/oh-lord Oh, Lord...] ...Okay, I should probably actually say something about the art, too. It started out as a little sketch and then bam, it kind of just existed and now it&#39;s a Thing. I&#39;m proud of this Thing, moreso than my other Things actually. ||

|| This is a reference to 29/4/2020, when SCP-6118 crashlanded on earth and was taken into the Foundation&#39;s custody. I took heavy inspiration from the album cover of [https://open.spotify.com/album/7qkgFXQ5SAxDLHN2tJmECG?si=5472f34ec7904fc7 Pillows &amp; Therapy], specifically the song [https://open.spotify.com/track/0UhWFmdlrBSmZ7A6bFD8L9?si=a6e32f6e62b647ec C&#39;est la vie] (Spotify links). I had the idea to draw this for a while, but hadn&#39;t tried a colour palette or art style like this before. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. NO MORE AMONG US JOKES. I KNOW THEY LOOK LIKE THEM I KNOW.||

|| Based on the song Bleed Magic ([https://open.spotify.com/track/3kwKL0TkuPdt4kpAyaBezI?si=d580f88d373d48e7 This is a Spotify link]) because it fits them well. Also, I like the colours. Did you see what I did there with the iDKHOW logo? ||

|| This is also on my Scratch (albeit, extremely pixellated). People had... interesting reactions to it. ||

|| This was inspired by 24-05txt on tumblr (Ōmukade#1118 on Discord), he made a really great drawing of [https://24-05txt.tumblr.com/post/677638462231461888/id-two-images-both-a-digital-fullbody-drawing Murderbot in its cubicle], and I used the pose for reference. He gave me [https://discord.com/channels/745070369517600888/949153954237931551/951693099376181268 permission over Discord] (link only works if you&#39;re in TMBD 2.0) to rip his amazing design for 4-toed SecUnit feet, which I intend to use for 6118 of course. ||

|| When I showed this to grilled_cheese, she said &#34;it looks like someone dropping their kid off at school&#34; -- the people of TMBD 2.0 also agree. I find that to be a hilarious take. This is a reference to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/rapid-departure-ii Rapid Departure II] when they leave the Foundation for the first time. ||

[[image https://i.imgur.com/69nUpMt.png]]

|| I wanted to try drawing 6118&#39;s face in a more face-like way. I&#39;m bad at doing that digitally so here&#39;s the first and possibly only traditional drawing I&#39;m going to put here, because I don&#39;t like how my traditional art turns out. This is supposed to serve as a reference for what its face looks like, because I don&#39;t really illustrate that in much detail. Very neotenous. Except it&#39;s not an adult, so would it just be juvenile? I don&#39;t know. ||

|| I know, I know, I already drew 6118 floating in water. But I like this one better. This time it&#39;s actually swimming. I used [https://www.pinterest.com/pin/656258976963731981/ this random photo of some girl floating in water] for reference. That&#39;s where I got the idea for socks. Are swimming socks a thing? ||
