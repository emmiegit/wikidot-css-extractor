**Description:** SCP-7771 is a non-anomalous abstract concept used to explain the likelihood (or lack thereof) of any given event. While numerous predictable factors affect the probability of a given event, the sum of their effects adds a degree of uncertainty that cannot be accurately predicted. The common term for this concept and the associated uncertainty is &#34;luck.&#34;

**PARTIES PRESENT:**
* Overseer Council

**FOREWORD:** On January 1-2, 2005, a series of extremely unlikely structural and technical failures within Sites-19 and -77 resulted in cascading containment breaches in both Sites, a combined total of over 100 casualties and fatalities, and the narrow prevention of a K-class scenario resulting from the breaches. In the aftermath of these events, an emergency Overseer meeting was called to discuss possible methods of preventing similarly improbable and unfortunate events in the future.

**O5-1:** As I’m sure you have all read up on the events of the last 72 hours, today’s meeting has one purpose: to decide on a course of action to prevent disasters of this scale from happening again.

**O5-9:** But, the disasters were averted?

**O5-3:** The problem is that they //almost// happened, Nine, and we only barely avoided a Broken Masquerade in the aftermath, or worse. In any case, most of the problems, and similar problems we&#39;ve experienced over the last year, weren’t caused by human error, just natural factors we have little to no control over. We can’t control the weather, for example. 

**O5-10:** We //[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1948 could],// just not practically.

**O5-9:** How are we supposed to mitigate that risk further than we already have? We funnel as many resources as we can into training and containment technology, and a simple policy change can’t account for random chance.

**O5-5:** I have a proposition.

= //&lt;There is a pause in discussion.&gt;//

**O5-1:** Well, spit it out, Five.

**O5-5:** The very nature of our organization’s work is to contain the uncontainable. To hide away the most dangerous objects this universe has to offer.

**O5-7:** Your point being?


**O5-5:** Our work is, by definition, //unlucky.// The more Keter-class anomalies we cram into a site, the more likely they’ll eventually break out.

= //&lt;The O5s murmur in agreement.&gt;//

**O5-3:** We already have fail-safes and backups, Five. Nuclear warheads and highly trained security personnel, AICs and emergency response systems.

**O5-5:** Exactly my point. As Ten said, we //could// control the odds, just not practically. So, we’ll need some help.

**O5-1:** What //exactly// are you proposing, Five?

**O5-5:** We have //already// bent the natural laws of this universe to our whim for the purposes of our organization. I propose we commandeer another cosmic force.

**O5-12:** …You’re not saying–

**O5-5:** I see my dear Twelve has already figured it out. We have bent Death to our will, why stop there? If we could somehow manipulate the odds outside of a few policy changes and equipment upgrades, we could make Site-19 invincible no matter how many Keters we stuff in it.

**O5-1:** Five, you’re proposing we contain–

**O5-5:** Lady Luck herself, precisely, One. If we can’t control the amount of times we roll the dice, then we have to get the odds on our side. The house //always// wins.

= //&lt;The O5s discuss.&gt;//

**O5-13:** This is absurd, Five! We absolutely cannot alter a non-anomalous law of the universe.

**O5-9:** And, if this little project goes haywire? What then?

**O5-12:** We have [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3936 Exclusionary Sites] for a reason, Nine.

+ __PROJECT LOADED DICE__

[[/=]]

**PURPOSE:** To develop a method of reliable artificial probability manipulation to the benefit for the Foundation.

**ABSTRACT:** Foundation policy has historically focused on preventing and mitigating accidents and disasters through redundancy, failsafes, and personnel protocol rather than altering the fundamental probability of unfavorable events. Certain contained anomalies are capable of such probability manipulation, proving it to be possible and capable of directly affecting Foundation operations. 

**METHOD:** The primary focus of Project Loaded Dice is the study, utilization, and replication of anomalies capable of altering probability or luck. Research Area-8 is to be established within 250 kilometers of Site-01. The research and experimentation involved in Project Loaded Dice are to take place exclusively at this area. Temporary housing and containment facilities are to be built for all personnel, humanoid anomalies, and objects used in the project. A substantial budget is to be at the project’s disposal until its success or failure as deemed by the O5 Council. Any anomalies required for the project are to be approved for transfer from other Foundation facilities.

**OBSERVATIONS:** Attempts to study and replicate SCP-503&#39;s effects have been made throughout the span of its containment. SCP-503 is to be immediately transported to Foundation sites believed to be under imminent threat of mass containment breach or destruction.

**RESULT:** No attempts to reverse-engineer or replicate SCP-503&#39;s effects have been successful. Usage of SCP-503 as a means of affecting luck of endangered sites halted after Site-47&#39;s emergency failsafes experience unexpected failure during a containment breach, allowing SCP-503 to survive but allowing multiple aggressive entities to escape the site entirely.

**OBSERVATIONS:** SCP-738 was asked &#34;What would you want in exchange for the safety of all Foundation sites and personnel, and the prevention of all scenarios that directly endanger them, without altering normalcy or consensus reality?&#34;

**RESULT:** Price stated to be &#34;The human capacity for self-determination.&#34; Price deemed unacceptable.

**Result of Neutralization Attempt:** SCP-001-SWANN entities are compelled to create events with an absolute certainty to happen/not happen to the benefit of the Foundation. However, due to suddenly having to deal in universal absolutes, SCP-001-SWANN entities are overwhelmed in having to manage other minor events (such as nuclear fission) rather than continuing human consciousness. This causes an EK-Class End of Human Consciousness Scenario which eventually develops into a ZK-Class Reality Failure Scenario.

**O5-4:** And, if she isn’t convinced?

**O5-11:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dap-orientation We have other methods.]

**O5-1:** How do you even intend to convince her, Five and Twelve?

**O5-12:** By doing what we do to every god we mess with. We play on her hubris.

POI-777 has seemingly total control over the probability of events, even being able to &#34;will&#34; events into happening. Observations of POI-777 seem to suggest she has influence over events happening universewide, being able to intervene if she so chooses. In essence, POI-777 is capable of nearly anything she desires by simply manipulating the odds of an event happening to be absolutely certain. As such, POI-777 is considered extremely dangerous.

**O5-██:** Of course. “Luck” doesn’t exist. It’s simply how our feeble human minds deal with mathematical probabilities. I lost my bet not because I was “unlucky,” but because of the slight movements in the dealer’s fingers when he rolls the ball and spins the wheel. Or, the tiny discrepancies in the air temperature around the ball, creating different magnitudes of air resistance.

= //&lt;O5-██ places another $15,000 on 18 red. POI-777 places $25,000 on 2 black. The croupier spins the wheel.&gt;//

**POI-777:** Sure, “luck” may only exist in concept, but you really don’t believe that some people or things are more prone to these imperceptible differences?

**O5-██:** The expected probability of landing heads on a coin flip is 50%. Yet, flip a coin 10, 100, a thousand, even a million times, and it won’t be exactly 50/50. Those people just happened to land in the groups of 36 heads or 64 tails.

**O5-██:** By chance, those people, those numbers, those //superstitions,// they prime our brains into making connections. That’s what our brains do best. And, once you realize that luck doesn’t exist at all, and that it’s all about percentages and normal distribution, you get pretty comfortable testing the odds.

**O5-██:** How so?

**POI-777:** I bet I can convince you.

**CROUPIER:** Double 0.

= //&lt;The croupier takes the pile of chips on the table and hands POI-777 $17.5 million in chips.&gt;//

**O5-██:** Coincidence.

**POI-777:** Maybe. But, it sure is damn coincidental I won the //one// time we switched bets, //I// made a gesture, //and// took a sip of my drink.

**O5-██:** You’re not saying–?

**POI-777:** &lt;to the CROUPIER&gt; I’d like to cash out now.

**POI-777:** Thank you.

**O5-██:** I don’t believe I’ve gotten your name?

**POI-777:** It’s Tyche.

**O5-██:** Charmed, I’m [DATA EXPUNGED].

**POI-777:** A pleasure.

**O5-██:** &lt;gestures&gt; Shall we?

= //&lt;O5-██ and POI-777 proceed to leave the table in the direction of the Casino Bar and Lounge. MTF Alpha-1 follows closely.&gt;//

**POI-777:** You see, Mr. [DATA EXPUNGED], “luck” isn’t entirely a man-made concept. A man of science like yourself would see it that way, no doubt.

**O5-██:** Hm.

**POI-777:** Things in this world aren’t always exactly as they seem, [DATA EXPUNGED]. There are... things that cannot be explained. Maybe even //special// people out there with //special// powers. The myths of old have to be explained by //something.//

**O5-██:** I’ll believe it when I see it. Even then, //everything// can be explained with science. If not, then it’s an unknowable law of the cosmos that us humans must accept we’ll never know.

**POI-777:** That is not the nature of humanity. Humans //must// know everything. For example, &lt;gestures towards a slot machine&gt;

= //&lt;The player at the slot machine POI-777 gestured towards immediately wins the maximum prize listed on the machine.&gt;//

**POI-777:** Or, &lt;gestures again towards a game of craps&gt;

= //&lt;The shooter at the game rolls “snake eyes” which result in defeated groans at the table.&gt;//

**COMMAND:** Anomalous abilities confirmed, O5-██.

**POI-777:** Even the fact that– &lt;gestures&gt;

= //&lt;All five members of MTF Alpha-1 simultaneously bump into five separate waiters holding drinks.&gt;//

**POI-777:** –I now know where your men are.

= //&lt;After assisting the waiters, MTF Alpha-1 makes their way towards O5-██ and POI-777, procuring their concealed weapons.&gt;//

**O5-██:** &lt;to ALPHA-1&gt; Stand down. Do not engage.

= //&lt;MTF Alpha-1 stops.&gt;//

**POI-777:** &lt;smiles&gt; Now, Mr. [DATA EXPUNGED], if my memory is correct, you “do not believe in luck”?

= //&lt;O5-██ is silent.&gt;//

**POI-777:** Why would a “man of science” like yourself be accompanied by five military trained guards to talk with some random lady at a casino?

**O5-██:** &lt;hesitates&gt; &lt;To ALPHA-1&gt; Disperse.

= //&lt;MTF Alpha-1 disperses through the crowd.&gt;//

**POI-777:** That’s what I thought. What is it you want, O5-██?

= //&lt;O5-██ and POI-777 are seated at a booth in the very back of the Casino Bar and Lounge. O5-██ is drinking a glass of whiskey neat, while POI-777 enjoys a lemon ouzo cocktail. O5-██’s earpiece is placed on the table between the two of them.&gt;//

**POI-777:** Certainly kind of you to treat me to a cocktail before whatever interrogation is about to happen.

= //&lt;O5-██ is silent.&gt;//

**POI-777:** I know your men are still around. I happened to see them in the reflection of your glasses.

**O5-██:** &lt;hesitates&gt; I represent an organization known as the SCP Fou–

**POI-777:** I know who you are, //jailor.// Do you think this is the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3480 first] I’ve heard of your so-called “Foundation”?

= //&lt;O5-██ takes a sip from his drink.&gt;//

**POI-777:** Of course you do. I expect nothing less from a man with your ego.

**O5-██:** Then you know what we’re trying to accomplish, yes?

**POI-777:** Of course. You intend to use my powers for your own benefit.

**O5-██:** It’s a bit more complicated than that.

**POI-777:** Then, do tell.

**O5-██:** Like us or hate us, we are the last line of defense against this world’s downfall. If you weren’t aware, the world almost ended a few months ago.

**POI-777:** I knew that.

**O5-██:** Then, why didn’t you use your powers to stop it? It was caused by pure chance, we weren’t at fault for it.

**POI-777:** Because unlike you I do not pervert the natural course of this world with what or how I think things should be. Humans are capable of incredible things, but they fail to realize they are an insignificant speck in the unknowable cosmos you claim to believe in and impose your will on.

= //&lt;POI-777 takes a sip from her cocktail.&gt;//

**POI-777:** And, as far as I can tell, there’s only //one// god at this table.

= //&lt;The two sit in silence.&gt;//

**O5-██:** A lot of talk from someone we found manipulating the odds to get rich.

**POI-777:** I hardly believe defrauding a casino is at all equivalent to the //modus operandi// of your organization. Besides, a goddess gets bored.

**O5-██:** An entire civilization dedicated altars to you, performed rituals in your name, many were devoted to //you.// They created art, stories, offerings. The mythology they wrote about you is //still// being told thousands of years later today. You really don’t think that too contributes to an inflated ego?

= //&lt;POI-777 glares at O5-██.&gt;//

**O5-██:** Your powers caused you to cease aging. But, you can still die. And, frankly, with a lifespan as long as yours, I bet a bit of //luck// had to do with keeping you alive. I assure you your luck //will// run out.

= //&lt;POI-777 is silent for a few moments before bursting into uncontrollable laughter. This goes on for a few minutes, to the annoyance of O5-██.&gt;//

**POI-777:** &lt;laughing&gt; Wait, wait, wait! I’m so sorry! //My// luck? Me? The //goddess// of fortune? //I// will //run out// of luck? &lt;laughing even harder&gt; That is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard!

= //&lt;POI-777 continues laughing for a few more minutes before finally calming down.&gt;//

**POI-777:** C’mon, c’mon, let&#39;s get this over with! I have some more games to play. What is it you want?

**O5-██:** If you join our organization, you will have a seat at the council. You will get to make decisions on how to keep this world living, as well as many unimaginable benefits.

**POI-777:** Sorry, not interested.

**O5-██:** We can ensure your continued existence.

**POI-777:** No matter how effective of an organization like yours is, this universe //will// come to an end eventually. Even if you last until then, if there is nothing left for you, there is nothing left for me.

**O5-██:** Please–

= //&lt;POI-777 begins to stand up.&gt;//

**POI-777:** Thank you for the drink, but I have to get going now.

**O5-██:** &lt;sighs&gt; Then, you leave me no choice.

**POI-777:** Hm?

**O5-██:** A boon.

= //&lt;POI-777 sits back down.&gt;//

**O5-██:** I //want// a boon.

**POI-777:** “Win by persuasion, not by force.”

**O5-██:** And, did that go so well?

= //&lt;POI-777 is silent.&gt;//

**O5-██:** A bet. I want to make a bet.

**POI-777:** Ha! Your funeral!

= //&lt;O5-██ is silent.&gt;//

**POI-777:** Oh, you’re serious? Okay. What kind of bet?

**O5-██:** A game–

**POI-777:** There are plenty around us. What will it be? Roulette? Blackjack? Craps?

= //&lt;O5-██ produces a Smith &amp; Wesson revolver from his jacket pocket, just far enough for POI-777 to see.&gt;//

**O5-██:** Russian roulette.

= //&lt;POI-777 appears shocked and dumbfounded.&gt;//

**O5-██:** Don’t worry. You’re not playing.

= //&lt;O5-██ loads one bullet and hands the gun to POI-777.&gt;//

**O5-██:** You can check that the gun is indeed loaded.

= //&lt;POI-777 examines the chamber and hands the gun back.&gt;//

**POI-777:** That it is.

**O5-██:** The rules of the bet are simple. After every trigger pull against my head, I will load in another bullet and spin the chamber. You are free to manipulate the odds as you see fit. If I survive until the end, you have to join the council and help us. If I don’t, well… you know. The game ends when the gun goes off.

**POI-777:** You’re mad.

**O5-12:** Be patient, One, they’ll be arriving shortly.

**O5-1:** &lt;frustrated&gt; Well, you and Five’s little //experiment// isn’t boding much confidence in me. We took a huge risk with her, and it better pay off.

**To:** O5-1, O5-2, O5-3, O5-4, O5-5, O5-6, O5-8, O5-9, O5-10, O5-11, O5-12, O5-13
**From:** Containment Committee, Department of Health and Security, Department of Internal Affairs, Department of Logistics and Asset Management
**Subject:** Official Complaint Regarding O5-7

**NOTICE:** This memorandum has been sent through reality stabilizing means.
-----

This is a memorandum to the Overseer Council written jointly by the Heads of the Containment Committee, Department of Health and Security, Department of Internal Affairs, and the Department of Logistics and Asset Management.

We are raising our concern over the appointment of O5-7 on 04/06/2005. In the time since her appointment six months ago, we have noticed an unusual and alarming rise in the number of incidents the Foundation has experienced. Below are some of the statistics our various departments have reported:
* 65% increase in the number of successful D-Class escapes,
* 27% increase in the number of incidents involving anomalies in containment,
* 5.3% decrease in site efficiency,
* █ Euclid/Keter class anomalies breaching containment since appointment,[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Most of which were approved for cross-testing by O5-7 or per O5-7&#39;s precedent.[[/span]]
* Neutralization of █ probability-affecting anomalies.
* ██ personnel injuries higher than average,
* No change in personnel’s adherence to protocol.

Additionally, the destruction of Research Area-██, resulting in ██ personnel being terminated, is still fresh in our minds. An investigation into the incident found the cause to be a shipment of bad concrete which went unnoticed for █ years. This is an extremely rare occurrence for an organization as thorough as ours.

A majority, if not all, of the incidents were caused by random chance or “bad luck.” While we do not have any direct evidence, we suspect that the Foundation’s recently poor performance is due to sabotage on O5-7’s part. The correlation between her appointment and the start of these incidents is just too blatant to be written off as coincidence. As such, we are urgently calling for her removal from the council as her current position is a detriment to the Foundation. We hope you take our concerns seriously.

{{[17/12/2005]}}

**PARTIES PRESENT:**
* Overseer Council (sans O5-7)

**FOREWORD:** In response to the official complaint from four department heads regarding effects on Foundation activities possibly caused by O5-7, an emergency session of the O5 Council sans O5-7 was called to discuss potential courses of action. 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
= **&lt;BEGIN TRANSCRIPT&gt;**
-----
= //&lt;Twelve of the council members are seated in Site-01’s main meeting room.&gt;//

**O5-1:** I’m sure you have all seen the memo sent to us by multiple department heads.

**O5-5:** This is ridiculous.

**O5-12:** I have to agree with Five.

**O5-13:** Of course you would! It was you two that got us in this mess.

**O5-2:** And, now you want us to stay in it?

**O5-12:** Seven is //not// a problem.

**O5-2:** You saw the statistics, right, Twelve?

**O5-12:** I did.

**O5-2:** And, you have nothing to say for it?

**O5-12:** They //have// no evidence. As far as we can tell, it could’ve been caused by the previous O5-7’s death or even GOI sabotage.

**O5-3:** …That //is// unfortunately true.

**O5-13:** Unbelievable, Three!

**O5-3:** I’m forced to see things as they are, Thirteen.

**O5-2:** The statistics–!

**O5-5:** Are unsubstantiated and frankly ambiguous. They cannot directly connect O5-7 to these statistics, and one new Overseer out of thirteen //cannot// cause this much damage to an organization that has existed for over a century.

**O5-13:** She’s //not// a normal Overseer.

**O5-3:** Says the anomaly.

= //&lt;O5-13 glares at -3.&gt;//

**O5-5:** Removing an Overseer is an extremely drastic move, and we have all made decisions that angered the others before.

**O5-13:** Such as this project.

**O5-5:** &lt;sternly&gt; //However,// Seven has only been on the council for six months. She could very well be leaving this rough patch.

**O5-10:** Do you trust that?

**O5-12:** Never judge a book by its cover, Ten. Out of everyone I thought you would know this.

= //&lt;O5-10 scoffs.&gt;//

**O5-1:** Enough! If I am correct, everyone is confident in their opinion of O5-7?

= //&lt;The O5s are silent.&gt;//

**O5-1:** Exactly, no further deliberation is needed. Honestly, this infighting gets aggravating, and I like us to remember that we make the decisions, not the department heads. As such, O5-7’s removal from this council will be put to a vote. All in favor?

**O5-1, -2, -4, -9, -13:** Yea.

**O5-1:** All opposed?

**O5-3, -5, -6, -8-, 11-, -12:** Nay.

**O5-1:** O5-10 abstains. The measure fails. O5-7 will remain on the council.

**O5-13:** Fools, all of you. Fools, playing into her hands!

**O5-12:** We are not removing an Overseer based on a //hunch,// Thirteen.

O5-13,

The documents you have shared with me are extremely concerning and have been forwarded to the rest of the Ethics Committee. As a consequence of O5-7&#39;s active and indisputable sabotage, her continued presence on the council will be put to a vote by this committee. However, while I thank you for the notice, the council&#39;s actions as a whole in this project will also be examined closely.

+ **TASK FORCE REPORT (ONGOING)**

**Date:** 21/12/2005
**Site:** RA-8, 01, 06-3, 17, 19
**MTF(s) Involved:** Alpha-1 (&#34;Red Right Hand&#34;); [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tanhony-s-proposal Omega-1 (&#34;Law&#39;s Left Hand&#34;)], Fireteam ALPHA and BETA; Omega-12 (&#34;Achilles&#39; Heels&#34;); Epsilon-11 (&#34;Nine-Tailed Fox&#34;)
**Personnel Involved:** O5-7
**Ordering Body:** Overseer Council, Ethics Committee

**Planned Action(s):**
* Forcefully discontinue Project Loaded Dice
* Terminate O5-7
* Revive and reinstate the previous O5-7
------
At 8:11 AM, MTF Omega-1 (“Law’s Left Hand”) Fireteam BETA enters Research Area-8, encountering no resistance. All personnel are accounted for and sent to Site-██ for reassignment and amnesticization. Fireteam BETA secures all physical project materials, documents, and anomalies for extraction.

At 11:00 AM, all present Overseers save for O5-1, -7, and -13 discreetly exit Site-01 with MTF Alpha-1 (“Red Right Hand”) escort, while O5-1 and -13 enter the secure bunker and seal it behind them. O5-7 is not notified of either event. At 11:07 AM, an unannounced sitewide lockdown is initiated. At 11:12 AM, MTF Omega-1 Fireteam ALPHA and MTF Omega-12 (“Achilles’ Heels”) enter Site-01 with orders to intercept and terminate O5-7[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Onsite Kant counters reported the local Hume level suddenly rising by ~20 Hm at this moment before dissipating to normal.[[/span]]. Onsite elements of MTF Alpha-1 are ordered to protect the bunker exclusively and to not engage with other personnel. At this time, O5-7 remains in her office, not notified of the lockdown or arrival of Mobile Task Forces.

At 11:18 AM, MTF Omega-1 secures the camera control room. One member of Omega-1 is injured by a falling ceiling tile. No cause apparent. MTF Omega-1 reports seven additional injuries resulting from accidents and improbable occurrences, such as falling bricks, broken bones from slipping, and others. Zero recorded fatalities.

At 11:23 AM, simultaneous containment breaches are reported at Sites-06-3, -17, and -19. MTF Epsilon-11 (“Nine-Tailed Fox”) is mobilized to respond to these breaches. Presumed related to ongoing action at Site-01. By order of O5-2 and -9, half of onsite MTF Omega-12 personnel are reassigned to guard the Overseers from potential ontokinetic attack. Fireteam ALPHA and remaining MTF Omega-12 personnel continue into Site-01.

Fireteam ALPHA and MTF Omega-12, now ███ feet from O5-7’s location, approach the hallway containing the Overseer’s office. As they round the corner, all members of MTF Omega-12 simultaneously complain of dizziness, nausea, and severe headaches. All members collapse within minutes, with Fireteam ALPHA unable to revive them. Medical team dispatched to their location. Fireteam ALPHA is ordered to continue into the site by COMMAND, with assistance affirmed by several nearby Mobile Task Forces.

At 11:28 AM, Fireteam ALPHA assembles outside of O5-7’s office, who remains typing at a terminal. At this time, Site-01 experiences an electrical blackout, with backup generators failing to power more than the Site’s terminals and database. Fireteam ALPHA don night vision goggles and attempt to shoot O5-7 through the wall, but all provided weapons malfunction. As Fireteam ALPHA troubleshoots their weapons, several negligent discharges occur which strike other personnel. Only one member is left unharmed. O5-7 is unharmed. Full power is restored to the facility, which temporarily blinds the single member of Fireteam ALPHA. As they recover, the single member of Fireteam ALPHA enters the office to terminate O5-7. However, a weapon malfunction (presumably caused by an incomplete discharge) causes the member’s firearm to explode. This injures the member, resulting in significant damage to the hands and bleeding. 

The single active member of Fireteam ALPHA attempts to engage O5-7 with a knife. O5-7 unharmed. Surviving member&#39;s vital signs destabilizing; presumed incapacitated. 

Further support from nearby Mobile Task Forces, including MTF Alpha-1 and Omega-12, are en route.
