= Welcome to the **SIMULACRUM** Project.

Regardless of your clearance, status, appearance, and/or previous history, we would like to extend our appreciation and thank you for your attendance -- willingly or not. 

Our world is continuously expanding and evolving; however, our organization remains stagnant. The intake of hundreds, if not thousands of anomalies has exhausted Foundation resources and manpower for decades. Again and again we attempt to circumvent the inevitable, but still fall short every time. With no clear solution in mind, the Foundation has simply turned its head and remained as a reactionary force -- pretending that its overwhelming size and authority could simply tough through until the end. 

But those methods are no longer effective. 

Now, it is our turn to evolve, using every resource at our disposal. The **SIMULACRUM** Project is dedicated to three core objectives: efficiency, control, and expansion. As of now, we are responsible for **[##ff243c|13,650,045##]** users, spread across **[##ff243c|362,458##]** environments currently hosted by the **SIMULACRUM** infrastructure.

By the end of 2100 this number is projected to reach well into the billions, encompassing most -- if not, all -- of the human population.

But there is still much work ahead of us before we can ever achieve that goal. Cyberspace has plenty of unique and dangerous wonders that we have yet to unravel. Many obstacles still stand in our path before the **SIMULACRUM** Project can be completed. Luckily, however, we have dedicated people like you. Those who are willing to fight through the tough battles and ensure that our vision can be seen to its absolute conclusion.

[[=]]
We are ecstatic to have you with us, and expect many great things -- do not let us down.

[[tab Overview]]
Hello again! Welcome to **SIMULACRUM**, a universe/project created by [[*user JakdragonX]]. It&#39;s great that you&#39;re here! I&#39;m sure you have several questions about both what this universe looks like and how it functions, so let&#39;s go through the basics.

**SIMULACRUM**, at its very core, is an expansive, interconnected network of Foundation-operated simulations hosted through advanced paranormal technologies and complex network infrastructure. Said simulations can take a variety of different forms: whether acting as replicas of our physical world, a fantasy realm with alternate laws of physics, or even another canon. The technology necessary to host **SIMULACRUM** is  predominantly centralized to Site-119, however that doesn&#39;t mean other Sites aren&#39;t capable of connecting and utilizing it.

**SIMULACRUM** has three fundamental goals to the Foundation once it&#39;s fully complete:
# Providing them with the ability to maintain the Veil by migrating humanity into a &#34;non-anomalous&#34; simulated world(s), once **SIMULACRUM** is fully complete.
# Granting full control of reality as it&#39;s perceived within their simulations, either to mitigate anomalies or to alter humanity&#39;s perception in case of emergency.
# Establish and create new sandboxes that can be used to either contain new anomalies, develop and create anomalies, or safely isolate themselves for other purposes, such as [[[scp-2744|training]]] [[[scp-4523|new Foundation personnel]]].

While these are certainly not the //only// things that **SIMULACRUM** encompasses, they are core to its overall themes of control, isolation, and expansion.

[[/tab]]
[[tab Frequently Asked Questions]]
Have further questions? Refer below to see if any of these help you with finding an answer!

+++ How does **SIMULACRUM** work?

As mentioned in the Overview, **SIMULACRUM** is just a bunch of simulations that are layered together. While interpretations of how one accesses **SIMULACRUM** are unique between articles, the universally accepted method is through &#34;jacking-in&#34;, whether that be through [[[/scp-7766|a pod inside Site-119]]] or from some other virtual reality device strapped to a user&#39;s head.

The simulations hosted through **SIMULACRUM** can be as open or constricted as needed to convey a story. While mostly acting independently from one another, &#34;simulations-within-simulations&#34; and &#34;top-down simulations&#34; are heavy elements within this universe and should be used to add dimension and depth to an article.
 
+++ What does **SIMULACRUM** look like?

Externally, SIMULACRUM looks like a typical computer network, albeit fitted with anomalous technology or the occasional paranormal .AIC. Nodes across different Sites and data centers are connected to each other via physical/wireless connections, which are all used in conjunction with another to display or host **SIMULACRUM** simulations.

Inside **SIMULACRUM**, it&#39;s entirely dependent on what simulation you&#39;re in! As an ordinary user, you might not be able to distinguish any differences. As an operator or administrator, you could fundamentally alter the landscape, environment, or even other people inside **SIMULACRUM**. Again, it all depends on your circumstances within the simulation and its intended function(s).

+++ Does the Foundation control everything?

In terms of &#34;Does the Foundation control **SIMULACRUM**?&#34; the answer is yes. **SIMULACRUM** is managed by the Foundation.[[footnote]]More specifically, it is managed by Site-119 and their internal leadership, who reports to Overwatch Command.[[/footnote]] 

But in terms of anything outside of **SIMULACRUM** the answer is no, the Foundation can&#39;t control everything. Technology isn&#39;t perfect, and very often it&#39;s prone to unexpected and complex errors that can result in devastating or [[[scp-7311|interesting results.]]]

+++ Are there any stakes in **SIMULACRUM**?

Yes, there are stakes and risks associated to **SIMULACRUM**. A classic example is that [[[/scp-7313|dying in a simulation means you can still die in real life]]].[[footnote]]This doesn&#39;t //always// have to be the case, but it&#39;s certainly prevalent in many articles.[[/footnote]] System and technology failure are also heavily used to introduce dangers to the Foundation and the **SIMULACRUM** at large.

Anomalies are also still a [[[/scp-6872|danger in the physical world]]] of **SIMULACRUM**, even moreso than in other universes or interpretations of the Foundation.

+++ Does everything have to be simulated?

No, it doesn&#39;t. 

**SIMULACRUM** is a universe split between a Foundation-inhabited physical world and then all of the other simulated worlds. While these two certainly interconnect between each other in their own unique ways, they are also entirely independent. If you do not wish to write about simulations, and instead wish to focus more on the physical element, that&#39;s both completely okay and encouraged!
+++ Can multiple universes exist? How does that work?

Yes, multiple universes can certainly exist within **SIMULACRUM**. In fact, its very nature is to allow other universes to cross into it (you can simulate anything you want with enough creativity, after all). Multiple events can all happen simultaneously, whether it&#39;s due to it occurring between two distinct simulations or in simulations-within-simulations. 

+++ How are **SIMULACRUM** simulations connected?

Simulations are connected via **SIMULACRUM** infrastructure, which is [[[scp-7311|intended to replace SCiP.net as the Foundation&#39;s Site-wide intranet]]]. As such, **SIMULACRUM** servers and data centers are sporadically placed across Earth in different Sites -- most notable of which includes Site-01 and Site-119.

[[/tab]]
[[tab Glossary]]
Here&#39;s a quick glossary to help you stay up-to-date with any terms that you might find while reading through **SIMULACRUM:**

* **SIMULACRUM:** Network of interconnected simulations used by the Foundation to facilitate anomalous containment and eventually maintain the Veil.
* **Instance:** A case or occurrence of something, such as an object, element, person or simulation.
*  **Simulation:** A virtual copy or imitation of physical reality utilizing digital resources or technologies.
* **Sandbox:** Any simulation or virtual reality that can be freely altered and edited by a host player.
* **Player:** A user interfacing with **SIMULACRUM**. 
* **Permissions:** A set of rules defining how a player or user can use certain objects or specific technologies.
* **Privileges:** Elevated permissions granted to specific users typically for accessing, executing, and/or reading data.
* **Variables:** A representation of something within a simulation, allowing it to be edited or configured by others.

[[tab Writing Guide]]
Are you considering writing something for **SIMULACRUM**? If so, great! There&#39;s not a whole lot that needs to be done; however, there are a few things you should be made aware of.

Before doing anything else, //read!// There are plenty of articles that you&#39;re free to explore and use as inspiration. I would personally begin with reading [[[scp-2744|TATTLETALE]]], as it really helps jumpstart you into the overall tone and theme(s) of **SIMULACRUM**. After that, try reading any of the other articles! Most don&#39;t require any previous reading and all capture their own unique elements within **SIMULACRUM**.

Once you&#39;ve done some reading, it&#39;s time to write! You&#39;re free to write however you&#39;d like. You don&#39;t have to include any established characters, articles, themes, or events -- but you&#39;re free to reference if you&#39;d like. You may also use the [[[/theme:new-age|New Age Theme]]], but again it&#39;s by no means mandatory.

Simulated fiction -- or any type of fiction that involves simulated or artificial worlds -- has a variety of themes and elements to explore. While not necessary to have a complete and exciting story, there are several themes in particular you can consider when conceptualizing your SCP article or Tale for **SIMULACRUM**:
* Virtual vs. Physical Reality: What makes these different? What makes them unique? How would someone be able to interact between these two and describe their experiences? All of these questions are significant to **SIMULACRUM** and moreover important to your reader, who may have to determine that distinction for themselves.
* Escapism: The idea of living inside of a simulation at someone else&#39;s control may be terrifying to some. Trying to escape from a hellish world, on the other hand, could scare others. Consider these when exploring **SIMULACRUM** and it&#39;s uses -- after all, what if one of //your// characters need to escape from something?
* Life Inside a Simulation: What do //you// think living in a simulation would look like? Would you be able to tell? Or others? Consider the environment and how it might play a role in leading your protagonist/antagonist to their climax and conclusion. 
* Control: Who&#39;s pulling the strings? Who&#39;s the one being controlled? **SIMULACRUM** allows for a broad network of top-down authority. You can explore the benefits and negatives of such a system, or perhaps introduce a new perspective into how the Foundation (or the users underneath them) seize control.
* Faulty Machinery: Technology is always prone to errors. People grow too comfortable and eventually this leads to things breaking. What might this look like in **SIMULACRUM?** If a server goes down, for example, what are the ramifications for people living in a simulation? What happens to the system operators who might also be jacked into the system?
* Isolation: Living in a simulation all by yourself seems lonely, doesn&#39;t it? What about being the only operator left in the physical world? Isolation and loneliness are heavy elements to this universe, feel free to explore how your characters might react to being isolated from their friends and family!
* Abstraction: The **SIMULACRUM** universe is expansive and layered. Multiple simulations may work in tandem with each other, or possibly overlay themselves onto one another. This abstraction of different **SIMULACRUM** simulation layers could result in unique and peculiar discoveries that are worth exploration. What do //you// think would happen if you lived in a simulation within another simulation?

While the above aren&#39;t required for a **SIMULACRUM** story, they should atleast provide you with some ideas to consider. Keep in mind, again, to //read// the other entries in **SIMULACRUM**! You may uncover an unexplored idea that you can expand and grow upon.

Additionally, you&#39;re always free to contact [[*user JakdragonX]] for further help, either through Wikidot PMs or Discord (JakdragonX#0012).
