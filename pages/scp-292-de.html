[[include component:image-block name=Ostern.jpg|caption=Drawing of SCP-292-DE, made after the description of a witness, who is supposed to have seen SCP-292-DE on 03/04/1999.]]


**Item #:** SCP-292-DE

**Object Class:** --Keter-- Uncontained

**Special Containment Procedures:** As of the date of this report, SCP-292-DE is considered uncontained. MTF DE6-ùîà (6-Emil &#34;Elmar Fudd&#34;) is tasked with reviewing media reports and reports from medical facilities serving rural villages, settlements, and suburbs during the period after Easter Saturday, looking for reports that mention unexplained medical changes, especially if they involve sugary materials. Reports of unexplained, sudden stench should also be checked.¬†¬†¬†

If these reports confirm SCP-292-DE or SCP-292-DE-A activity, MTF responders shall be dispatched to the affected locations, take SCP-292-DE-A victims into custody, and seize all chocolate eggs in the location to eliminate possible confusion. The residents are to be treated with amnestics afterwards. 

Victims of SCP-292-DE-A, after consuming SCP-292-DE-A, shall be transported to the nearest base in quarantine for three days for observation, examination, and medical attention. After three days, depending on the nature of the physical alteration, the affected subjects will either be treated with amnestics and reintegrated back into society or transported as anomalous individuals to Site-DE17 for permanent containment. All witnesses and closer relatives of the affected subjects are then treated with amnestics.

**Description:** According to current research and witness reports, SCP-292-DE is a figure resembling a cuddly toy bunny made of dark gray burlap. The body parts are said to be sewn together with thick brown threads, and several places on the body are covered with colorful egg-shaped patches that are said to represent Easter eggs. On the face, it has a black and brown button eye on the left only, the right ear is partially torn off, and SCP-292-DE&#39;s mouth has been sewn shut. The size of SCP-292-DE varies between 20 cm and 2.30 m, depending on the testimony of the witnesses. If it is the same object or if there are further copies of SCP-292-DE is unknown at the moment.

SCP-292-DE is capable of independent locomotion, preferring to move on its hind legs, although its stride is described as relatively staggering. When it is on its four paws, it can reach speeds of up to 80 km/h[[footnote]]The top speed of a field hare.[[/footnote]], leap up three times its current body size, and even jump five times far to escape quickly in an emergency. SCP-292-DE possesses some degree of higher intelligence and probably some sort of precognition that it uses to sense potential danger. 

On the evening before Easter Sunday, SCP-292-DE appears near various rural settlements, villages or suburbs north of the 51st meridian in Germany, where Easter is celebrated. At which places SCP-292-DE appears is, according to current knowledge, arbitrary[[footnote]]Current research aims to identify possible appearance patterns.[[/footnote]].

During the evening before Easter Sunday,¬†¬†SCP-292-DE will materialize near its destination, where it will try to enter one of the gardens or houses on the outer edge of the settlement, where the tradition of the Easter egg hunt is celebrated. 

Once at the desired destination, it will tear open one of its patches and take out from it a copy of SCP-292-DE-A, which it will either hide directly on the spot or smuggle into an existing Easter nest. After successfully accomplishing this, it will hide behind the nearest larger plant[[footnote]] Usually a tree or shrubbery, but in one case it hid behind a pot of a larger yukka palm. [[/footnote]] hiding and dematerialized shortly thereafter.

SCP-292-DE-A is a filled milk chocolate egg encased in plain aluminum. The color of the foil varies, as does the filling, which is contained in the chocolate. Visually, the eggs do not differ from conventional chocolate eggs. The general taste of SCP-292-DE-A has been described by concerned subjects as ordinary, even sometimes as bland or old.

If SCP-292-DE-A are not found and consumed within three days, a strong odor reminiscent of rotten eggs develops, making the chocolate inedible. The odor intensifies until SCP-292-DE-A is either completely decomposed[[footnote]]Which can take up to three months.[[/footnote]] or it has been destroyed by combustion.

The actual anomalous effect occurs after consumption of SCP-292-DE-A. Subjects who have consumed SCP-292-DE-A suffer a two-stage change in their body, depending on the flavor of the filling.¬†¬†

Within the first hour, parts of the body insidiously begin to conform their structure or properties to the ingredients or properties of the added ingredients[[footnote]]Such as bony structures changing to sugar crystalline.[[/footnote]].

Although this should usually be fatal for the affected subjects, bodily functions continue as usual and so far no deaths of affected subjects are known. However, these subjects find the changes unpleasant, psychologically distressing, frightening, and in some cases extremely painful. The first phase lasts about two days.

On the third day after consumption, the second phase of changes begins. During this phase, the changes of the first phase dissolve, exposing the manipulated or new body part. This is completely healthy and even proves to be significantly improved in comparison to the condition that existed before the consumption of SCP-292-DE-A. In some cases, these are improved in ways that are impossible for normal people to achieve[[footnote]]See the attached logs for details on this.[[/footnote]]. Affected subjects feel more vital and better than before after completing the transformation. The effects of the second phase are so far permanent and irreversible. 

--Affected subjects, however, also feel strong aversion to chocolate and feel strong nausea in the immediate vicinity of it.-- Affected subjects showed strong physical aversion to the filling they consumed, and the mere proximity of substances that remind them of it makes them feel strong nausea. Whether this permanent aversion to it is due to a psychological traumatic caused by the experience or whether it is part of the abnormal effects of SCP-292-DE-A is currently part of further research. 

Tests revealed that the initial aversion to chocolate was due to the fear that it might be filled with the filling they consumed [[footnote]]This phobia can be cured after intensive psychological care, so that the affected subjects still found chocolate disgusting but could consume it again as long as it was not filled with the substance that reminded them of the filling.[[/footnote]].

**Discovery:** Reports about SCP-292-DE exist since 1946, but due to the remote location of its apparitions they were rather insufficient and could be confirmed only in 1967. SCP-292-DE-A came into the interest of the SCP Foundation in 1971, which listed the object as SCP-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà-DE.

For the next few years, researchers tried to find out how the objects got into the localities, but without significant success. It was not until 1990 that SCP-292-DE was accidentally captured by a private security camera placing an instance of SCP-292-DE-A into an existing Easter nest. SCP-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà-DE was then reclassified as SCP-292-DE-A and merged with SCP-292-DE.

**Summary of some more significant SCP-292-DE events**.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Date:** 04/15/1979.

**Location:** ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, Saxony

**Subject:** Girl, 13 years old.

**Involved filling:** Cotton candy.

**Progression Stage 1:** Within a few minutes, the subject had first felt a tingling sensation in her gums, which increased more and more and later began to hurt severely. Within hours, the subject&#39;s teeth took on a crystalline shape, which turned out to be sugar crystals. These began to splinter more and more without outside interference, making the pain unbearable for the subject. 

Due to the fracture of the crystallized teeth, the subject bled profusely from the mouth, however, something seemed to prevent it from bleeding out. After all the teeth were destroyed after one day, the child felt painful pressure in her jaw bones pressing against the gums.

**Result Stage 2:** On the third day, new teeth grew back in the subject. The subject felt no pain and experienced a strong pleasant sensation in the mouth area, as well as strong hunger after starving for the previous two days. The teeth proved to be more resistant and stronger. This is made possible by an additional layer that coats the teeth and also protects them from dental diseases such as paradonthitis or caries. Attempts to take samples of the teeth and the layer on top failed because all dental equipment, including several dental drills and forceps, broke during the operation. The teeth remained undamaged. 

**Current Status:** Subject and family were treated with amnestics. Subject was reintegrated into society as there was no acute threat to secrecy. Semiannual dental examinations are performed by a physician who works undercover for the Foundation.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Date:** 04/21/1981

**Location:** ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, Brandenburg, Germany

**Subject:** SCP-292-DE-A was not consumed in time.

**Indicated filling:** Not available, subject was found after the expiration date of SCP-292-DE-A.

**Result:** A strong smell of rotten eggs had formed in the garden of the ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà family. Despite an intensive search, the family could not find the source of the stench. The stench became stronger over the following days and continued to spread. Within three days, the family had to leave their house because the air was unbearable. A week later, the entire village was affected by the stench and had to be evacuated. 

The MTF sent to the site was able to find SCP-292-DE-A in a tree cavity of the apple tree located in the garden and destroy the object by incineration in a special container. A cover story about a faulty sewage system was developed as the reason for the stench. After reenacting restoration work, the residents were able to move back in a week later.

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
&gt;
**Date:** 20.04.1990

**Location:** ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà near Berlin

**Subject:** Boy, 7 years old. 

**Indicated filling:** Nougat

**Progression Stage 1:** Affected subject exhibited increasing abdominal and chest pain within half an hour of consumption, followed by severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The final product excreted in this manner had a different consistency and odor than usual. Upon closer examination, it was identified as liquid nougat. Investigations were able to prove the existence of abnormal intestinal bacteria which, for unknown reasons, convert the consumed food into nougat. Despite the severe physical discomfort and extreme change, the body itself showed no damage.

**Result Stage 2:** On the third day after consumption and complete emptying of the gastrointestinal tract, the boy felt completely healthy again. Examination of the intestinal tract showed a mutated version of intestinal bacteria that greatly improved digestion and showed regenerative properties on the intestinal tract. 

**Current Status:** The family has been administered amnestics drugs. The subject is examined twice a year by a country doctor who works undercover for the Foundation.

**Special feature:** A security camera recorded SCP-292-DE hiding SCP-292-DE-A in an Easter nest for the first time. It was thus confirmed that the two objects were related. The recordings were confiscated.

&gt;
**Date:** 04.04.1999

**Location:** ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany

**Subject:** Adult male, 43[[footnote]]He had taken SCP-292-DE-A from his son after discovering that it contained alcohol. [[/footnote]]

**Indicated filling:** Eggnog.

**Progression Stage 1:** The subject showed initial signs of drunkenness such as increased self-esteem, lowered inhibitions, and increased aggressiveness [[footnote]] within half an hour. He allegedly made sexual overtures to his wife and sister-in-law during Easter and verbally assaulted his brother-in-law and stepfather.[[/footnote]], dizziness, unclear slurred speech, and a euphoric mood.[[footnote]]He later stated that the chocolate egg had been the only alcoholic thing he consumed that day.[[/footnote]]. 

As the day progressed, the symptoms worsened. Loss of physical coordination, nausea, vomiting, disorientation, strong urination and headaches followed. Blood tests revealed, in addition to traces of sugar and eggs, an alcohol level that would usually be lethal to the human body, but except for the typical symptoms of simple alcohol poisoning, the body showed no major effects. This condition lasted for two days.

**Result Stage 2:** After a severe hangover on the third day, the subject felt better than ever. Examinations of blood values as well as organs showed that the liver, kidneys and spleen were working much more effectively and filtering the blood better. As a result, the subject had developed immunity to toxins and other harmful substances affecting the blood, including alcohol. The subject no longer felt the intoxicating effects of alcohol or other intoxicants and painkillers. However, other drugs absorbed by the blood were also shown to be absolutely ineffective.

**Current status:** Due to his immunity to amnestics, the subject is in custody at location DE17. As a cover story, an affair was mentioned with which he would have secretly eloped.

&gt;
**Date:** 04/16/2017

**Location:** ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, near Bremen

**Subject:** Boy, 10 years.

**Indicated filling:** White milk cream.

**Progression Stage 1:** Within half an hour, the subject became aware of cracking sounds in his fingers, which slowly but steadily continued to spread, causing severe pain. As the day progressed, the pain continued to spread with each movement and the cracking sounds increased in intensity. The limbs would bend in an unnatural way and shortly thereafter become stiff again. The parents, unable to explain this, then drove the child to the nearest hospital. 

In the end, the subject could not move without some part of his body cracking and hurting. 
Examinations of the bones at the hospital revealed that they had been replaced with milky sugar crystals that broke when moved and grew back together within a few seconds. Despite the theoretical resulting damage, the remaining parts of the body remained undamaged for unknown reasons. 

**Result Stage 2:** By the third day, the subject&#39;s body had returned to normal. However, before the Foundation could arrive and take the subject into custody, he escaped from his room and ran out of the clinic. On the street in front of the clinic, the subject was hit by an approaching ambulance. Despite the tremendous force that caught the subject, the subject suffered only shock and bruises and isolated abrasions. 

A subsequent examination revealed that the subject&#39;s bones were coated with an unknown layer that gave the bones additional stability and hardness without sacrificing flexibility. It was even found that this layer could regenerate damage to the bones within seconds.[[footnote]]The subject, however, experienced an increased appetite for milk and dairy products as well as other potassium-containing products in return. [[/footnote]] 

**Current Status:** Subject was taken to site-DE17. Parents were administered an amnestics and told a cover story that their child died from undetected internal bleeding sustained in the accident. 

At the time of this writing, the subject is being counseled as to whether his abnormal characteristics and athletic talent would make him suitable for intra-foundation training and later assignment to a mobile task force.

**Audio-Log SCP-292-DE**

**Foreword:** The audiolog contains the testimony of Egon Meiss, a witness who, according to his own testimony, was the first to make eye contact with SCP-292-DE and the first to consume a copy of SCP-292-DE-A on April 21, 1946. On the day of the encounter, he was seven years old and living with his aunt and siblings in ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, Mecklenburg.[[footnote]] The village was dissolved in the 1980s and is now a closed-off area.[[/footnote]] 

According to his testimony, he would have kept it a secret until a few years ago, however, recently he often told his family and the residents and staff of the nursing home in ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, where he currently lives, about his &#34;encounter with the Easter Bunny&#34;. No one believed his tales and it was assumed that these were signs of dementia until Agent Sch√ºllers, who was at the home just to visit her mother, became aware of them. Agent Sch√ºllers, who works for MTF DE6-ùîà, became suspicious because the description of the &#34;Easter Bunny&#34; and the events that followed bore strong similarities to SCP-292-DE. 

With the approval of her supervisor and Dr. Heuyer, the principal investigator of SCP-292-DE, Agent Sch√ºllers took Mr. Mei√ü&#39;s statement on April 21, 2019. 


[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

&#34;I remember that day as well as if it were only yesterday. Times were hard. The war had only been over for a short time. I came with my siblings to live with my aunt, my father was hauled off to the Soviet Union, and my mother died of an illness during the war. 

At that time we had to gather the remaining beets and cabbage in the sparse fields. The harvest was poor and most of it was confiscated by the Soviets. Times were really hard, we were hungry and we had nothing but destroyed fields, a ruin to live in and the torn clothes on our bodies. But we had the will to live.

We knew it was Easter, but we gave up that we could look for colorful eggs like we used to. We didn&#39;t even have a chicken that could lay eggs, not to mention candy. And chocolate even less. We were lucky if we could survive the next winter, unlike my little sister Anne.

Then, the night before Easter, I woke up. I had to get out and pee. We only had the outhouse outside. So I got up, quietly snuck out and went to the bathroom. After I was done, I heard a strange rustling noise from outside. I was afraid it was a wolf or a red. But at the same time, I had been very curious. So I opened the door just a little crack and carefully peeked out.

There I saw him! In the light of the moon! Only a few meters away! The Easter Bunny himself, even if he looked quite different than I imagined him. More like an old cuddly toy than a real bunny. And the mouth, which was sewn up with him, was already creepy. But it was definitely the Easter Bunny! Never in my life will I forget him. Without ears he had been certainly as tall as I, with ears a head taller. The linen was almost white. Not quite, more like dirty snow. With eyes made of black buttons. And he walked on his thick little legs like a drunken Soviet. 

But the most striking thing was the big patch on his chest that looked like a colorful Easter egg! I knew then that it could only be the Easter Bunny! I watched him for a while and saw him pull off the patch and reach into his chest. He pulled out of it a dark egg, which he placed behind a tree stump. 

Then something apparently startled him. His gaze turned to me and he looked in my direction with his black beady eyes. I could still see him bringing his paw to his sewn-up mouth, as if to tell me not to say anything. Then he sat down on all four of his paws and...WUSH! Like the wind he ran away!

When he was gone, of course I ran to the tree stump where he had hidden the egg. But it was not a normal egg. It was made of chocolate! I ate it immediately. It was, for me, the sweetest and best thing I&#39;ve ever eaten. And the last sweet thing.

After I snuck back and went back to sleep, my heart had suddenly started pounding like crazy. It felt like it was about to burst out of my chest. I had only been able to breathe violently. I had felt dizzy all over. I had been sweating and hardly noticed anything afterwards. It was a blur. My chest had hurt. I wanted to scream, but I couldn&#39;t breathe. I saw everything blurry. I was so hot and nauseous. My vision was blurry for two days. I saw my aunt and my siblings looking at me worriedly. They were scared. I was scared.

And I had been coughing. Over and over again. But it wasn&#39;t blood or saliva. It looked like... Like chocolate. Like melted chocolate. And it tasted like it. So brown, thick with little solid chunks. That taste that sticks in your mouth. The feeling of it sticking in your throat. How it felt like my chest was full of it and it was sticking everywhere. It was so disgusting to me. I will never forget it. Ever since then, just smelling chocolate makes me sick. 

But three days later, I woke up early in the morning. The taste and the feeling were gone. I was healthy! I was fine. I was feeling better than I had ever felt before! I could breathe in really deeply. The air was so fresh and delicious. My aunt had just come to visit us with the doctor, who lived three days away from here, but I was well again. The doctor had declared my aunt and me crazy and left again. 

Since then I had never had any problems with my breath. Never pneumonia, no cancer, even though I smoked like a chimney. Not even a cold had I ever had. I never had! I could breathe all the time, everywhere. I could run like the wind without the air burning inside me. And I could even hold my breath underwater indefinitely. So back when we were learning to swim, everyone called me &#34;fish.&#34; 

I kept it a secret for so long. Nobody would have believed me anyway, not even my son, daughter or grandchildren. 

But it was so long ago. And I realize that my memories are slowly fading. But I will never be able to forget the Easter Bunny. Even though he had caused the worst time of my life, maybe he had also saved my life. 

If I could have one more wish.... 

I would thank him...&#34;

**&lt;End Log&gt;**
[[/div]]


**Addendum:** Medical examinations made on Mr. Meiss following the interview confirmed abnormal efficiency of both lungs and all parts of the body responsible for breathing. Among other things, he had been able to hold his breath for up to 30 minutes.¬†¬†¬†

However, since it would not have been possible to transport him unharmed to site DE17 due to his residual physical infirmities, it was decided, in consultation with Dr. Heuyer and the Ethics Committee, to leave Mr. Meiss at his current location. He was administered a strong amnestics, which left him in a state similar to dementia, to ensure secrecy. 

Six months later, Mr. Meiss died of acute meningitis.
