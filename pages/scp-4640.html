**Item#:** SCP-4640

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4640-1 currently resides in its home in Makawo, Maui County. Two field agents posing as Mr. and Ms. Feeks are to care for SCP-4640-1 while attempting to persuade SCP-4640-1 to provide them with SCP-4640-2. These attempts are to be gentle, non-confrontational, and intermittent (to avoid the manifestation of SCP-4640-3). Once per week, agents are to provide reports regarding SCP-4640-1 and its willingness to provide SCP-4640-2.

Additional agents are to monitor SCP-4640-1 discreetly to prevent SCP-4640-3 manifestations. Should SCP-4640-1 acknowledge Foundation monitoring, an SMK-Class &#34;One Versus Everyone&#34; Scenario[[footnote]]Such scenario would consist of SCP-4640-3 identifying the Foundation as a threat towards SCP-4640-1, and in response attempt to destroy it. This would, in return, lead to a Broken Masquerade/Breach of Normalcy scenario. Since no efficient way has been found to neutralize either object comprising SCP-4640, the entirety of the Foundation, along with any affiliated parties, would be considered to be at risk.[[/footnote]] could ensue.

--Tests will be conducted in designated Foundation safe-spots, where SCP-4640-1 will be taken to by the previously mentioned agents, which will be announced as family and/or school trips.-- All tests have been halted until further notice.

**Description:** SCP-4640 is the collective designation given to two entities currently linked via an anomalous item. Each of these elements has been subclassified as SCP-4640-1 through -3.

SCP-4640-1 is Andrew Feeks, an 11 year old male of native Hawaiian descent. SCP-4640-1 is non-anomalous; however, it is the owner of SCP-4640-2. Any attempt to forcibly remove SCP-4640-2 from SCP-4640-1 results in the manifestation of SCP-4640-3.

SCP-4640-2 is a yellow circular plastic pin with a stylized purple &#34;W&#34;. SCP-4640-1 claims that prior to owning it, neither the coloration or &#34;W&#34; were originally present. As of right now, SCP-4640-2 is attached on the upper-left side of a hoodie constantly wore by SCP-4640-1. When SCP-4640-2&#39;s current owner is endangered (physically, psychologically, or emotionally), it causes SCP-4640-3 to manifest.

SCP-4640-3 is a humanoid entity of muscular build, standing approximately 1.8m in height. SCP-4640-3 has dark purple coloration, with a golden &#34;W&#34; on its chest and yellow pigmentation on its hands, feet and pelvic area. It is also of note that, despite having the appearance of a human male, SCP-4640-3 does not posses any genitals or intergluteal cleft. SCP-4640-3 goes by the name of &#34;Wonderman&#34; and presents various anomalous abilities characteristic to classical super-hero tropes. These have been seen to include:

* Abnormal strength.
* Abnormal speed.
* Abnormal endurance.
* Being impervious to damage.
* Emitting light beams from the eyes at will.
* Amnestic capabilities.
* Healing individuals through direct skin contact.

When SCP-4640-3 manifests, it will go through any measures to protect SCP-4640-1, damaging structures and other living beings if necessary. SCP-4640-3 will also use its amnestic capabilities on SCP-4640-1 in order to eliminate any &#39;traumatic&#39; experience[[footnote]]What SCP-4640-3 considers as a possible traumatic event is currently unknown, although records show the entity amnesticizing SCP-4640-1 when the latter shows signs of sadness or fear.[[/footnote]].

It is theorized that SCP-4640-2&#39;s and -3&#39;s appearance are based off from SCP-4640-1&#39;s ideation of the concept of what a superhero is. However, both aforementioned objects share the branding color scheme of various [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/dr-wondertainment-hub|Dr. Wondertainment]]] products. Research into whether SCP-4640-2 is a Dr. Wondertainment product or if SCP-4640-1 has previous knowledge of the company is ongoing.

**Addendum 4640/1:** Discovery

SCP-4640-3&#39;s first recorded sighting occurred in the █████ Elementary High School, where it spontaneously manifested after a series of students laughed at SCP-4640-1 when it accidentally dropped its beverage on itself. SCP-4640-3 obligated the other students to apologize, followed up by amnesticizing SCP-4640-1 of the event. Foundation response teams were dispatched, amnesticized all witnesses and then catalogued the occurrence as an Extranormal Event.

A direct link to SCP-4640-1 was not made until 6/7/18, where it was reported that a &#34;Purple Superhero Saved Child from Deadly Car Accident&#34;[[footnote]]Cited from the local newspaper[[/footnote]]. The accident involved a gas truck colliding on the lateral side of a car being driven by Mr. and Ms. Feeks. All individuals involved, excluding SCP-4640-1, died in the event. SCP-4640-3 then amnesticized SCP-4640-1 and took it to a videogame store that the latter frequents.

**Addendum 4640/2:** Interview Log

[[collapsible show=&#34;Access interview log.&#34; hide=&#34;Close file.&#34;]]

&gt; **Interviewee:** SCP-4640-1
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Agent Hila (posing as the elementary school&#39;s psychologist).
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** The interview was conducted for the purpose of gathering information about SCP-4640-2&#39;s origin. SCP-4640-1 was told it was chosen at random for a psychological evaluation.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hila:** Hi Andrew. How&#39;ve you been doing lately?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4640-1:** I think I&#39;m doing fine. Why am I here, again?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hila:** Well, because I&#39;m still new around here. So, as a way to get to know you all a little better, I&#39;m doing evaluations at random, so don&#39;t be scared or surprised if you get called again in the future.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4640-1:** Oh, okay.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hila:** So, what do you think of yourself around here? Are you the nasty trickster that puts thumbtacks in other&#39;s seats? Or are you the one that likes to make everyone laugh with crazy sayings?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4640-1:** I uh... I guess I&#39;m just the quiet one.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hila:** Oh, that&#39;s totally fine! Not everyone needs a wacky personality. Actually, did you know people who are reserved are usually more intelligent?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4640-1:** Really?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hila:** Well, I&#39;m assuming so. You have such good grades afterall!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4640-1:** //chuckles// Thanks!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hila:** I assume you must be a creative person as well. I&#39;ve heard you like to doodle in your notebooks.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4640-1:** I do! Would you like to see some of them! Can I bring my math notebook? That one&#39;s got the most drawings.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hila:** Maybe later, Andrew. I noticed you have a rather interesting pin there, and it made me curious about your personal interests. Is it from a show?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4640-1:** It&#39;s not. It&#39;s a Wonderman pin!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hila:** And what&#39;s Wonderman exactly? Never heard that name.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4640-1:** He used to be just in my drawings, but since I got the pin he actually became real! He teleports to me whenever I need him!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hila:** Is that so? And where did you get it? I mean, who wouldn&#39;t want a personal superhero. I would like one too!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4640-1:** It came inside a plastic box in this weird cereal mom once bought. It was delicious, but she says she can&#39;t find more of it. My favorite part were the marshmallows. I&#39;m pretty sure they changed in color every time you closed and open your eyes, but mom told me she only could see them blue.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hila:** Perhaps she went to a store she normally doesn&#39;t go to?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4640-1** I don&#39;t know. She never told me. Hey isn&#39;t it weird she was the only one that bought the cereal? There&#39;s normally more boxes behind the ones you first see.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hila:** It does sound pretty weird. Maybe the cereal got discontinued or something. Oh would you look at the time! It&#39;s almost recess! Let&#39;s finish this chat for now. I&#39;ll see when we can meet together again. I got really curious about this &#34;Wonderman&#34; you mention. You&#39;re free to leave now.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4640-1:** Ok thanks! Bye Miss Yancy!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Hila:** Bye Andrew!
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Investigation into all supermarkets located near SCP-4640-1&#39;s residence has revealed that no personnel or written records evidence the existence of a cereal advertising the described features. However, security footage of Ms. Feeks analysing in a confused manner a Honey Nut Cheerios cereal box and then adding it to the shopping cart was found in █████████ ██████. Whether this footage has any relevance is still being debated.

**Addendum 4640/3:** Testing Log

[[collapsible show=&#34;Access test logs.&#34; hide=&#34;Close file.&#34;]]

The following is a series of failed attempts at obtaining SCP-4640-2. The list has been recently abridged. Consult Dr. Okoa for the complete testing log.

&gt; **Test #:** 1
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedures:** Agent Kiliwa and Gersh, posing as SCP-4640-1 parents, attempt to acquire SCP-4640-2 while it&#39;s asleep.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results** SCP-4640-1 is seen with SCP-4640-2 now attached to its pajamas. When attempting to remove the object, SCP-4640-3 manifested. The entity raised its right index finger up to its mouth and &#39;shushed&#39; at the agents until they left the room. Attempts at reentering the room were met with SCP-4640-3 remanifesting and repeating the process.


&gt; **Test #:** 5
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedures:** Agent Phoros poses as a substitute teacher and attempts to confiscate SCP-4640-2 from SCP-4640-1.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results** SCP-4640-1 responded by taking SCP-4640-2 from its hoodie and placing it inside its pocket, apologizing for wearing the object.

&gt; **Test #:** 6
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedures:** Follow up to previous test. Agent Phoros demands SCP-4640-1 to give her SCP-4640-2.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results** SCP-4640-1 reacts with fear, resulting in SCP-4640-3 manifesting. The entity then tells Agent Phoros to apologize, followed by the agent being forced verbally to sit at a corner of the class. SCP-4640-3 watched over the agent to prevent her from getting up until the schoolday was over.

&gt; **Test #:** 9
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedures:** An individual named Robert Frow (allegedly SCP-4640-1&#39;s &#39;best friend&#39;) is paid 10$ in order for him to ask SCP-4640-1 if he can borrow SCP-4640-2.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results** SCP-4640-1 responded with a &#34;no&#34; without further comment.

&gt; **Test #:** 10
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedures:** Frow is told to use his 10$ to buy SCP-4640-2 from SCP-4640-1.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results** SCP-4640-1 explicitly told Robert to get away from him.

&gt; **Test #:** 16
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedures:** Agent McKelson, posing as a clerk at a grocery store SCP-4640-1 often visits, attempts to convince SCP-4640-1 to give him SCP-4640-2 in exchange for any confectionery of his liking.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results** SCP-4640-1 turns down the offer, indicating SCP-4640-2 is &#39;more valuable than candy&#39;. Despite no danger or offense towards SCP-4640-1 having been made, SCP-4640-3 still manifested, adding to the former&#39;s comment that &#34;eating too much sugar is bad for [SCP-4640-1]&#39;s health anyways&#34;. The entity then gestured a &#39;thumbs up&#39; towards SCP-4640-1, which responded in the same manner.

&gt; **Test #:** 23
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedures:** Agents Kiliwa and Gersh walk with SCP-4640-1 towards an alleyway, where a staged mugging act (with D-9022 being the thief) will occur.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results** SCP-4640-3 manifested and punched D-9022 in the face, breaking its nose. D-9022 was rendered it unconscious. SCP-4640-3 then turns to face SCP-4640-1, exclaims the phrase &#34;I&#39;m the Wonderman&#34; in a lower pitched voice followed by its demanifestation.
&gt; 
&gt; Medical examinations on D-9022 revealed minor skull fractures in its front and back side. These appear to originate from the initial punch at its face and the subsequent impact with the ground.

&gt; **Test #:** 30
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedures:** D-9023 is instructed to walk unsuspiciously towards SCP-4640-1 and then steal SCP-4640-2 as fast as possible.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results** SCP-4640-3 manifested while D-9023 was at a meter distance from SCP-4640-1. It then grabbed D-9023 by the collar, stared at it in an intimidating manner and then threw it on the floor with excessive force. This resulted in various burst fractures along D-9023&#39;s spine.

&gt; **Test #:** 31
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedures:** D-9024 is instructed to walk unsuspiciously behind SCP-4640-1 and then knock it unconscious with the given baseball bat.
&gt; 
&gt; **Results** SCP-4640-3 manifests the moment the baseball bat makes contact with SCP-4640-1&#39;s head. SCP-4640-3 then takes the bat and breaks it in half, followed by SCP-4640-3 throwing the broken bat pieces at D-9023 with enough force as to have broken two of its ribs. SCP-4640-3 then turns to SCP-4640-1, heals it via anomalous means and then amnesticizes it of the event.

&gt; **Test #:** 32
&gt; 
&gt; **Procedures:** D-9025 is told to incapacitate SCP-4640-1 via shooting one of its legs from an area SCP-4640-1 does not have visibility of.
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** SCP-4640-3 manifested when the fired bullet was 10m short of connecting with its target. The bullet ricochet off when making contact with the entity, damaging a nearby building. SCP-4640-3 then redirected its line of sight towards D-9025 and fired a laser at its location, effectively killing D-9025. After a few seconds, SCP-4640-3 turns towards one of the hidden cameras recording the test and stares at it for a total of 5 minutes before attending SCP-4640-1 and demanifesting.

**Addendum 4640/4:** Incident Log

[[collapsible show=&#34;Access incident log.&#34; hide=&#34;Close file.&#34;]]

On 15/9/2018, SCP-4640-1 started experiencing a nightmare involving itself being pursued by a multitude of characters originating from various cartoon shows it watches[[footnote]]This was stated by SCP-4640-1 itself during a follow up interview.[[/footnote]]. This resulted in SCP-4640-3 manifesting at seemingly random locations, in an approximate radius of 6.5 kilometers from SCP-4640-1. The entity acted as if it were in combat with said characters, often using its anomalous capabilities to &#39;defend&#39; SCP-4640-1. In said attempts to &#39;defend&#39; SCP-4640-1, SCP-4640-3 displayed a large quantity of previously unknown abnormal abilities, some of which included: 

* Flight.
* Spontaneous generation and control over fire.
* Spontaneous generation and control over electricity.
* Generation of ice particles via exhaling.
* Manifestation of solid, translucent barriers.
* Self-duplication.
* Short-ranged teleportation.

This resulted in the destruction of multiple buildings, with a total death count of ██ and ██ injured. The rest of the surrounding populace at this point had woken up, most of which sought shelter while the remaining few attempted to record the event. 

Despite an additional SCP-4640-3 instance preventing the commotion from interrupting SCP-4640-1&#39;s sleep, Agents Kiliwa and Gersh managed to successfully wake up SCP-4640-1, resulting in the immediate demanifestation of all SCP-4640-3 instances.

Airborne amnestics were released and a fake memory of an earthquake was implanted. All recorded evidence of the event was destroyed, with copies currently being stored in the Video Archives.
