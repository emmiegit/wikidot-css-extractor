++ Prologue: 1884

The flesh of the goddess of memory was undercooked, but she ate it anyway. “How soon until…” she muttered.
O5-0 shrugged. “Apotheosis is a…confusing process. It could be seconds, it could be days.”

The two of them were alone in a room with no doors. The soft whispers of light from various candles filled this room, scratching glowing yellow on the walls of amber wood. In between them was a small table, with a plate in front of the woman and a glass of wine in front of 05-9.
“I don’t feel any different.” the woman murmured.
“That’s to be expected. I think.”
“How was it for you?” the woman asked, attempting to bury her nervousness.

O5-0 chuckled. “It was both the worst and the best experience of my life. Worst, because of the pain, but afterwards…it was beautiful. You’ll love it. You’ve earned this.”
“I have?” In that moment, the delicate facade of the woman broke, and from underneath, a scared little girl peaked through, only to be shoved down.

“Of course.” O5-9 responded. He brought the cup of wine to his lips.

“Wha…” the woman stopped in the middle of speaking as her eyes went white. She began to choke on air, before crashing onto the carpeted floor. Her skin melted as her body jerked about.

O5-9 simply took a sip of wine. “Don’t worry,” he said. “The darkness of today is in service of the light of tomorrow. You can die in the dark and still live in the light.”

+ Part One: Chaos

**The rusted chains of prison moons are shattered by the sun
I walk a road, horizons change
The tournament’s begun
The purple piper plays his tune, the choir softly sing
Three lullabies in an ancient tongue in the court of The Crimson King**

…

//On March 15th, 2019, 682, The Hard To Destroy Reptile, randomly turned into a dragon and broke free from containment. Security camera footage showed it doubling in size, breaking the walls of its cell, and sprouting wings. 682 then proceeded to fly away from the site, hot fire billowing from its mouth.//

//In order to stop 682, 5514, also known as the Dragon Slayer, was deployed. This massive mech engaged in a fight with 682 in the city of Chicago.//

//The dragon was defeated, but the mech then proceeded to go haywire and stampede across the city. As it did, black ooze fell out of it, similar to 6217, Emergence. Readings from the people inside seemed to suggest that it had somehow infected them. The reason why the mech had been infected was a mystery.//
_______
When the shadow of a dragon appeared over Chicago, the towers began to tumble.

It was not a fantastic situation to be a school bus driver in, especially since it was 3:06 PM. A chorus of screaming elementary school children quickly became the soundtrack for Devin’s attempts to steer the vehicle through the thunder storm of steel.

His mind rushed to find a place free from danger, but the situation was complicated by what looked like a large mech arriving from out of nowhere and swinging a massive glowing sword at the dragon. Devin could hear the metallic screeching of the mech’s limbs, and the shadow of the dragon&#39;s wings was splattered on the street. He was practically under the fight.

None of this situation made any sense, and all Devin’s mind could come up with was to get the bus as far away from the fight as possible. 

Unfortunately, he found his path blocked by a massive mountain of concrete in the middle of the street. His hands wrenched the steering wheel to the side, attempting to turn the bus around. Then, there was a metallic shrieking. Something had hit the bus. 
Next thing Devin knew, the world did a catapult as the bus was sent into the air. Crunch! The bus’s side slammed onto the asphalt with a scream of metal.

It took a moment for Devin to put himself back in reality. Images of his cat were tumbling through his mind. She definitely was not capable of dealing with an apocalyptic fight. It was a struggle for her to get out of a trash can. However, worrying about his cat would not help, his apartment was on the other side of the fight. Right now, he had to think about the dozen or so children on the bus.

“Is everyone okay?” Devin shouted as he managed to get himself onto his feet. Blood was pooling from his shoulder, and his arm appeared to be a tad bit too long.
The kid&#39;s response were to unleash an awful symphony of dissonant pain from their mouths. 

One kid pointed to a cracked window. “Dragon!” He shouted.
Looking through the window, it became clear the impact had come from the dragon, whose bleeding form was now draped over the block.

Despite the fact the dragon should have been dead, its wings continued to twitch slightly, smacking the puddle of green blood squirming out of its body. As interesting as this sight was, Devin felt that stopping children from dying was a bit more important than sightseeing. However, something strange then happened.

The green blood was suddenly joined by an obsidian black raining down on the street. This dripped from the mech, which was still moving, stomping endlessly above the city.

The black goop it bled landed in splotches everywhere. When it hit the dragon, the twitching became more rapid, the puddle of blood vomiting splatters of itself in every direction.

Then, various black wires began to march out from the dragon&#39;s skin. The dragon’s convulsions increased exponentially. When its massive tail smacked into the bus, black droplets rained through the cracked windows.

“Everyone get out of the bus!” The words careened out of Devin’s mouth, but it was useless, and not just because the door was on the roof.

The interior of the bus had become abuzz with the seizure-like movement of children as wires began sprouting from their bodies. Devin couldn’t do anything but stare in horror as one of the children ran up to him. His last thought before the kid vomited black liquid onto his face was of his cat.

He could feel the iron in his blood start to grow. His veins began to harden, then bulge and bend like rubber. They shot out of his body, reaching for nothing. His skin began to grow soft, then melt like wax, his ionizing interior greedily gulping down the air.

Some sort of emotion should have pushed through his brain, but all that was there was emptiness. He was being hollowed out, and there was no real reason to care. All his memories dissolved into darkness, leaving behind only steel.

His cat would be okay, however.

_________

//The mech was eventually destroyed due to various self defense mechanisms. However, various pieces of the mech split off from the hole and began to move on their own. A majority of these pieces were not found.//

//About 35,000 civilians were killed or transformed.//

______

Through what was once Chicago, hundreds of monsters marched in perfect synchronization, their many limbs dancing above the rubble in a steady beat. Above them, a dragon made of squirming black tendrils stamped a rumbling shadow onto the broken corpses of buildings.

_____

//At around this exact time, The Foundation became aware of an outbreak of 610, The Flesh That Hates. Apparently, an affected entity had managed to escape the quarantine zone, and had traveled to a small Siberian town.//

//A Level 1 Broken Veil Scenario was immediately put in place, as thousands of videos of dragon and mech mayhem had already choked the internet. A quarantine zone was placed around the city of Chicago.//

//By March 19th, 2019 over a thousand instances of 6217 had been reported across the midwest. Attempts to contain it, as well as the infected 682, proved difficult.//

//The Foundation entered communications with the UIU and the GOC.//

//An investigation on how 5514 had been infected proved fruitless.//

//On March 21st, 2019, 610 was successfully contained. However, the quarantine area had quadrupled, and it was predicted that about 40,000 people had been infected.//

//The Foundation and the US government attempted to terminate 682 through the use of a nuclear bomb dropped on Iowa. This attempt was, somehow, successful. It was unclear if 682 had died, or merely still lived within a few spare carbon atoms.//

//However, there were still various infected individuals roaming throughout the midwest.//

//On March 27th, 2019, a majority of captive octopi all over the world began acting violently, with many escaping captivity. Most of these died due to asphyxiation, but some managed to find a body of water.// 

//There were many instances of people entering a trance-like state, grabbing an octopi and then attaching it to their faces. The octopi would then proceed to control the person&#39;s movements, forcing them to jump into water. Approximately 18,000 people faced this fate.//

______

Monterey Bay Aquarium cast a quivering shadow over the pacific ocean. 

The wheels of the baby stroller sailed across the aquarium floor. “This is an octopus.” Irene Penn informed her 6-month old. She had been told that talking to her child was important, even if he didn’t understand what she was saying.

She had begun to push her son further, towards the jellyfish tank, when there was a crash. 

When she turned around, she was greeted with the sight of water spewing from a hole in an aquarium tank. Various octopi were worming through the hole and making a plopping sound as they landed on the floor. Purple blood from the glass cracks was beginning to mix with the water puddling around various pieces of glass and a large rock.

A loud cry erupted from her child, but Irene’s eyes were locked on one octopi. She reached down, grabbed it, then placed it on her face. The tentacles made a soft sucking noise as they attached to her skin.

Her baby continued to cry as she walked from the stroller, only to then stop. She turned around to face him. Through gaps between tentacles, she could see him, a defenseless little thing.

The hardness on the stroller was undone with a few snaps. With her baby perched in her arm, she grabbed an octopus from off the floor. She then placed the writhing creature on his head, then ran out of the aquarium and onto a ledge.

The blue water met her and her child with open arms.

_____

//Meanwhile, large amounts of octopi in the wild suddenly began to move to various locations, all of these instances of 4246-2.// 

//Footage of these places showed various persons being controlled by octopi. These persons were heavily modified, sporting tentacles and gills.//

//Various psychics working for the foundation picked up a message. The wording of this message varied from psychic to psychic, but it generally stated this: “Greetings. This is a message for humanity. The four beasts are awakening. The war will begin soon. We wish you no harm. We apologize for taking many of your kind. As a reward for their surface, they were given the gift of becoming like us. We have no intention of continuing to give this gift. Do not attack us. Do not message us.”//

//The 05 council ruled in a 7-5 vote to give in to these demands. 
Unfortunately, the GOC did not. Thousands of troops were deployed to kill all octopi still in captivity. However, all dispatched soldiers ended up falling under the spell and heading into the water. In total, about 2,000 soldiers were lost.//

____
Irene could vaguely remember a time when she had hands. 

Currently, she was using her tentacles to work on building some sort of machine. One of her eyes wandered to her reflection in an oily black stone stuck between coral. The reflection was of a massive, whale-like creature, with a multitude of tentacles coming from its head. A large quantity of octopi covered its wrinkled green skin. 

She could feel them, thinking for her. 

There was a longing in her mind for something, but what it was remained uncertain. “Soon he’ll be old enough to work. Then you will see him again.” The thought had come from the octopi, but it didn’t make any sense. Nevertheless, it seemed to do just the trick to inspire a sense of comfort inside her.

The coral machine she was building was much like the one in the first battle, a beast built for war. When the final battle came, its roar would join the glorious storm of battle.

______

//On March 28th, 2019, a Level 2 Broken Veil class scenario was announced. The Foundation revealed its presence to the world, but on and began to work with the UN and the GOC on Project Savior. Its mission was to figure out what was occurring and save the world.//

//On March 30th, 2019, a quarantine zone was placed in the US. Midwest, covering much of Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Iowa. At this point, about a dozen million people had been infected with 6217.//

//On April 3rd, 2019, various Bigfoot rampaged through the city of Portland, all screaming a single word, “Revenge!” Over 600 casualties occurred before the foundation eliminated all of the attackers.//

//Similar events would occur until abruptly stopping a few weeks later. The Foundation would later learn that the Bigfoot had all made a mass exodus to Alagada, as well as the elves dwelling in 4000. This information was gleaned from a captured Serpent’s Hand operative and the use of 645- The Mouth of Truth.//

//On April 11th, 2019, another breach of containment with 610 occurred. Again, a wayward entity had slipped through the cracks in the quarantine. This one made its way to the city of Kokshetau in Kazakhstan.//

//On April 22cnd, 2019, 1179, also known as The Centralian Fire Demon broke free from its containment underneath Centralia, Pennsylvania. It immediately headed for Allentown. All of the foundation’s attempts to kill it proved useless, until senior researcher Dr. Anthalt had the idea of air dropping various fire retardant chemicals onto it. Somehow, this worked, reducing the entity to nothing.//

//Unfortunately, where the demon went, fire followed, and a massive wildfire began to tear through Pennsylvania, spreading at anomalous speeds.//

//Despite the fact the wildfire appeared to be non-anomalous, there were multiple reports of people on fire still surviving.//
_______

Luma Barron knew what to do about fires, as she had come from a long line of park rangers. In fact, the inheriting of the ranger badge was her family&#39;s claim to fame. Everyday she would wake up and see the cut out Time Magazine article hanging on the wall: “Protectors of Sproul State Forest.” Of course, being a park ranger generally meant you just had to handle drunk people, give tours to kindergarteners, and hand out fines for littering.

None of that prepared her for when she suddenly smelled smoke, and then, three seconds later, she saw a massive laughing wall of flame scuttling towards her. This was strange. She had heard about the wildfires in Southern Pennsylvania, but this was miles away. However, she didn’t have time to think before the flames engulfed her. 

Two new strange events occurred. She was not dead. There was pain obviously, but she was still mobile. Her skin was peeling and her flesh was dripping, but she had the feeling that it didn’t matter. It would come back, just to be destroyed all over again.

The last strange thing was that she didn’t mind any of this. The pain was pleasurable because it was a sensation, and isn’t feeling something better than not feeling anything at all? It occurred to her she should feel as much pain as possible, and she had wasted her life avoiding it. However, there was a way to redeem herself. She just needed to spread the pain. This was a holy duty, far more important than giving people tickets for fishing without a license. Destruction was a gift that demanded to be shared.

So, with glee in her eyes, she ran with the flames.
_______

//On April 23rd, 2019, the breach of 610 was stopped. The quarantine zone was spread once again, with a large portion of Russia being overtaken, as well as parts of Kazakhstan, China, and Mongolia. About 28 million people had once lived in this zone.//

//On May 1st, 2019, the forest fire was finally stopped through the use of various weather altering SCPs such as 1948, 1149, and 853.//
_____
The groundwater carried the ashes into the river, and they mixed with each other till one couldn’t tell what had once been a human and what had once been a tree.
____

//On May 27th, 2019, 354, also known as The Red Pool, began to flood, washing away the site built around it and eventually overtaking the entire valley it was in. Thankfully, the pool was located in a sparsely lit area. About 200 foundation agents were killed, but only 400 civilian casualties occurred.//

//Meanwhile, large floods (of water) began to occur all over the world. The Foundation suspected the octopi were responsible, but all attempts to communicate were met with silence.//
_______

A bearded man knocked on a door.
“Come in.” 

The door opened to reveal Dr. Anthalt’s office, a hurricane of coffee cups and crumpled paper. The eye of the storm was Dr. Anthalt himself, a man with messy hair and tired eyes. His cigarette smoke drifted through the open window.

“Hey.” Dr. Kyrokon said, closing the door behind him.
“Hey.” Dr. Anthalt responded. 
“Yeah. How many have you had today?”
“The world’s ending, no one gives a shit.”
Dr. Kyrokon sighed. “You didn’t answer my question.”
“This is my first.” Dr. Anthalt lied.
“So, I guess four years off it means nothing to you?”
“As I said, the world is ending.” 
“And I guess, I don’t know, getting a promotion, all you ever talk about…that also means nothing to you?” Dr. Kyrokon said.
“I talk about other things.”

There was a pause as Dr. Anthalt did a brief spin of his swivel chair. He was always moving, much to Dr. Kyrokon’s annoyance.
Dr. Kyrokon cleared his throat. “What d-”
“How’s your son?” Dr. Anthalt asked, stopping his spinning.
“Good.”
“He still play guitar?” 
“Yeah. Look, why do you think this is all happening, all at once?”
Dr. Anthalt extinguished his cigarette with a sigh. “Do you want the scientist answer, the philosophical answer, or the four years of catholic boarding school answer?”
Dr. Kyrokon sighed. “I want to hear your answer.”
Dr. Anthalt shrugged. “Who knows. Even if there’s an answer, it’s probably beyond our clearance.”
There was another pause.
 Dr. Kyrokon eventually spoke.“Look, uhh, about my son, I’m writing my will.”
“That’s nice.”
“This is serious. Look…if I die…I want you to take care of him.”
“What? Are you crazy?” Dr. Anthalt snorted.
“You’re the only one I trust.

Dr. Anthalt ran his fingers over his stubble soaked chin. “I…really…me? Me? The only one?”
Dr. Kyrokon shrugged. “As you said, the world is ending.”

___________
//On June 27th, 2019 an instance of 993, Bobby the Clown, was broadcasted on all major TV stations in the United States. However, instead of telling children how to do violent things (his usual favorite activity), Bobby the Clown chanted “The battle is coming.” repeatedly until the foundation managed to stop the broadcast. Absolutely no fatalities were reported.  
The foundation ordered all television stations to stop broadcasting, but would repeal this four months later.//

//Also on this day, a break out occurred in Site 7 as various anomalies suddenly went through different modifications.//
_________

In a cell in Site-19, a woman lay. She was nine feet tall, with massive red veins running through her bone white skin, leading to pure red eyes. 

A little over a year ago, she looked like an average person. Unfortunately, she just so happened to be at a 7-11 when someone broke in and shot the owner. Despite all the evidence on her side, the jury still voted guilty. 

A few months after that, people in black armor shoved her in an unmarked white van. 

During her time spent in the prison of bizarreness, someone had injected what they said was an “antidote to Red Ice” into her arm, whatever that meant. That was probably about four months ago or so. 

Right now, she was staring up at the ceiling thinking up a modern day reimagining of Macbeth in her head. Instead of becoming king, Macbeth could be trying to become head of an Italian mob family. That would be interesting. Her creative writing teacher at the community college she went to said she had a “creative mind” but she suspected they were just being nice.

Suddenly, the silent air was punched to pieces by an explosion. She sat up and looked around her. Equally confused faces were perched in cells all around her. However, there was no evidence of structural damage everywhere. So, she leaned back down. It was probably some experiment gone wrong. 

Then, the entire universe screamed and a wave of dust flew into her face. When she came to, half of the wall was gone. Her cell door had fallen off its hinges, with nothing but a gaping hole left. 
Her tree-trunk legs thought for her.

When she entered the hall, she found various others also looking around them, freedom&#39;s siren song soaking their ears. Some did not have the same luck, their cell doors still up. However, they were not her problem.

Various people were starting to head for the main exit. “Wait!” she yelled. “There’s gonna be guards all over there.”
“So?”
“There’s gotta be a fire escape! The back of the buildings that way, it would make sense for it to be that way!” She pointed in the opposite direction.
“Whatever.” someone groaned, opening the door and immediately getting shot in the head. 

Those that could followed her in the opposite direction, eventually finding a door marked ‘Fire Escape’.
“Do you hear ticking?” someone with a face full of tattoos said.
“I hear a lot of things.” someone else replied.
“Holy shit!” someone else yelled. Coming from the door at the hall&#39;s other side was a pogo stick with a head on it, jumping towards them with lightning quick speed.

The group did not wait to open the door and storm through. She stayed put as they rushed in. The pogo creature was getting closer and closer. Then, the last person crossed the doorway. She followed suit. The pogo suit was about an inch away when she slammed the door.

They stormed down the fire escape, passing a door marked ‘4’, then one marked ‘3’, then one marked ‘2’, which was right next to a pile of rubble. “Great idea!” one person screamed at her.
Meanwhile, the sound of metal striking metal tumbled from above. When the group looked up, they saw the pogo stick bouncing down the steps.

Everyone rushed through the door marked ‘2’, slamming it right in front of the pogo stick. 
“I still hear that ticking.” the tattooed person said.
“Shut up!” she yelled. 
The hallway they were in appeared devoid of all life. They hurriedly stepped over various corpses lying on the ground as the sound of metal knocking came from behind them. Then, the wall exploded open. A large bird-like creature made out of clockwork flew through the hole, sinking its beak right into the forehead of the tattooed man.

Using its beak like a fork, the creature tore the man&#39;s head off, threw it into the air, and caught it in its beak. Meanwhile, behind the group, the door was bulging as something knocked into it. 

The woman with the red eyes reached forward, grabbed the creature by the beak, and smashed it against the wall. Then, she turned towards the door and tossed the creature, right as the door fell open. The creature slammed into the pogo stick.

“Run!” she screamed. Everyone followed her instructions.

 They made their way to a fork in their path. One person went right, only to stop when they saw a door right in front of them open. Unfortunately, they had too much momentum, leading to them tipping forward, landing right on a snail. The second they did, there was a sizzling sound and red steam floated in the air. 

The group headed left, only to find another fork. “Stairs!” someone said, pointing at a sign with an arrow leading to the right. They made their way to the stairs and then down the stairs, their feet creating a storm of stomps. 

The storm carried them down a hall and into a garage. It was there they stopped, shedding heavy, gasping breaths.

Surrounding them were various armored vehicles. Perfect.
“Does anyone here know how to break into a car?” she asked.

__________________

//The breakout at Site 7 led to 37 personal fatalities. About 37 different anomalies and 8 D-Class personnel break free from containment.//

//On August 28th, 2019, SCP 407, The Song of Genesis began playing on various AM and FM radio stations. Approximately 800,000 people were affected. The fact the song was supposed to be destroyed was inconsequential.//

//The Foundation immediately ordered all radio stations to cease all programming.//

//On September 2cnd, 2019, SCP 239, The Witch Child, was spotted in the middle of downtown London, despite having previously died. She was quickly brought into foundation custody, and when questioned, she claimed that she had been “sent back by The Dreaming Spirit” to take part in “the final battle”. She then proceeded to burst into a storm of laughter and then disappear in a puff of smoke.// 

//On September 8th, 2019, about 2,000 cases of 217,The Clockwork Virus, were reported in Zurich, Switzerland.//

//Other instances would be reported at a steady rate for the proceeding couple of months. The main headquarters of the UN were moved from Geneva to Paris.//

//On September 9th, 2019, SCP 200, The Cocoon, opened, with the boy emerging as a large insectoid creature. Security camera footage shows 239 appearing and saying something inaudible to him. They then both disappeared in a puff of smoke.//

//On September 14th, 2019 another instance of 993 was reported on all TVs worldwide. Bobby The Clown was conducting a full orchestra made up of unidentified humans. After a raise from Bobby’s baton, the sounds of the Song of Genesis blared from every instrument of the orchestra. About 14 million were affected before all broadcasts were stopped. The foundation immediately ordered all television networks to stop broadcasting.//

//The fatalities of this event included the head of the GOC.//

//On September 16th, 2019, 106, The Old Man disappeared from captivity and reappeared in New York Times square. He killed 20 civilians before being attacked by 239 riding on the back of 200.//
_____
The Old Man smashed into the pavement. The egg white sun was blocked by a head capped in a witches hat, zooming towards him. The head of The Witch stopped right next to his own. His body moved to attack, only for his right ear to be pummeled by a delicate whisper. “Somnium est super. Your sleeping mind has been seen by the Dreaming Hand, Robert Scranton. May it now be reawakened.”

The city faded away as the abyss returned.
______

//On September 18th, 2019 the octopi sent another message to the foundation. This was the first time the foundation head heard from them after months of sending them messages.
The wording of this message from the octopi also varied, but it generally said: “All shall come to an end. Our fall will be a glorious one. We do not have the cowardice of our ancestors. We do not need your help, jailers. Your kind are not with The Dreaming.”// 
______
“Guess who’s going to Siberia?” Dr. Anthalt said as he plopped himself down at a table.
“You?” Dr. Kyrokon looked up from his salad.
“No. Someone completely unrelated to the both of us. Of course it’s me. This guy got himself a promotion. And it’s all thanks to our good buddy the fire demon.”
“The fire demon that killed thousands of people.”
“Yeah…yeah…of course,” Dr. Anthalts smile immediately faded. “It’s very sad. You know what I meant. Aren’t you excited?”
“Yeah, I’m very excited. Good for you.”
“Thank you,” Dr. Anthalt beamed. “I volunteered myself…and you wouldn’t guess who I volunteered to…I mean, spoke to when I volunteered, whatever. You won’t guess who.”
“The Pope?
“No, O fucking 5 fucking 9.”
Dr. Kyrokon blinked in surprise. “Wow…that’s…that’s crazy.”
 “Yep.” Dr. Anthalt jumped up. “Well, I got more work to do.”
“You’re not gonna eat lunch?” Dr. Kyrokon asked.
“I don’t need lunch,” Dr. Anthalt said. “I’m too important.”
“Yes you do. And no you are not.” Dr. Kyrokon said as Dr. Anthalt walked away.

______

//On September 19th, 2019
Approximately 2,000 instances of creatures similar to 1003, The Tapeworm Child, were reported in central Africa (mainly The Central African Republic, South Sudan, Chad, and Cameroon). Similarly to 1003, these creatures were tapeworms that lay eggs in a human’s gastrointestinal tract, and these eggs turned into human embryos which turned into sharp toothed babies which ate their way out of their host. Differing from 1003, these creatures developed much quicker, going from eggs to infancy in about 2 hours. Not only that, but the infants had an abrupt growth rate, becoming adults in less than a day. They were also unusually tall, with an extra set of arms and glowing red eyes.

Many of them were taken into foundation containment, but not all. Those that did appeared to have full intelligence. It should be noted that they called the foundation “jailers” and “disgusting”, and also mentioned Biphi, the Daevite goddess of sacrifice.

Instances would be reported around central Africa at a steady rate for the next couple of months.

The beginning of a major environmental catastrophe would begin on this day. 1001, Ya Te Veo, began overtaking the Amazon Rainforest, as well as 1013, Cockatrice.
Their rapid expansion would continue in the upcoming months. Other heavily vegetated areas found themselves covered in 697, Toxic Terraforming.

On September 20th, 2019
Multiple anomalies disappeared from foundation containment. These included 048, The Plague Doctor, as well as 847, the Mannequin.

Also on that day, a green cloud randomly appeared above a spot in Tennessee and began to rain 1100, Gaia’s Blood. By the time the foundation was notified of this, the cloud was gone. It was theorized that the cloud was made up of Gaia’s Blood in a gaseous state. Once the gas had all been turned into liquid, there was no more cloud. About 6,000 people were transformed.

On September 22cnd, 2019
 Able went missing. He had been dispatched to deal with 610, as he was immune. However, the tracker put into him suddenly went dark, and foundation officials couldn’t find him.

On September 24th, 2019
A massive cloud of cobwebs, believed to be 1506, appeared above Washington state. Approximately 30,000 people were pulled in and presumably eaten alive by spiders. Many of those not pulled in reported feeling headaches and the need to “experience sulfur and the stench of rotting eggs”.

On September 25th, 2019
The plague doctor was found dead in a hospital in France. Footage showed him working on various patients when the witch and Able teleported into the room. Able proceeded to kill him as well as the patients he had infected. The witch then grabbed his arm, and they both disappeared.

A quarantine zone for 217 was placed around the entirety of Switzerland, as well as various parts of Germany, Italy, and Austria.

It was also on this day that the UN gave the foundation emergency power over all countries with dead leadership such as Russia, Canada, Italy, and the United States. The foundation was also given the power to violate all human rights laws and decrees.//

“It’s tyranny, tyranny!” Dr. Kyrokon bellowed.
“Yeah…yeah sure whatever.” Dr. Anthalt said.

From Dr. Anthalt’s view, Dr. Kyrokon was just a bearded head on a computer screen, with the impeccable cleanliness of his house behind him. There was also the sound of guitar playing in the background, which Dr. Anthalt thought might have been Freebird.

“I can’t believe this,” Dr. Kyroken roared. “Whatever happened to mister rebel? Mister I’ll smoke if I want to?”
“The only person smoking endangers is me. Listen, we’ve got a heart the size of a blue whale in Mexico City, a massive mechanical boar in Canada, and uhh…uhhh…you know, other stuff.” Dr. Anthalt could not think of a third thing.
“What does that have to do with giving us the ability to commit human rights violations?”
“Look, man, I don’t want to argue with you.” Dr. Anthalt fiddled with a rubber band, his way of saying that he wished to stop conversing.

“I’m just asking you a question.” Dr. Kyrokon lowered his voice. Dr. Anthalt had seen him use that same technique with his son. 
“You know! Free speech gets in the way of stopping memetic hazards, policies against killing civilians get in the way of stopping diseases. All that stuff.” Once again, Dr. Anthalt wished he could have thought of a third thing. A rhetoric class he took in college had taught him the importance of the rule of threes. However, he never seemed to be able to get past two.
“You’re being selfish.”
“How am I being selfish?” Dr. Anthalt asked.
“Because getting ahead is more important to you than what’s right!”
“Or maybe, maybe, if you’ll consider this, maybe someone disagrees with you. I know, I know, it’s impossible to conceive.”

Dr. Kyrokon sighed. “We’re not gods, Mickey.” The use of a nickname was another common tactic of Dr. Kyrokon. It was taking all of Dr. Anthalt’s strength not to scream “I’m not a child!”, as that would have proved his guilt.
“The 05 council might be. I’m not sure about that one. By the way, is that Freebird?” 
Dr.Kyrokon sighed. “Yeah. How is Siberia?” 
“Cold. And buggy. Like everything about Poland, but worse. He’s good. I once tried to learn guitar but uhhh…”

There was a pause. Dr. Anthalt moved from fiddling with a rubber band to fiddling with a cigarette.
“The world isn’t ending,” Dr. Kyrokon murmured. “It’s going to be alright, right? Everything’s going to calm down. I’m sure once everything is over they’ll stop with the whole fascist thing. Right?”
“Of course.” Dr. Anthalt lied.

Dr. Anthalt realized he should have mentioned the instances of 1461-1, but it was too late now.
_____

//On September 26th, 2019, 1483, The Third Antarctic Empire, opened and various Homo Antarcticus came out. Multiple casualties were reported before foundation troops drove them back.

At this same time, a case of 6217 was reported in Kansas, and 610 escaped containment once again.

On that night, all communications with the city of Las Vegas abruptly stopped. An MTF squad was sent.//
_________________
“Yes?” Dr. Kyrokon picked up the phone.
“Do you want to lead an MTF mission, from here, obviously?” The voice on the other side was the head researcher of Site 21.
“Oh, wow, thank you. I’ve never done that before. Uh…when?”
“Now.”
_________

It was clear that something was wrong even before the helicopter had landed. The kaleidoscope of lights which had defined Las Vegas were absent. When the helicopter landed, things grew even stranger.

Squad 47A crept through the strip, the only light reflecting on their full body armor being that of the full moon.

Surrounding them were what might have once been people. Their pitch white faces bobbled down the street. At the center of these faces were two black holes where their eyes had once been. Bumping against their sides were arms that ended in solid white stumps instead of hands. Their wandering was aimless and devoid of all intent.

To complete this strange sight was the amber-like liquid goo on the street. The squad members had been told to stay clear of it.

A voice came through their coms. It was Dr. Kyrokon, who was using their camera feeds to watch them from Carson City. “It’s hard to make out, the people, are they women?”
“Why is that important?” squad commander Ayja Gonzalez responded.
“Just tell me, are they women?”
“Hard to tell. They all have long hair.” she said.
“Interesting. How does everything smell?”
“How does everything smell?” squad commander Ayja Gonzalez responded.
“Yes, how is it smelling?”
“We’re wearing helmets.” Ayja had to put in effort from ending the sentence with the word “dummy”  or one of its many synonyms.
“Shoot.” Dr. Kyrokon never swore.
“Why did you want to know?” The word “dummy” once again had to be caged inside Ayja’s mouth.
“Oh…uhhh…hold on a second. I’m gonna give you directions to a warehouse. Okay, are you listening?”

It was easy to spot their destination, as it was absolutely covered in the amber-like goo. Surrounding it were a crowd of people that ignored the squad as they shoved past them.
“They probably can’t tell what gender you are. That’s good.”
“What does that mean?” Ayja asked.
Ayja could hear Kyrokon sigh through the com. His mouth was too close to the mic, but she didn’t want to say anything. “Okay, it’s gonna take a while to explain, but there was a mannequin that we had in containment. It has a habit of turning what it sees as women into other mannequins and what it sees as men into uhhh…corpses. It kills them, I mean. However, all of this is…well, it’s new.”
“Where are the men?” It was another member of the squad, who was not supposed to talk. 
“Barbara, I’m the only one who’s supposed to talk.” Ayja said.
“That rule doesn’t make any sense,” Barbara responded. “W-”
“Excuse me-” Dr. Kyrokon cleared his throat. “It doesn’t matter. I don’t know where the men are, or what the mannequin thinks is a man, however one thing I do know is that the mannequin was found in a warehouse that you are currently staring at. So, I need you to get a stick and touch the liquid.”

There was the faint sound of Barbara whispering a soft sorry, and the faint sound of Ayja saying it was okay followed by a sigh.

A stick was quickly fetched and applied to the goo. Nothing occurred. “Okay,” Dr. Kyrokon said. “It seems alright.” Usually, the foundation would be using scanners or some other fantastical technology. However, their resources were rather stretched.

The first person to enter the squad was Ayja, who immediately stopped. “Uhhh…I think there’s something in here.”
She did not wait for permission before yanking that something out of the goo, revealing it as a pair of jeans with a belt around it.
“Holy shit,” it was Barbara. “Oh sorry. I’m not s-”
“It’s fine, Barb.” Ajya sighed.
Multiple other pieces of clothing were found in the goo, until Dr. Kyrokon spoke. “We don’t have time for this. Just go through the goo until you hit a wall and then uhhh…”
“How about we use explosives instead?”
“Oh…yeah…that’s a much better idea. We should have done that to begin with. Frick.”

Less than half a minute later, and the C4 had been planted. The various mannequin people were shoved out of the blast radius.

There was a great bang, and globs of goo were raining down on the MTF squad’s black helmets. Once the swarm of dust cleared, a wall with a massive hole in it was revealed. However, no one was looking at what was inside the hole, because it was then when the various mannequin people around the building had all gone haywire. 

The MTF found themselves being pushed to the ground. “Don’t shoot!” Ayja shouted.

Unfortunately, people are stupid, and someone had already pressed a trigger.

There was the sound of a bullet ricocheting off of the mannequin people, followed by a loud scream. The bullet had found its home in the lower jaw of Ayja, piercing through the place between the helmet. 

Her coms were still working, allowing everyone’s ears to be blasted with a cacophony of awful sounds. Ayja ripped off her helmet, and the second her long hair was revealed, it was over for her.

The mannequins immediately began to descend on her. More shots were fired from the various other MTF members, but more ricocheting was all that occurred. None of the members were hit. Barbara jumped straight into the pile surrounding Ayja. 

What happened next was a blur of white and black. This blur ended with the mob of mannequins dispersed, forming a circle around two figures. One was what was once Ayja. Now, her skin had turned a plaster white, and the space where her eyeballs had been was a black void. There were white stumps where hands once were. She was standing above Barbara, lying on the ground, with her helmet broken. 

“Shit. Shit. Okay,” It was Dr. Kyrokon. “You all need to uhhh…”
Barbara raised her head, and half of her helmet fell off, revealing a face topped by short hair. The various mannequins stared at her. There was a moment of silence. Another member ran up to her. “Are you o-”
He was cut off by a great deal of screaming from the mannequins. This blasting of sound sent all members of the squad onto the ground. There was a screeching as the comms went off.

However, that was not the worst of it. Amber goo began to leak from Barbara’s mouth. The sound of choking eclipsed the speaking of a single word, “Ayja-”

Barbara fell back onto the ground as her skin began to take on the shape of liquid. In less then a few seconds, there was nothing left but a pile of goo and some body armor.

There was a moment of calm. The various mannequin people resumed their aimless wandering.

The rest of the MTF squad did not know what to do. There were six left. One of them had a cracked faceplate leaking red, but they wisely chose to keep it on.
Then, one of them noticed what was on the other side of the hole.

It was a mannequin, or more specifically The Mannequin.

Every member held their fire.

It was at that moment when they were able to witness a puff of smoke and various figures appearing behind the mannequin. When The Mannequin turned around, it found a sword going through its head. This did not seem to phase The Mannequin who simply ripped off its own head and punched its attacker, a large tattooed man. 

Next to him was an insect-like creature and a girl wearing a witches outfit. Immediately, the mannequin people all began moving towards their leader. 

The MTF members might have survived if it wasn’t for the fact that every mannequin in the city was stampeding towards the hole in the wall.

They were not able to see the fight full of flying pieces of plastic. By the time the witch let loose a massive fireball, their armor had already broken from the trampling of thousands of plastic feet, and their body was reduced to a red puddle.

When the dust settled, there was a strange sight. The Witch, the long haired man, and the insect creature were all inside a massive bubble of orange light. Outside the bubble, miles of rubble and immobile mannequins stretched forth.

//On September 27th, 2019, various nuclear weapons were used to beat back the spread of 610.// 

//Instances of creatures similar to Major Alexei Belitrov were reported in the locations of bombardment. These soldiers did not appear to be soviets, but instead bore flags with an unknown symbol on them. They began firing on SCP troops.// 

//At this same time, Major Alexei Belitrov appeared in the middle of Site 19. An interview of him by the foundation revealed that the insects coming in were from his dimension, and he had been brought back to life by “The hand of dreams.” He gave them various tactical information, then refused to say anything more.//

//It should also be noted the nuclear weapons did next to nothing to beat back the spread of 610.// 

__________
Dr. Kyrokon slammed the front door shut.
“Hey.” Niles Kyrokon, his son, said.

Dr. Kyrokon’s only response was a soft murmur as he marched past Niles towards his bedroom.

From the outside, Niles could hear his father crying. 

____

A few minutes later.

“Hey, I’m Mikojay Anthalt. If you have this number, then you know too much. Leave a message at the beep.” the phone said.
Dr. Kyrokon lay against the bed.
“Hey, I...I was leading a…I was…I was commanding a…last night…I…oh god…I was leading a mission remotely, and they…well they all died, because I froze. Because I didn’t know what to do. Please call me. Please. I need to talk to someone. I told you you were the only one I trusted. Please.”

The call was ended and the phone tossed aside. The casual act of just throwing an important object was something that Kyrokon would normally never do. That sort of thing was Mickey’s usual forte. 

Then, there was a knock at the door.“Dad, are you okay?”
“I’m fine.” Dr. Kyrokon responded.
“It sounded like…uhhh..it sounded like…” Niles trailed off.
“I’m fine. You should probably go to bed.”
“It’s 9 AM, Dad.” 
There was a pause.
“Is it the spooky stuff?”
“Yeah… it’s the spooky stuff.”

There was another pause. “You know when I was 9, and I thought you worked for the government I told all the other kids that you worked for the F.B.I. I would make up stories about you shooting bad guys and stuff like that. It’s kind of funny, how like, the real shit- I mean the real stuff…it’s far more crazy than that.”
“Yeah.”
There was a pause.

“I love you.” Dr. Kyrokon said.
“I love you too.”

Dr. Kyrokon wiped his eyes before he got up and opened the door. “How’s Freebird coming along?”
“It’s hard.”
“Well, I’m sure that will just make it better when you…succeed…”
Niles did not roll his eyes, despite the fact that he obviously wanted to. 
There was another pause. “The world’s not gonna end, is it?”
Dr. Kyrokon leaned down and grabbed his son’s shoulder. “No. No it is not. Because I will not let it. You are going to wake up one morning, and the news will just be the ordinary kind of depressing, and no one will be talking about monsters, and everything will be normal again.”

 It was a lie.
__________

//On September 29th, 2019, a video was uploaded to every social media platform and proceeded to get 34 million views. It showed Bobby the Clown leading the same orchestra as before in playing the song of genesis. All 60 million who saw it were infected.//

//The foundation immediately shut down all social media sites. It was this event that made Project Savior labeled a failure. The death of many world leaders in the previous couple days lead to the UN granting the Foundation emergency powers for an indefinite amount of time.//

//It was this that led to the creation of the A.F.F (the anti-federation front). This was an anarchist group with many former members of the Chaos Initiative, GOC, and even some former members of “Are We Cool Yet?”.//
_____
The subway floor shuttered beneath Dr. Kyrokon’s feet. Next to him, someone was listening to a video without headphones. Annoying.
Suddenly, he felt an itch in his neck.
Then, another itch appeared, this one on his back.

The phone of the annoying person had fallen to the ground, but the music was still playing. He was itching too, and so was everyone else on the train.

Then, the metal box was filled with the sound of flesh ripping and stretching.

Dr. Kyrokon’s last thought was of his son.
_________
As the helicopter flew above what was once the Russia-Kazakhstan border, Dr. Anthalt tried to think of something witty to say.
He had specifically volunteered to go here, to this cold and dangerous place, and he needed everything to not just go right, but for everybody to be absolutely pleased with their interactions with him.
His thinking was interrupted by the crackling of his earpiece. “Hey,” It was the MTF leader back at the base. “Have you planted the drone?”
“Yeah, we’re flying back now.”
“Something’s happened.”
____

//On September 31st, 2019, there should not have been a September 31st, 2019. However, every calendar suddenly had a September 31, and every machine that displays dates said it was September 31st.//

//It was on this day that 50% of the anomalies contained in Site 19 disappeared. These included Major Alexei Belitrov, as well as Lord Blackwood.//

//Meanwhile, the air above Johannesburg was filled with millions of human nervous systems. No living human beings remained.// 
_______
Dr. Anthalt played the message over and over again. The last thing he had said to Dr. Kyrokon had been a lie. 
________
The bus coughed along the road. Various other employees and their families sat on the bus. “Are we gonna have a funeral?” Those were the first words that Niles had spoken to Dr. Anthalt since it happened. 
“I…I don’t know. Do you...do you…”
“No. Not really.”
There was another pause. The two of them simply sat and sweated. There was no air conditioning on the bus. Why was there no air conditioning? They were the most powerful organization in the world. 

“You don’t have to, you know…I don’t need…I don’t need to be taken care of…”
There was a pause. What Dr. Anthalt wanted to say was “Yes you do, idiot.” However, he simply nodded his head.

____
A couple hours later, and the two of them were in an apartment in San Salvador. You could tell that it had once belonged to a family, despite the foundation’s efforts. There were plastic stars on the ceiling of one room, but they had been painted over. Why were they painted over? The foundation couldn’t put air conditioning in a bus, but they had the time to completely renovate a room?
Niles was unpacking, and Dr. Anthalt was staring at the ceiling, thinking about plastic stars. “Is there something you uhhh…want to say?” Niles asked.
“Uhhh…well, I guess not.” Getting the hint, Dr. Anthalt left the room to go unpack.

His room had formerly been the room of the parents of the family. He could tell that because there was a night stand on each side of the bed. One had a water stain on it. As Dr. Anthalt unpacked his suitcase and delicately placed his clothes on the bed, he pictured a scene in the life of the couple
“Use a coaster.” one would say.
“Mmmhmmm.” the other would say, not listening. This one probably liked drinking a glass of water before he went to sleep.
The other one would sigh, having given up. 

Dr. Anthalt was pushed out of his fantasy by the words of Niles, appearing in the door frame.
“My Dad always says you’re messy.” 
“What?” He turned around to see Niles, standing at the door frame.
“I…I mean…you’re uhhh…I don’t know, he just…that’s very neat.”
Dr. Anthalt studied his clothes, all folded nicely on the bed. His former headmistress at this childhood school would have been proud of him. “We’ll make a proper catholic woman of you just yet, Agata.” She would have said.
“Well…I…uhhh…Well,” Dr. Anthalt stuttered in the non hypothetical present. “I guess…we all got to change sometimes…you know…life and stuff.”
Niles snorted.
“So,” Dr. Anthalt muttered. “He talked about me?”
“Yeah, he talks about you, all the time.”
“Talked.” The word flung out of Dr. Anthalt without him thinking about it.
“Yeah, he talked about you. He says, I mean he said, your office was like a…a… a landfill…and…”
Niles began to cry.
“Hey…hey…” Dr. Anthalt said, rising.
Niles continued to cry. “Uhhh…hey…uhhh…it’s uhhh…sad, but you don’t have to…no…you should it’s…I…how…how about I get you some water?”
Niles broke out into laughter. “Water? Water? Why would you offer that?”
“I…I don’t know. Crying…dehydrates you.” 
Niles wiped away his tears. “He also said you’re an idiot.”
“You can say ‘says’ if you want to.”

A few minutes later, Niles was staring at the bottom of a glass of water. They were in the main room of the apartment. On the wall hung two pairs of gas masks.
“So…the thing with the will…did you like, officially adopt me or whatever?”
“I don’t know…actually…but…the world is en-I meant the world is…” Dr. Anthalt trailed off.
“It’s ending.”
Dr. Anthalt fiddled with his hands. “Well, every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.”
“Closing Time.” Niles said.
“Yeah. You know about that song?”
“Of course I do. I’ve listened to the album it’s on. It’s really good. They’re kind of a one hit wonder but uhhh…their other stuff is good too...”
“Oh…well…I’ll have to check it out.”
There was silence. Eventually, Dr. Anthalt spoke.
“Do you not want me to…I don’t know…I can like…there’s an orphanage as part of the camp. If you don’t…”
“Do you want me to be here?” Niles blurted.
“Your Dad wanted me to take care of you.”
“But what do you want? Please, I need…”
Dr. Anthalt nervously fiddled with his fingers.
“You seem…chill. And, well…if we want humanity to survive then…we need to take care of each other. But if you don’t…”
“I want to stay. With you. I think if I don’t I’ll go crazy.”
______

//On October 1st, 2019
There was another containment breach, as all of the 1003 entities in containment staged a successful breakout. Not only that, but at that exact time, 1483 opened again, with many more Homo Antarcticus coming out. They were driven back by SCP personnel, as well as The Witch, who placed a giant magic wall in front of it. She then loudly yelled “Screw you!” And disappeared in a puff of smoke. It was unclear if she was shouting it at the SCP personnel, or the Homo Antarcticus.//

//The place where she went is known, since at that same time, 1770, the Maker of Chains, was wreaking havoc in Paris. 035, The Possessive Mask, adorned its metal head, despite that being seemingly impossible due to what we know about the two entities. 
One thing we do know is that Able, Major Alexei Belitrov, The Witch, the creature from 200, and Lord Blackwood (who was somehow dozens of feet tall) appeared and collectively destroyed 1770 and ripped The Mask off its head. This also should have been impossible. The Witch then reportedly said something along the lines of, “Black lord, you have committed treason.” and then turned 035 into a pile of sludge, which she then absorbed.
It should also be noted that The Witch was the only one who actually fought 1770 and 035. It was hypothesized that the others were just there for show. 
Furthermore, it should be noted that Lord Blackwood was wearing a large hat.//

//Also on this day, the entirety of North Korea was lost. Observations showed it having been entirely consumed by a blob believed to be 031.//

//Lastly, this was the day in which the foundation ordered the termination of all anomalies currently in containment, including the safe ones. No exceptions were to be made. Approximately 5% of anomalies in containment were eventually deemed impossible to kill after various attempts failed. These anomalies included 053, 999, and 173.//

____
“Well, before I allowed it, I wanted to talk with you, about reconsidering this.” Dr. Anthalt said on the phone, making sure to be quiet.
“You’ve already terminated 15 of the anomalies in your section.” The voice of the woman on the other was calm.
“Yes, but…those were all objects. This…this is…a child.”
“A murderous child with black eyes.” The voice was starting to grow angry.
“Yes…but…isn’t this wrong? Isn’t it…illegal?”
The other side of the phone was silent.
“Well, I mean, obviously, that’s not relevant…but it goes against…well I guess there’s no one to tell us we can’t do it but, we…we…”
“Listen, Dr. Anthalt, that anomaly will die. It doesn’t matter what you do about it. The foundation wants strong people, people willing to make sacrifices. Whether or not you succeed is a matter of choice.”
Dr. Anthalt breathed in. It was like she had read his mind at some point. “Okay…I…after this…I want to be transferred out of containment.”
“You specifically asked to be transferred to containment because you didn’t want to do field missions.” The voice was sharp, every word puncturing like a white hot needle.
“Okay, well…I changed my mind!”
The voice sighed. “You must have been a truly unpleasant child, Mr. Anthalt.”

//On October 2cnd, 2019
The AFF attacked a foundation encampment in Turkey, but were successfully beaten back.//

//On October 4th, 2019
Every screen in the world suddenly showed a message of Bobby the Clown and the symphony. They began to play The Song of Genesis, but were stopped when Lord Blackwood, now three times as tall and with the others on his back, crashed through a wallback. He screamed “You’re not getting away with this one, you stupid bloody clown!” 
The rest of the group  proceeded to murder the clown and the orchestra. Halfway through the carnage, the broadcast ended abruptly.//

//It was during this broadcast that the Yellowstone supervolcano exploded.// 

//The soldiers from the other dimension had gotten ahold of The Dead Hand and used it to launch a nuke at Yellowstone National Park. The nuke should not have caused the volcano to explode. That did not change the result.//

//It was at this point that The Foundation began the preparation of various ships containing the human genome to be sent into space. Their destination was to be the exoplanet of Kepler 22-B//

//October 5th, 2019
2028, The Nightmare Snowglobe, exploded and sent a variety of nightmares all over Site 23. One of these was seen by 2006, who proceeded to turn into a massive eldritch monstrosity. It went on a rampage through most of Canada before being stopped by The Witch, who launched it into the red lake.//

_____
Unfortunately, Dr. Anthalt was back in Russia. Even worse, it had grown cold.
“Have you been…uhhh…eating well?” He spoke into the phone.
“I had a blueberry muffin for breakfast.” Niles responded.
“Okay…I think that’s good. Was it organic?”
“Probably.”

An MTF was striding up to him.
“Great! Well, I have to go. Remember to uh, brush your teeth and all that stuff. And floss, I guess!”

____
A few minutes later.

This time, he was not in the helicopter, but was instead viewing it through the MTF’s camera feeds.

Inside the helicopter were three MTF members, one thaumaturgist, and two live goats.

Down below, a group of soviet soldiers rode on the backs of strange creatures.
“Are those…” he asked.
“939 beings? Yep. No clue how they got them.” One of the members in the helicopter said.

“And are you sure they can’t see you?”
“If they were, then they would have fired on us.”
The helicopter had been soaked with liquid nitrogen, and as such, was merely a blip on the soldier’s heat vision goggles.

As the camera traveled on, they passed by various buildings and encampments. 
“Okay,” the thaumaturgist said. “When this portal is destroyed, then so will the magical force field. And when that happens…” the thaumaturgist began to laugh maniacally. Dr. Anthalt was not sure if this was how thaumaturgists usually acted, or if it was just this one.

The soldier’s territory was a patch of brown earth amidst many mountains of red flesh. At the edge of the territory, various soldier thaumaturgists worked, beating back the flesh with white light.

At the center was a massive glowing white sphere. 

It wasn’t very dramatic. The goats were sacrificed, the thaumaturgist did a spell, and the helicopter flew away as the white lights faded. Dr. Anthalt just stared at the video feed as the sea of red consumed the entirety of the territory.

He could make out specks of green running around, before being consumed. Some tried to enter helicopters, but the wave of flesh was too quick. One by one, every single bite of green was devoured. Sacrifices for his promotion.

The glowing white sphere blinked out of existence.

_____

//It was around this same time that The Foundation managed to find the source of the Soviet soldiers, a portal in Russia. The destruction of the portal and a forcefield lead to the remaining soldiers being consumed by 610.

Meanwhile, the exploding of Yellowstone lead to casualties in the dozens of millions.

In addition to all of this, 6217, 610, and 217 all continued to spread. In total, they had claimed over 800 million victims. 

The foundation used Protocol Sharp to dissolve all world governments, placing themselves as the only rulers of earth. This power was used to order the destruction of all devices with speakers (obviously, excluding various sanctioned devices that the foundation used). This was because, despite the apparent death of Bobby The Clown, the Song of Genesis would still occasionally play from random speakers. Thankfully, the thaumaturgical spells placed on scp devices seemed to keep it back.

Meanwhile, the amount of flooding had quadrupled.//
______

“I don’t think this is right.”
“You mean, I don’t think this is right, ma’am.”
05-9 stared at Doctor Anthalt through her thick, horn rimmed glasses. She reminded him profusely of the head mistress at his school back in Poland.
Dr. Anthalt sighed “I don’t think this is right, ma’am.”
“That’s very nice. Do you have anything else to say?”
There was a pause. 
“Well, I suppose I do,” Dr. Anthalt said. “I…I helped you…kill about 2,000 people, including…well. I have…turned a blind eye to…”
05-9 sighed. “Mr. Anthalt, if you have a problem with ethics, then we have a c-”
“Dr. Anthalt.”
“Don’t interrupt me.”
“Sorry.”
“Sorry ma’am.”
Dr. Anthalt sighed. “Sorry, ma’am.”
“Listen…after Russia, I vouched for your promotion. Others didn’t. 05-7 is a particularly old fashioned man, and he was not happy with your gender identity, shall we say…needless to say, you are currently one of our top researchers. You made the right decision in Russia and with the girl. You were rewarded for both. If you keep on making the right decisions, then you will continue to be rewarded. And…a spot on the 05 council may be opening up.”

Meanwhile, various instances of 2256 began appearing on various islands in Polynesia, despite all of them having died. These instances appeared to be hostile, leading casualties in the hundreds.//

//It was at this point when anomalous devices were beginning to be used on foundation agents so they didn’t need to sleep.//

//The A.F.F. attacked a federation encampment in Argentina and successfully captured it, killing all federation officials inside. Not wanting them to have the various anomalies contained inside, the foundation’s response was to bomb the encampment, killing the 120 A.F.F troops and the 300 civilians inside.//

//October 8th, 2019
SCP 2300,The Periodic Golems appeared in Sweden, attacking a seemingly random building in Oslo. It was later learned that this building was the location of [redacted], a former Sarkite. He was killed when the golems, who were ten times as tall as they were before, attacked him.//
_______
Dr. Anthalt had not gotten any sleep in a week. 

Currently, he was paying attention to two things. One of those was a TV screen which showed a group of MTF soldiers destroying a group of golems with flamethrowers. Another was a wrinkled paper with a to-do list scribbled on it.
“Ask Niles if he ate. Deal with that fucking painting of an owl. Meet with Anderson Robotics representative.  Wash the dishes.”
Also on the note was a number: 2,430. It was the number of deaths he had caused.

His mind fiddles with the idea of asking to be transferred back to containment. Niles was probably getting lonely with him gone so much.

//October 9th, 2019
2343, the Egyptian god of creation known as Ptah, escaped from his containment. He proceeded to then head northwards to the middle east “to save humanity from themselves ”. He was stopped after a massive battle with 343, Methuselah, ended up destroying both entities. This battle ended up taking the lives of roughly 20,000 civilians.//

//..|…..|..|. was discovered hovering above various instances of 4246-2. Its motives were unknown. Obviously, the octopi still refused to communicate, and all attempts to spy on them had failed. It was believed that they were still kidnapping people and mutating them, and many hypothesized that was the reason why the floods were happening.// 

//A town full of instances of 2785-1 were discovered in Mexico. All were terminated.//

**Meanwhile, the entirety of Site-29 was converted into marble due to 2860, Made of Stone. This monolith of marble continued to grow, consuming both organic and inorganic material, only stopped by any matter that was liquid.**
 //The entire area was bombed, which stopped the spread. Amid the bombed region, the corpse of Dr. Harold Thompson, aka 2860, was found in a puddle of an unidentified liquid, seemingly not affected by the blast. The corpse still demonstrated the same anomalous effect, but was taken into containment for possible use as a weapon.//
_____
“Cool huh?” Dr. Anthalt pointed to the various lego dinosaurs behind the glass wall. 
“Yeah…I guess…should I be here?” Niles looked around as he spoke, as if afraid that the walls would shout at him.
“Oh come on, where’s your…rebellious spirit.”
“I…well…it is very impressive. I am 14 by the way.” 
“Oh…okay…well…do you wanna see them being destroyed by flamethrowers or…”
Niles&#39; eyes grew wide. “Oh…I…sure. I…I…sure.”


Dr. Anthalt smiled slightly as he brought a walkie talkie to his mouth. “Light ‘em up boys.”

//October 12th, 2019- October 14th, 2019
2845, THE DEER, broke containment, and immediately went on an unstoppable war path, converting about 24 million people in the span of three days. The deer eventually made its way to the red lake, at which point it jumped in. After that, the foundation had no clue what happened to it.//

_________________________
They had just cooked the baby. The only problem was, it hadn’t been a baby all along. None of them realized this fact until they each bit down on a slab of rock. As to how they did not notice the baby had been replaced by a rock was unclear, as well as to how they had cut a rock into pieces. It was also unclear how the rock was replaced.

However, none of that mattered. A few seconds after their teeth cracked and blood began to pour down their forehead, there was the sudden sound of music from nowhere, and every-single one of the ritual performers found themselves turning into rubbery green pillars. At that exact moment, The Deer sprung into movement, crashing through a wall and running down the hall. 

The other members inside the site did not have any time to activate the nuke before they were all turned into pillars as well. Thankfully, alarms had immediately been activated anyway, and the nuke had been armed. Unfortunately, half of the nuke melted the second The Deer broke through the wall.

ALL YOUR RITUALS ARE NOW MEANINGLESS. THE MEMORY OF BELIEF IS FAILING.
__________


//Another outbreak of 610 occurred, leading to the entirety of Russia and the Central Asian region being quarantined.//

//An outbreak of 1121, The Skinning Disease occurred in Cyprus. The Foundation immediately quarantined the place, and then airdropped parts of the body of 2860 onto the island. These pieces took over the entirety of the island, only stopping when reaching the ocean. This successfully stopped the spread of the disease.//
_______

Dr. Anthalt looked into the water ring on the wooden table as he spoke into a phone. “Sorry, uh…ma’am… I sent a message, but it all happened so quickly. I…”
He could hear 05-9 chuckling on the other side of the phone.
“I see you took what I said about right decisions to heart. The other 05s are pleased with your action. We’ll make a proper head researcher out of you yet.”
“I…I…” Dr. Anthalt didn’t know how to respond to that. Was an 05 actually giving him a compliment?
05-9 continued. “If y-w…is…is that some sort of anomalous monster?”
“Oh, uh, no it’s my…it’s a…it’s…my roommate…I guess…I think he’s playing what’s known as ‘Shoegaze’.” Dr. Anthalt looked at his wall, which muffled the sound of a wailing guitar on the other side. Since Niles&#39; old amp had to be left at home, he had been quick to use the one Dr. Anthalt got/stole.

“It sounds atrocious.” 05-9 said.
“Well…he…his father…it’s…he’s 13…and going through a lot…you know how it is…ma’am.”
“When I was 13, I was working in a textile factory.”
“What?”
“It’s not important. However, about your proposal…the foundation currently has enough on our hands. We don’t have the time for naming science wings or camps.”
There was a pause.
“I…okay…ma’am.”
“I’m glad you agree. And if you wish to become an 05, I would suggest using the more formal ‘alright’ as opposed to ‘okay’. Goodbye.” With that, she hung up.

Dr. Anthalt tossed his phone aside. It landed right underneath the smoke detector with the bug in it. 

After he discovered the bugs a week ao, he had told Niles about it through a note. Niles had responded with a note saying “05 council sucks”. The two of them had proceeded to share similar notes. For some reason, Dr. Anthalt had begun keeping the notes Niles gave him beneath his bed.
_______

“I talked with 05-9 today.”
Dr. Anthalt and Niles sat at their usual space in the cafeteria, eating stale meatloaf. 
“That’s…one of the leading people, right?” Niles responded.
“Yeah. She overheard you playing. Said your music was good.”
“Really?” Niles asked.
“Yeah, and she doesn’t usually give compliments.”
Dr. Anthalt wasn’t sure, but it looked like Niles was blushing a little bit.
“Maybe you could be the official rock star of the foundation.” Dr. Anthalt continued, then immediately regretted it. For some reason, the idea of Niles working for the foundation put a sour taste in his mouth.
He decided to change the subject. “So…uh…how was school?”
“As usual. It’s kind of impossible to teach both 5 year olds and 15 year olds at the same time.” Niles responded.

________

//The witch and her team, which had grown to include 2970, confronted ..|…..|..|. in the Falkland islands.// 

//Meanwhile, 2972 suddenly disappeared from its usual spot in Sebastopol, Crimea and moved to Sebastopol, California.//

//Due to various different bathtubs randomly developing the properties of 729, Marble Bath, The Foundation ordered the removal of all bathtubs from foundation facilities.//

//Flooding continued.//

//October 15th, 2019
In the center of the Indian ocean, water churned. In the great blue abyss below, a shadow lurked. This shadow grew and grew till it broke the surface. Miles and miles of skin touched air for the first time in millennia. Then, an eye popped out of the water, followed by another eye. 
Swimming in these eyes was an infinite net of memories, all contained in the vast fractal of humanity.// 

//Then, the eyes dipped back beneath the pulsing waves, only to then reappear a few feet ahead. Anantashesha was on the move.//

________

In Sri Lanka, a crowd of people stood on a cliff. They formed two squares, with a path in between. Through this path walked four people, each holding a massive sack of ashes. Most people had given up on funerals, but not here, in the town of Kalametiya. They simply made them more efficient.

The two monks who had lived in the town were currently in two of the sacks, and the ones in neighboring towns were busy. As a result, one of the town members had printed a piece of paper off of the internet. She had done it about a week beforehand, thankfully, as the internet had shut down a few days ago, and the power had gone off the day after that. Apparently, the power had gone off for a majority of the world.

In the back of the crowd, Sriansh stood, his crutches sinking into the mud. 

One by one, the bags were emptied into the sea. As they were, a chant was read. 

One of the children noticed it first, and pointed. When the others looked, they all gasped.

On the horizon lay a massive scowl that was slowly growing into the face of an eel. In the front of it was a massive blue wave, heading straight for the cliff.
Some ran. 
Others, including Sriansh, were simply tired.

One of the bags had not been emptied into the ocean.
“Quick,” one of the town members shouted in Sindhala. “Say the prayer before it comes!”
The bag was emptied, and the prayer quickly said. Then, and only then, did the last few stragglers begin to run.

Sriansh knew he would not make it. His breathing had already become ragged and heavy. Then, someone grabbed him. He was being carried, away from the shore. 

Unfortunately, none of this mattered when the eel opened its mouth, and a cry like steel scraping against iron rang out.

 Skin and bones melted. Red blood turned to black. Tendons unwound. His mind fell through the spiral, into the grey eyes of Anantashesha. He saw eons stretching before him. Amid the billions of fractals of light, an image from the view of an angel with a flaming sword, the messenger of Anatanesha, briefly flashed. However, it, like all light, passed him by, till there was only silence.

All was darkness, but it didn’t matter. Everything was gone, ghosts were all that was left.

_________

//Anatanesha showed the newfound ability to send pulses through its mouth that turned about 500 million people into massive piles of black goo which bore resemblance to amnestic material. This goo appeared to contain some form of consciousness, as it reacted to stimuli.//

//Anantanesha was then attacked by The Witch and her team, which now included two new members. One of these members was a massive ball of energy believed to have once been the girl that was the source of 3002. The other one was Murphy Law.// 

//When the dust settled, a massive eel corpse rubbed against the Indian Subcontinent.//

//On this same day, all Ikeas all over the world exploded.//

//Hard candies were found littering the ground all over Saudi Arabia.//

//It was also discovered that the heads of The Chaos Insurgency were all killed by 3033s, cybernetically modified humans.// 

//Multiple reports of creatures similar to 2636 were reported in Cuba. They were all terminated in a manner similar to the situation with Cyprus.//
_______

Dr. Anthalt was awakened by the sound of a phone ringing. The computer keyboard had left a mark on his skin, and the screen read “y6777777776y7777777777777777777y6667777777777u666666666666666666”.
He picked up his phone. “Hello?” he asked.
“I have good news.” It was 05-9
“Oh, what? Uhh…I mean, what is it, ma;am?”
“You’re going to be on the 05 council.”
“I…really? Because of 05-7?”
“No,” 05-9 said. “Dr. Clef has filled that spot. But a new one is about to open.”
“Why?”
“Because,” 05-9s voice was devoid of emotion. “I’m going to kill 05-11.”
“What?”
“That shrew is always out to get me. She actually wanted to promote Dr. Bright to 05 status. Listen, me and 05-3 have a little alliance. 05-4, 05-6, and 05-10 are also part of this alliance, and now 05-7 is. If I get you on my side then our alliance will have 7 members. That means we will have a majority of the council, because there are 13 members. Do you understand?”
Dr. Anthalt was torn between shouting “I know how math works!” and just staring ahead and nervously fiddling with his pencil.
He chose the second one.
“Do you understand?” 05-9 repeated.
“You can’t…this connection isn’t…” That was all Dr. Anthalt could think of to say.
“It’s secure, don’t worry. Look, I have other options, okay? I chose you, and specifically you.”
“Murder?” 
“You have committed murder. So have I. So have all of us. We have the words ‘cold not cruel’ inscribed onto plaques. This is for the greater good of humanity. And, you will become an 05. The perks of that are endless, both for you and your ‘roomate’.” She pronounced the word ‘plaques’ with a strange accent that Dr. Anthalt had never heard of.
“Uhhh…can I get back to you? Back to you…ma’am?”
“You have two days to make your decision.” With that, the call ended.

Dr. Anthalt sighed. He needed to take more of the anti-sleeping pills. 

His eyes gazed at the fluorescent tube on the ceiling. He had stopped keeping track of the people he had killed a long time ago. There were just grains of blood red sand, slowly piling up. But, he was saving one life, wasn’t he?

//October 16th, 2019
3069, To Force the Hand of God, began to emerge from the North Atlantic Ocean, secreting vast amounts of an unidentified red liquid.//

//Meanwhile, accounts of people suffering strange symptoms after reading books including “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”, “Animal Farm” ,“Things Fall Apart” , and “Persuasion”. A few days after this, The Toundation realized the titles of all of these books had an amount of letters divisible by 5. The symptoms were the same as those suffering from 3125.
As a result, all books whose titles had an amount of letters divisible by 5 were banned.
By the time this occurred, there were already hundreds of thousands of casualties.//


//Even with Anantashesha dead, flooding continued.//

______________

It was another hot day in San Salvador.

Niles lay in his room and stared up at the ceiling. Through a thick layer of paint, he could make out the imprints of plastic stars. They were probably painted over before the foundation repurposed the apartment. After all, it would make no sense for the foundation to feel the need to paint over the stars themselves.

He should have been at the camp’s school by now, but it didn’t matter. It was very easy to lie to Dr. Anthalt. Some people might have been sending him messages about Niles&#39; truancy, but reading messages seemed to be another weakness of Dr. Anthalt.

Dr. Anthalt wasn’t a very good liar himself. He would always tap his foot when he did so. 

As Niles continued to stare at the buried fake stars, something in him snapped. He jumped up onto his bed and reached his hand out, his fingers making contact with the ceiling. Then, he began scraping, tiny scraps of paint falling away.

_______

When Dr. Anthalt got back to his apartment, he immediately plopped down into the uncomfortable kitchen chair. He had tried to improve it with a pillow, but that just made it so his back had to be in a strange position. Overall, his back was hurting far more than it ever had previously. Perhaps it was because he had suddenly gone off T, or perhaps it was because he did not have anyone to tell him to sit up straight.

He got out his computer. Recently, he had switched to being completely digital. However, he was interrupted when he finally noticed a sound. It was sobbing, coming from behind a closed door. He went up to it and knocked. “Hello?”
His only response was soft sobbing coming from the other side of the door.
“Hello? Niles? Do you want me to come in?” No response.
Dr. Anthalt sighed before opening the door.
Inside was Niles, his face covered with tears. He was lying on the floor, surrounded by flecks of paint and fingernails. The tips of his fingers were bleeding. The ceiling was a mess of ruptured paint and blood, with fake plastic stars finally breathing.

“Oh…” was all Dr. Anthalt could say.
He moved towards Niles like he was a dangerous anomaly.
“Hey…uhhh…uhhh…are you okay?”
“What do you think?”
“I…uhhh…band-aids…do…”
“Not gonna offer me water?” Niles asked in a choking laugh.
“Uhhh…if you want some.”
“I don’t want fucking water!” Niles barked. He turned his back to Dr. Anthalt.

A moment passed, then Dr. Anthalt spoke. He lowered his voice, just like he’d seen Dr. Kyrokon do.
“Uhhh…you’re Dad. Before he died, we got into a fight and he, well he was right. I see that now…but…uh…he…oh god…I don’t know…and…I mean it doesn’t matter now…I have no other choice…but…before he died he left me a message…on his phone…and I…I fu…I didn’t hear it. He was…he was asking me for help. And I…I never got back to him. If only I had stopped what I was doing for a second and looked at my phone. Well then, I…I don’t know.”


Niles didn’t move. “You don’t need to do this.”
“That couldn’t be more untrue.”
There was a pause.
“Can I ask you a question?”
“You already did.”
Niles turned around to stare at Dr. Anthalt.
“Sorry. Yeah. You can.” Dr. Anthalt stammered.
“Do you have parents?”
Dr. Anthalt chuckled. “My Dad was a drunk who died when I was 11. A little after that, my Mom sent me off to a boarding school. Neither of them were really interested in raising me, I guess.”
“Oh. Sorry.”
Dr. Anthalt shrugged. “That’s life. Now, I think maybe we should get you some bandages.”
“Listen,” Niles sniffed. “I’m not a baby. I don’t need to be swaddled, and I don’t need to be lied to.”
“Okay, that’s fine.”
“And you don’t have to be a replacement dad.”
“Okay, sure, I’ll be your older, more maturer adult friend.”

The two staired uncomfortably at each other for a few seconds. “You know,” Dr. Anthalt. “I think I could manage to find some ice cream…would that be nice? I’m asking as a friend. I also want some too…”

The tapeworm people had started what they called the “Neo-Daevite Empire”, spanning a large part of central and eastern Africa. It should be noted this was nowhere where the Daevite empire was.//

//Numerous instances of 3199, Humans Refuted, appeared all over the world, leading to a death toll in the millions.//

//Meanwhile, a large obelisk appeared above Brazil and started playing The Song of Genesis until the foundation shot it down. The obelisk appeared to be made out of normal non-anomalous cardboard.//

//About 800,000 civilians were affected by the obelisk.//

__________

“No.” Dr. Anthalt said.
“No?” 05-9s eyes grew from behind her horned rimmed glasses.
“Sorry…ma’am…but, I don’t think I’m the right man for the job.”
She sighed. “I don’t have time for this. What do you want?”
“Nothing. I don’t want anything...ma’am. Well, actually, no, there’s a bunch of openings in the science positions. I could just do some research stuff…not kill anyone…that would be nice.”

05-9 didn’t say anything. Instead, she simply took off her glasses. As she did, there was a snapping of electricity. She closed her eyes and opened them again, revealing gray spheres.
“Don’t fuck with me.” she snarled.
No words emerged from Dr. Anthalt’s open mouth.
“I don’t want to play games.” 05-9 grumbled.
“What…what?”
“Your pea-sized brain can not even begin to comprehend what I have done to people far greater than you. So, I will ask you once again, what do you want?”
“I told you what I want. I want to have a nice, simple, research job and…I want my son to be safe. I mean not son…I meant…I…”
05-9 laughed, then put her glasses back on. There was the sound of electricity as her eyes changed back to normal. “You know, not many people say no to me.”
“So…uhh…”
“Sure, you will get exactly what you want.”
“Are you…mad at me?” Dr. Anthalt asked.
“Of course I am. However, saying no to me guarantees its own punishment. However, worrying is a waste of brain cells, and you’re in rather low supply.”
05-9 went to the wall, where she got out a small box. From it, she took out a small grey bag, small enough to fit into a pocket.
“If you ever change your mind, open this.”
_____

Niles was practicing in his room when he heard a knock at the door. “Yes?” It was opened by Dr. Anthalt.
“Hey.” He said, holding up a small grey bag. “Want to have a cold coin?” 
“Uhhh…sure?”
“Cool, here you go. Is that Bela Lugosi’s Dead?” Dr. Anthalt tossed the bag to Niles.
“Yeah.”
“Sounds cool. Very gothic.” 
Dr. Anthalt then closed the door. When Niles opened the bag, it was not a gold coin he found, but a guitar pick. If it was some sort of joke then it wasn’t funny. Still, he hadn’t bought a guitar pick with him.

The fan on the ceiling of the A.F.F. command center was far too loud. All eyes were turned towards the front of the room, where Commander-3 was pointing at a screen.
“San Salvador,” she said. “Approximately 4,000 foundation officials are there, including 05-9. And, we’re gonna fuck it up.”

Commander-3 was nine feet tall, with massive red veins running through her skin, leading to pure red eyes. 
It had been 5 months since she and the others had stolen the armored vehicle. During that time, she had been extremely busy and very lucky. Thoughts of modern day interpretations of Shakespeare plays had barely even crossed her mind.

She continued to speak. The entire mission plan had already been spelled out in detail. Now, she was just summarizing. It was a good tactic for speech giving she had learned at a rhetoric class. A button on the projector was clicked, and an image of a green liquid appeared on the screen. Unfortunately, Powerpoint was not available.

“This is a much more dangerous kind of 1100, also known as Gaia’s Blood. The ordinary version simply has the ability to contort life, but this version has been augmented to produce a very specific effect. On Halloween, we will not just make it rain fire down on the oppressors. We will give them a taste of their own medicine. Now, they will know what it is like to be monsters.”

Everyone in the room cheered, but it was impossible to tell if they truly enjoyed her presentation, or were simply trying to please their boss. It was one of the many annoyances of leadership.

“Velcome to my castle!” Dr. Anthalt hooted. He had draped a black sheet over his back.

“What are you doing?” Niles asked. He was sitting on his bed, guitar and pick in hand. 
“I am Count Dracula! It’s Halloween. Yes, the victims have been bled…ooohhh.” It was easy for Dr. Anthalt to do a Dracula voice, as he merely needed to bring his natural accent back.
“Don’t you have work to do?” 


Dr Anthalt dropped the accent. “Nah. I finished it early. I’ve gotten less stuff lately. But now is not the time for work, it’s the time for spooks and haunts!”
“You do realize the ridiculousness of what you’re saying?”
Dr. Anthalt’s smile struggled to hold itself. “C’mon…you know…they have this thing over at the cafeteria. There’s bobbing for ears of corn, because they ran out of apples, and some candy too, I think…It’s not amazing or anything, but it’s something. I’m sure we can throw together a costume for you. Maybe you could be an undead rockstar…or something.”
“What is wrong with you?”
“It’s Halloween!”
Niles sighed. “Please get out of my room.”
“Fine,” Dr. Anthalt huffed. “Maybe I’ll go to the super cool party all by myself. Farewell, darlink!”

With a dramatic turn of his cape, he stomped off. His steps took him through the main room, past the two gas masks hanging on the wall.

The second the door to the apartment closed, Dr. Anthalt fell against the wall and sighed. He grabbed the sheet and threw it to the floor. “Oh, god I’m an idiot.”

He looked up at the ceiling. “How did you do it, huh? How does anyone do it?”
His head rubbed against the back of the wall. “You know what? He wants to be alone. That’s fine. Whatever. He’s had enough Dadding for his life. I had 11 years of a Dad and that was enough for me! Why should I even give a shit about him? You know, I don’t give a shit! I’m just guilty or some psychological shit or whatever. He could die and I w-”
He was interrupted by an explosion and a great shaking.

“Shit!” his voice ran like a hammer against an anvil. The sheet, still in his hand, did a black dance as he dashed back into the room.

The wall had fallen off. At the edge of the floorboard was a 30 meter drop to the ground. Screeches of smoke flooded through the room. 
“Niles! Niles!”

Dr. Anthat’s legs were lightning as he stormed above the screaming floor. The door to Niles&#39; room fell to wooden scraps as he opened it.

Niles was inside, his eyes large as dinner plates, huddled on his bed. His guitar was on the floor, and a pick was in his hand.
“Are you hurt?” Dr. Anthalt screamed.
Niles shook his head.
“We need to get out!” Dr. Anthalt screeched.
Niles followed these instructions by jumping onto the floor, landing on the crack between two floorboards, and crashing through. His head plummeted out of sight beneath the floor.

Dr. Anthalt shrieked. When he looked through the hole, he found Niles, two stories below, howling on a floor. Red dripped from his knee onto the hardwood floor. 
“Stay right there!” Dr. Anthalt yelled below.

He ran, making sure not to step on the cracks on the floorboards. His eyes caught one of the gas masks, lying on the floor, and he quickly grabbed it before continuing to sprint. 
When he got to the stairs, he found a large pile of rubble in his way. He turned around, heading for the fire escape. Thankfully, it had not been harmed. The sounds of explosions in the distance were joined by the sound of his shoes slapping against the steel stairs. 

Once he had arrived at the correct story of the building, he had to find the correct room. He drew the building’s layout on his mind. Then, he realized that he would just need to follow the same path he used to get to the fire escape, but reversed.

Eventually, he found his way to a door. “Niles! Are you there?” he screamed.
A response came in the form of another scream.

He ran up and gave it a kick, trying to knock it open. The only thing he got was a cracking pain from his foot. His second try was met by a second failure. He was about to try for the third time when he realized that the door might not have been locked. This turned out to be true.

When the door opened, it revealed a crumbling precipice above an abyss of smoke and flame. On this precipice, Niles lay. The guitar had also fallen with him, and its smashed remains now lay next to him.
“Niles!” Dr. Anthalt screamed.
Niles gestured to the abyss. Within the grey smoke came another form of gas, this one green.

“Here!” Dr. Anthralt handed the gas mask to Niles then studied his leg. Through the puddle of red, an island of white stood. Thankfully, it seemed to be the biggest victim of the fall.
“Shit…I mean shoot.” he grumbled. He realized, for some reason, he was still holding onto the black sheet. He ripped off part of it and wrapped it around Niles’ leg.
“Can you walk?”
“I…I…”
“Well…we’ll have to try.”
The cloud of green gas was starting to expand. Through it and the smoke, Dr. Anthalt could make out human silhouettes being stretched and contorted.

“Grab my hand!” Dr. Anthalt yelled at Niles, who complied. He leaned against Dr. Anthalt. 
“Okay, now, we’re gonna have to walk!”

The green gas was getting closer and closer.
The two of them stumbled out the door, back into the hallway of the apartment. “Shouldn’t you have a mask?” Niles asked.
“I only saw one. It doesn’t matter. We have to get out of this building.”

There was another explosion. Parts of the ceiling began to fall down.

Dr. Anthalt led Niles towards the fire escape, grabbing a fire extinguisher as he walked. “As a weapon.” he muttered.

The ceiling continued to shed as they found the fire escape. They began to step down, only for someone wearing red armor with a red gas mask to appear before him. Before the red figure could do anything, Dr. Anthalt chucked the fire extinguisher at them. It hit the person in the chest with a soft bonk, sending them tumbling down the stairs. When the armored person finished falling, there was a loud crack.

Niles and Dr. Anthalt continued to run hobble downwards. Eventually, they made their way to a door which opened to reveal a world of ash and turbulence. Screams and smoke filled the air, choking the world in a chaotic frenzy.

Helicopters could be seen, jumping between crumbling pillars of ash. What drew Dr. Anthalt’s and Nile’s eyes were the various black tree-like entities littered around the rubble. Thankfully, the green gas seemed to have gone away, leaving only a smoke soaked sky.

“We need to make it to the back road. There will be cars there, okay?”
Niles nodded.
They continued to hobble.

A mob of men in black armor ran past them. “Civilians on the back road!” one of them shouted.
“I’m not a civilian, and I was already going there.” Dr. Anthalt mumbled to himself as he continued to move forward.

Behind them, there was an explosion. When both of them turned to look, they saw a helicopter on fire, and the men in black armor burning with it. 
“Shit, I mean shoot! Faster!” Dr. Anthalt said.
“I’m trying!” Niles shouted.
“Goddamnit! Hold on!” Dr. Anthalt then proceeded to grab Niles and lift him into the air.
He then proceeded to shamble forward, tripping over metal and bodies.
“Why are you so fucking heavy!” he yelled.
“I’m not heavy!”
When Dr. Anthalt looked behind him, he saw more men in red, emerging from behind the flaming helicopter. One of them threw an object at the ground, and green gas began to emerge.
“Shit!”
He picked up speed, almost bumping into one of the black trees.

Then in the distance, he spotted a group of cars. 
It was at that point when another helicopter came down, right on top of the cars. The massive fireball caused Dr. Anthalt to lose his grip on Niles, who scrambled as he hit the ground.
“Shit! Sorry!” Dr. Anthalt looked ahead of him, where there was a churning sea of flame. Behind him, the cloud of green gas was expanding, getting dangerously close to him. 

He looked to his left and right, and it was through the smoke that he saw flashing lights behind him.
Having no other choice, he picked up Niles and ran towards the light.
The green gas was catching up to him.

Eventually, the smoke cleared to reveal an armored car, placed on the side of the road.
The second Dr. Anthalt saw it was the second when he inhaled the gas. He continued to run, before his legs suddenly turned to wax, a few feet away from the front of the car.
 Niles screamed from on the sidewalk.
“I…I,” Dr. Anthat attempted to get up, but gravity won the battle.
The car sped till it was right next to them.
The door briefly swung open, and Niles felt himself being yanked into the car.
“Go…go!” Dr. Anthalt yelled as his eyes turned white.
The door slammed shut. 

“Wait!” Niles screamed from inside. The gas mask-hidden faces floating around him offered no solace. 

As the car sped away, Dr. Anthalt lay on the ground, his body twitching like a dying snake. With the sound of flesh expanding, his tongue grew, forcing his mouth open as it widened. The long red tendril danced in the air before turning black and beginning to divide, turning into a structure similar to a tree. Dr. Anthalt’s skin began to snap as multiple hands began to burst out of his back. The fingers of these hands stretched out, reaching for nothing.

His jaw snapped in half as his tongue continued to expand. The growth of hands spread through his body, his legs and arms and neck all being overtaken. His head began to crinkle, forming a ring around the base of his tongue. The last thing he saw before his eyes were crushed between his tongue and his brain was the armored car, turned into a speck in the distance.

Then, darkness devoured all. In less than a minute, Dr. Anthalt had been replaced by a giant black tree with twisting roots made of fingers. 

When the fingers of flames began to scratch through what was once his skin, he held no fear. The last image to enter his mind were two faces.</textarea></pre>
