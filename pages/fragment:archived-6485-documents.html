= **Interview Log 6485.1**
----

**Interviewed:** SCP-6485

**Interviewer:** Dr. Jonas

**Foreword:** As SCP-6485 is incapable of producing any vocalisations, it is allowed to write its&#39; answers on a whiteboard provided. All future logs including SCP-6485 will be logged in a similar way.
----

[BEGIN LOG]

**Dr. Jonas:** SCP-6485, are you able to understand what I am saying?

//SCP-6485 nods its&#39; head.//

**Dr. Jonas:** Are you able to communicate through speech?

//SCP-6485 shakes its head and makes a writing gesture. Silence follows for approximately thirty seconds as Dr. Jonas searches for, and takes out a whiteboard and marker.//

**Dr. Jonas:** Can you write something on the whiteboard?

**SCP-6485:** Alright.

**Dr. Jonas:** Can you introduce yourself?

**SCP-6485:** I am Charlie&#39;s teddy bear! I was a gift to him for his 3rd birthday and he loved me so much! We spent so much time together and he never left home without me! However, as we grew up, he stopped playing with me as much and he threw me away after leaving to live with his girlfriend.

**Dr. Jonas:** Are there other instances of you appearing elsewhere?

**SCP-6485:** No, I don&#39;t think so.

**Dr. Jonas:** What did you remember after you manifested?

**SCP-6485:** I remember that after she noticed me in her bedroom, she got a call. I&#39;m assuming that it was to break the news to her as she fainted after picking it up. When I woke her up, she was muttering about how he couldn&#39;t possibly be dead before she started laughing about how stupid she was for believing the call.

**Dr. Jonas:** She thought that the call from Dr. Agnes was a lie? Did you try to convince her otherwise?

**SCP-6485:** She was only on the call for half a minute so I don&#39;t think the caller had time to convince her or explain. I tried to do it myself but she continued ignoring me until you brought her here, so I waited for the news to settle in.

**Dr. Jonas:** So, while you were waiting for her to process the news, what did you do?

**SCP-6485:** Seeing as how I couldn&#39;t convince her, I observed her daily routine so I could help her fall back into it before she alters it too much when she is grieving.

**Dr. Jonas:** Why exactly are you so keen on helping her in the first place?

//SCP-6485 pauses for a moment and scratches its&#39; head.//

**SCP-6485:** I want to provide physical companionship and lend a listening ear to her as she has no one else to grieve to. I don&#39;t want her to hurt herself or bottle up any feelings because she has nobody to turn to.

**Dr. Jonas:** How do you know that she has no one to turn to?

**SCP-6485:** She was living alone in her house and barely went out while I was there so I assume that she doesn&#39;t have anybody to reach out to.

**Dr. Jonas:** I see. Thank you for your time, SCP-6485.

**Interviewed:** Lily Upston (referred to as &#34;Ms. Upston&#34;)

**Interviewer:** Dr. Jonas
----

[BEGIN LOG]

**Dr. Jonas:** Good morning, Ms. Upston.

**Ms. Upston:** Good morning.

**Dr. Jonas:** I am Dr. Jonas, Mr. Upston&#39;s colleague. Could you tell me more about where you found the teddy bear?

**Ms. Upston:** Well… I saw it sitting on my bed after my morning jog. It freaked me out a little as I remember… it could not sit up straight when Charlie had it, and it was thrown away when he moved out.

**Dr. Jonas:** When did you first notice that something was out-of-the-ordinary?

**Ms. Upston:** I got a call from someone who I assume to be his colleague telling me that Charlie was dead. I… I fainted from the shock and woke up on my bed somehow, and that was when I noticed the bear pressing a wet towel on my face.

I freaked out after realising that I was not imagining things and threw it out of my window, but when I turned back, it… it was on my bed. Then, I tried running out of the house… but it was on my dining table when I got to the first floor!

**Dr. Jonas:** Do you recall your conversation with the caller?

**Ms. Upston:** How could I forget? It was horrible. I couldn&#39;t understand her as she was crying and apologising over and over before I had time to prepare. When I finally asked her what had happened, she told me that Charlie was dead. I fainted and by the time I woke up, she had already hung up on me.

**Dr. Jonas:** Did you try calling her back?

**Ms. Upston:** //Ms. Upston shakes her head.// It was probably a joke so I just didn&#39;t bother.

**Dr. Jonas:** //Dr. Jonas sighs.// There&#39;s no easy way of explaining this...

**Ms. Upston:** Huh? What do you mean?

**Dr. Jonas:** It wasn&#39;t a joke. I&#39;m so, so sorry, Ms. Upston, but he is gone.

**Ms. Upston:** What? You... You&#39;re lying, right? Why would you say such a thing?

**Dr. Jonas:** I found his dead body next to Dr. Agnes, the person who called you last week. He was killed when a specimen escaped from our laboratory and broke through one of the walls. Unfortunately, Dr. Upston was standing on the opposite side when it broke free and was killed by it.

**Ms. Upston:** No, no, no, no, no, he isn&#39;t dead. Not after... not after he promised to me that he would keep himself safe after his... his... //Ms. Upston begins crying.// No! No! He is fine! He&#39;s in his office right now! Right? Right? //Ms. Upston stands up and hits the table.// Fucking answer me! You people have a lot of fucking nerve to force him to stay back during the Thanksgiving break until the point where he stopped responding to my calls and didn&#39;t visit me even after he told me that he took some time off to return!

//Dr. Jonas crosses his arms and stares silently at Ms. Upston. She pauses for a second before her expression changes to one of realisation as she slowly falls back to her chair.//

Oh my... oh my god... Charlie... Charlie, no! CHARLIE! //Ms. Upston begins sobbing uncontrollably.// CHARLIE! My poor baby... It can&#39;t be...

//SCP-6485 manifests next to her and begins to rub her back. It then proceeds to look up at Dr. Jonas and shakes its head. Dr. Jonas sighs, stands up and walks to the camera and turns it off.//

//The door to Ms. Upston&#39;s room opens and SCP-6485 and she walks in. She collapses to the floor, crying loudly as SCP-6485 closes the door and attempts to console her. Dr. Jonas opens the door slightly and attempts to enter, but SCP-6485 peeks its head out of the door and shakes it before closing the door again.//

**Ms. Upston:** //&lt;incomprehensible&gt;// I&#39;ll kill them! I&#39;ll fucking kill each and everyone who caused Charlie to die! Why didn&#39;t they keep him safe? Why did they let this happen?

//Ms. Upston continues to cry and scream for the next five minutes. Dialogue is incomprehensible and unintelligible.//

**Ms. Upston:** Charlie... Charlie why... You promised you&#39;d stay with me! Why did you leave mummy so soon? Why did you let this happen?

**Notes:** Following her interview, Ms. Upston became uncooperative with foundation personnel and has refused to partake in further interviews. All attempts at conversation with her have been deemed ineffective.

The following is a video log of a negotiation done between SCP-6485 and Dr. Jonas two days after the events during and following **Interview Log 6485.2**.

[BEGIN LOG]

**Dr. Jonas:** Good evening, SCP-6485. How is Ms. Upston doing?

**SCP-6485:** Terrible. She has been crying non-stop in her bed for the past two weeks. I haven&#39;t left her side much because I am afraid of her hurting herself. But, I’ve been managing to get her to sleep more often for the past few days.

//SCP-6485 looks up and notices Dr. Jonas’ expression.//

**SCP-6485:** You don’t have to apologise, she was bound to find out sooner or later.

**Dr. Jonas:** Alright... Do you know why I&#39;ve called you here?

//SCP-6485 shakes its head.//

**Dr. Jonas:** Ms. Upston has been uncooperative to our requests over the past few weeks and she has refused to talk to anyone that isn&#39;t you. So, I am trying to come up with a compromise that will allow us to keep track of her emotional wellbeing while giving her some time alone to grieve.

**SCP-6485:** Well, that should be expected. She is still trying to understand what happened. It will probably take days, weeks, maybe even months before she is fully able to get a grip on her feelings. Trying to force it out of her will only make things worse. Maybe you could interview me instead and I could tell you what we&#39;ve done together!

**Dr. Jonas:** I&#39;ve thought of that, but I prefer that she herself tell us her genuine feelings as she could fake it when she is around you. I am just not so sure whether you will be able to read her feelings properly enough to give a proper summary. However, if you are able to do so, feel free to tell me.

//SCP-6485 stays silent for a minute before it begins writing its&#39; response.//

**SCP-6485:** Maybe, I could still help? How about a weekly checkup? Why don&#39;t you give me some questions I can ask? Then, you can record our sessions and use that instead of interviews. It doesn&#39;t seem like she&#39;s in the mood to talk with anyone from your foundation.

**Dr. Jonas:** Alright, then. Thank you so much for helping.

**SCP-6485:** You&#39;re welcome. See you soon.

//SCP-6485 wipes its whiteboard, jumps off the chair and waves at Dr. Jonas.//

//The door to Ms. Upston&#39;s room opens and SCP-6485 walks in with a piece of paper and its&#39; whiteboard. She can be seen lying awake on her bed staring at the wall. Her eyes are noticeably red with rings under her eyelids as well. Her breakfast can be seen untouched and uneaten at the foot of her bed. SCP-6485 walks towards her bed and climbs on to it before shaking her.//

**SCP-6485:** Good afternoon, Ms. Upston! How are you feeling?

//Ms. Upston does not respond.//

**SCP-6485:** How are you doing today?

//Ms. Upston does not seem to notice SCP-6485 and does not respond. SCP-6485 places its whiteboard down and shakes her, causing her to turn towards it. She rubs her eyes and looks at the whiteboard.//

**Ms. Upston:** //&lt;tiredly&gt;// I’m fine, I’m fine. Leave me alone, please…

//Ms. Upston attempts to lie down but is stopped by SCP-6485.//

**Ms. Upston:** What do you want?

**SCP-6485:** I just want to know how you’re feeling.

**Ms. Upston:** I told you already, I’m fine!

**SCP-6485:** Have you eaten your breakfast yet?

//It turns to look at the tray of uneaten food, climbs down the bed and picks up a mug of coffee. It climbs back onto the bed and passes it to Ms. Upston.//

**SCP-6485:** Drink it. Have you showered?

**Ms. Upston:** Why are you so concerned? Just leave me be, alright?

**SCP-6485:** No, I won&#39;t. I want to know how you’re feeling so I can help you.

**Ms. Upston:** Help? Alright, you can help me by leaving me alone.

**SCP-6485:** I told you, already, I can’t and I won’t do that. I understand if you want to grieve alone, but we cannot just stay here and do nothing. I want to help you cope with the news and help you get better, but I can’t help you if you don’t tell me what’s wrong. I know that you want to leave this place, but we can’t do so unless you cooperate.

**Ms. Upston:** Fine, I’ll do it. If I answer your questions, will you leave me alone for the rest of the day?

**SCP-6485:** Yes.

**Ms. Upston:** //&lt;defeated&gt;// Alright then, go on.

//SCP-6485 quickly looks at a piece of paper before turning back to Ms. Upston.//

**SCP-6485:** Have you seen a therapist before this?

**Ms. Upston:** I attended sessions for a month after... something happened, but I stopped going after.

**SCP-6485:** Why is that so?

**Ms. Upston:** It gets expensive quickly and I couldn&#39;t afford it. Even when I could, I tried my best to go weekly, but given where I was at mentally, there were times I couldn&#39;t bring myself to go, despite me trying to force myself to go. I... I also had to be there for Charlie so... I guess... //Ms. Upston gestures.// I had to put on a front? Force myself to be okay so that he wouldn&#39;t worry. Also, he was... he was also dealing with depression because of that same incident, so I had to try my best to help him out of that. But, now he&#39;s gone... //Ms. Upston stays silent.//

**SCP-6485:** Do you mind telling me when you first heard the news?

**Ms. Upston:** I received a call about a couple of weeks ago from his colleague. She was... She was crying, screaming &#34;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry&#34;, it was just... just awful. After telling her to calm down, she managed to choke out that Charlie was... he was gone. I got a little light-headed from the suddenness of the news and fainted. When I woke up, she had hung up already.

**SCP-6485:** I&#39;ve heard that you thought that it was a joke? Why would you think that it was one?

**Ms. Upston:** I just didn&#39;t want to believe it. I think the suddenness of the call and how I was immediately overwhelmed with her emotions played a part in me not believing it.

**SCP-6485:** Did you consider, in any point of time between receiving the call to you being brought here, that the contents of the call might have been true?

**Ms. Upston:** I did have a small gut feeling that slowly got worse the more I... I... //&lt;sighs&gt;// I tried to contact him. //&lt;silence&gt;// It got worse when Thanksgiving came and he didn&#39;t visit me like he had promised. His girlfriend called me a day before asking if I had seen him, which confused me because I thought he would be with her already. When I tried contacting him, he didn&#39;t answer my messages or calls, and that was when I seriously considered that he... the worst might have happened.

Nevertheless, I tried staying positive and tried convincing myself that he was probably held back over the holidays at work. When I was brought here, though, the dread and worry slowly got worse and worse, even when I was fighting so hard to deny it. It got to a point where I couldn&#39;t take it anymore and ended up letting it all out during my initial interview.

**SCP-6485:** I see. Even with that thought that he might be dead, why did you try so hard to deny it?

//Ms. Upston stays silent for two minutes before talking.//

**Ms. Upston:** I... I don&#39;t want to talk about it. It hurts... It fucking hurts so much to think about it. Trying to force myself to think everything was alright... trying to tell myself he was fine... It just hurts.

**SCP-6485:** Okay, we&#39;ll move on. Would you have acted any differently during that interview if you believed the call immediately?

**Ms. Upston:** No. I can&#39;t imagine myself believing it so quickly and I would probably have tried everything to deny that. Even if I could, I... I probably would have let out all that pent-up emotion and would have just ended up the same as I am now.

//Ms. Upston stays silent for another minute before continuing.//

//&lt;quietly&gt;// I’m so sorry, but I really don’t know what else to say. Is this… is this good enough?

**SCP-6485:** What do you mean?

**Ms. Upston:** It’s just… Everything just happened so quickly. Like, I just heard news that Charlie died and now, only a few days later, I am here having a therapy session with a fucking teddy bear that moves and “talks”. I barely had anytime to make sense of my emotions or grieve, and now I have to… //Ms. Upston gestures.// try and find a way to explain it when I have no clue how to.

//SCP-6485 places the piece of paper aside.//

**SCP-6485:** Forget about this. If it helps, why not take this less as a therapy session and more of a safe space where you can try to make more sense of your feelings?

//Ms. Upston stays silent for several minutes. Just as SCP-6485 begins to write, she speaks up.//

**Ms. Upston:** You know… it’s just so unfair. Just when things were looking up for him, he… //Ms. Upston shakes her head as her voice cracks.// passed away. Why, why him? He had such a bright future ahead of him. Why couldn’t it have been me instead? I lived a good life already…

**SCP-6485:** Why are you saying that? Don’t you have anybody back there? Your husband, maybe?

//Ms. Upston stays silent as SCP-6485 quickly erases its response.//

**Ms. Upston:** I was really excited to meet him again, y’know? When I heard that he was offered an internship here, I was so happy for him! I was so excited to hear about the things he had done, all the people he met, and all the friends he made. I even bought the ingredients for that special mac-and-cheese he loved so much! Like, finally after half a year of only meeting him through Skype or through calls, I can see him again face-to-face! I didn’t… I didn’t think that he would pass away so soon.

Now, I just wish that I could see him again and tell him how much I love him and how I&#39;m so proud of him. I want to hear his voice again, telling me stories of what he has done with his friends, hearing him gush over his girlfriend, or hear him say, &#34;I love you, mum!&#34; again. I just... I miss him so much. //&lt;silence&gt;// I don’t know… I guess that’s how I really feel. I’m not sure if that’s good enough, but that’s what I can make out at the moment.

**SCP-6485:** That’s fine! It’s okay! We’ve made some progress and that is what matters! Any progress is good progress, and we can always take it one day at a time. Go get some rest, okay?

**Ms. Upston:** Alright.

//SCP-6485 enters Ms. Upston&#39;s room with a tray of food. It sets the tray down next to her bed, climbs on top of her and begins shaking her. Ms. Upston groans, turns around, grabs SCP-6485 and throws it at a wall. She proceeds to cover herself with the blanket as SCP-6485 climbs onto the bed again and sits down next to her. After ten minutes, SCP-6485 shakes her back again and she sits up.//

**Ms. Upston:** What do you want?

//SCP-6485 gestures at the tray and she picks it up. She stares at the food as SCP-6485 grabs the whiteboard and begins writing.//

**SCP-6485:** Good morning! You didn&#39;t seem to be eating as much lately, so I went ahead and made some breakfast for you.

//Ms. Upston picks up a cup from the tray and sips it.//

**Ms. Upston:** How... How do you know that I like this type of coffee?

**SCP-6485:** Lucky guess, I suppose. Once you&#39;re done, you should really go and shower. Our next therapy session starts in an hour.

//Ms. Upston sighs, sets the tray down on the bedside table and throws the blanket over herself.//

**Ms. Upston:** I’m sorry, but I don&#39;t feel like continuing the sessions anymore.

**SCP-6485:** What? I can&#39;t do that! It&#39;s already been confirmed that you would be attending therapy sessions with me. You can&#39;t stop now!

**Ms. Upston:** I can&#39;t... I don&#39;t feel comfortable talking about Charlie anymore.

//SCP-6485 climbs onto the bed and sits down next to Ms. Upston.//

**SCP-6485:** Why is that so?

**Ms. Upston:** Well… I don’t really like how everything... has to be recorded, I guess? Like... I don&#39;t feel like I get the confidentiality of a normal therapy session and I don&#39;t feel comfortable sharing much with Dr. Jonas.

**SCP-6485:** If you don’t feel comfortable sharing information with him, why don’t you share it with me?

**Ms. Upston:** I don’t think that you’re the best... best... No offense, but I just don&#39;t think you&#39;ve shared much common experiences of Charlie with me.

**SCP-6485:** Of course I haven&#39;t, but that doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t share them with me!

//SCP-6485 reaches behind its back and pulls out a photograph. It hands it over to Ms. Upston before it resumes writing.//

**SCP-6485:** Could you tell me about this picture?

**Ms. Upston:** How… How did you get this picture?

**SCP-6485:** What do you mean?

**Ms. Upston:** This picture was destroyed during a fire a few years ago! How… Where did you get this from?

**SCP-6485:** I’m not so sure. It just appeared when I reached behind my back. Could you tell me more about what’s in this picture?

**Ms. Upston:** This… This was taken during his first birthday. It was… It was just so amazing. I was so happy and... I guess, relieved? Like I managed to make it past the first year of parenthood without much difficulty. It was just so surprising how quickly he turned 1!

**SCP-6485:** What about this one? Who is she?

//SCP-6485 passes another picture to Ms. Upston and points at a girl in it.//

**Ms. Upston:** Oh! She&#39;s his girlfriend, Asuka! They grew up together so they were very close. They managed to stay in contact after we moved and they started dating soon after.

//SCP-6485 nods and reaches for another picture.//

**SCP-6485:** What about him?

//Ms. Upston looks at the picture from SCP-6485.//

**Ms. Upston:** That would be his best friend! They met in kindergarten and managed to end up in the same schools together, so they are also very close. //Ms. Upston pauses.// Oh no... How do I tell them he&#39;s gone? They&#39;ve got to be so worried.

**SCP-6485:** I think that there may be similar versions of me showing up to inform them of his death.

**Ms. Upston:** Similar versions?

**SCP-6485:** I overheard an interview between that Jonas guy from earlier and someone else, and she mentioned that her husband and she had something similar to me show up after their child’s death. There could be a chance that a similar version of me manifests after his passing to inform them of it.

**Ms. Upston**: Oh.

**SCP-6485:** I&#39;m curious, with you talking about how Charlie met his best friend and girlfriend, how did you meet your husband?

**Ms. Upston:** Oh, me? I first met him as a client for a project at work. After everything was complete, we continued to talk and meet up and we ended up getting together a couple of months later. The rest was pretty much history. //Ms. Upston stays silent with a small smile on her face.// I fell in love, and when Charlie was born, I fell in love again. It was the happiest 19 years of my life…

**SCP-6485:** Wasn&#39;t Charlie 21 when he passed? Why did you say 19 only?

//Ms. Upston looks away and stays silent. SCP-6485 quickly erases its response and takes out another picture.//

**SCP-6485:** What about this picture?

//Ms. Upston receives the picture from SCP-6485 and begins tearing up once she looks at it. SCP-6485 quickly places a hand in hers as she covers her mouth and starts sobbing. After three minutes, Ms. Upston composes herself and turns to SCP-6485.//

**Ms. Upston:** This is a picture of... of my husband and Charlie. We looked so happy back then…

//SCP-6485 passes a box of tissues to Ms. Upston.//

This was taken during his college graduation and it was one of the happiest days of my life. I was so proud of him! I’d give anything to spend a day with them again… I miss them so much. If only I told him to not go to that party... If only I told him to not accept the job offer here... Maybe they won&#39;t be gone... Maybe I won&#39;t be here… //Ms. Upston begins crying again.// After his father&#39;s death, he promised me he&#39;d never leave me, and that was the one promise I hoped he&#39;d never break, but… //Ms. Upston sobs as SCP-6485, puts down the photographs and hugs her.//

**Ms. Upston:** I&#39;m sorry, I need some space. Could you tell one of the people here that I won’t be going for today’s session?

//SCP-6485 nods and leaves the room. Ms. Upston sobs silently as she sifts through the photograph. She looks at the graduation picture and touches Dr. Upston&#39;s face. She then hugs the stack of pictures as she continues to cry. After nearly thirty minutes, she lies back down on the bed and covers herself with the blanket. She proceeds to cry herself to sleep. SCP-6485 returns to Ms. Upston&#39;s room and notices her lying on the bed. It walks towards her and climbs onto her bed. It gently shakes her for a few seconds before stopping and sits down against her.//

//The door to Ms. Upston&#39;s room opens and SCP-6485 walks in. She can be seen sleeping on her bed, her breakfast untouched and uneaten at the foot of the bed. It climbs onto her bed and gently shakes her. Ms. Upston wakes up, notices SCP-6485 and rubs her eyes.//

**Ms. Upston:** What do you want now?

**SCP-6485:** I&#39;m worried for you. You haven&#39;t been eating a lot and everyone&#39;s been concerned since you haven’t talked much with anyone else.

**Ms. Upston:** Well, you can tell them to stop worrying. I’m fine, I’m fine… I’m fine! Yeah. So, don&#39;t worry about me, alright? Just leave me alone. I’ll figure things out by myself, okay?

**SCP-6485:** I can’t do that. I’ve already done so for two weeks and you haven’t shown any signs of improvement at all. Please… just let me help you, alright?

//SCP-6485 attempts to reach out to Ms. Upston, but is pushed away by her.//

**Ms. Upston:** Help? What do you mean, help? You haven&#39;t done anything ever since you came into my life, so what makes today any different? When I want time to myself so I can grieve alone, you barge into my personal space! When I talk to you about Charlie, you&#39;ve never offered me any word of advice, form of consolation or &#34;help&#34;! Even when you try helping, you make things much worse! When you showed me those photos, it made me feel even worse because... because it just... it reminds me they&#39;re gone!

//Silence for a moment.//

It gave me that reminder that they&#39;re never coming back, that I will never see them again. Whenever I look at the pictures you gave me… it just hurts. It’s tough to think of what could have been, all the possibilities of the future I could have had if they weren’t taken from me so soon. I’m so sorry for lashing out… it’s just… I can’t deal with this pain anymore.

**SCP-6485:** What are you saying?

**Ms. Upston:** It’s okay. We can stop here, alright? Just let me go… I have no one to live for anyways. I just want to see them again.

**SCP-6485:** No! I can’t let you do that! We&#39;ve made some progress already, you can&#39;t just give up now!

//Ms. Upston ignores SCP-6485, lies back down and throws the blanket over herself.//

**Ms. Upston:** Please, just leave me alone, okay?

//The door to Ms. Upston&#39;s room opens and SCP-6485 walks in. She can be seen sleeping on the bed as it walks towards her bed with its whiteboard. It climbs up her bed and shakes her awake.//

**Ms. Upston:** //&lt;mumbling&gt;// Was this how Charlie felt last time... //&lt;groggily&gt;// What do you want?

**SCP-6485:** Someone has requested me to let her see you. She&#39;s waiting outside right now, would you like her to enter?

//Ms. Upston stares suspiciously at SCP-6485, causing it to quickly write something else.//

**SCP-6485:** She&#39;s a friend of Charlie&#39;s who wants to speak with you.

//Ms. Upston&#39;s expression softens and she nods hesitantly. SCP-6485 quickly jumps off the bed and leaves her room. A moment passes and SCP-6485 walks back in again alongside Junior Researcher Lilith Agnes. Dr. Agnes walks towards Ms. Upston as SCP-6485 pulls a chair over to her bed.//

**Dr. Agnes:** Um...

//SCP-6485 nudges her, prompting her to continue.//

**Dr. Agnes:** Ummm... hi, Ms. Upston. I&#39;m... I&#39;m Agnes, one of Charlie&#39;s friends and colleagues. I wanted to meet you today-

**Ms. Upston:** How did you two meet?

**Dr. Agnes:** //&lt;confused&gt;// Huh?

**Ms. Upston:** How... how did you and Charlie meet?

**Dr. Agnes:** Oh… //&lt;Dr. Agnes sits down.&gt;// Well… we were grouped together for orientation, and… while he was really nice, I didn’t want to get too close to him because I thought we’d never see each other again. But… we just kept getting paired together for projects and slowly… we got to know more about each other and become friends. I… I think that us having similar jobs also helped us get grouped together more often.

**Ms. Upston:** Well, what were some of the work he did? I think I remember he said something about him being a psychiatrist, but when I asked him to elaborate, he just… I think he said he couldn’t say too much. It kind of surprised me because he studied… biology? If I remember correctly… but he ended up working as something completely different, so could you tell me more about it?

**Dr. Agnes:** Umm… Alright. Let’s see… If I remember correctly, while he was supposed to be assigned to the biology department after orientation, one of the psychiatrists was reassigned to a different branch just before that and we needed a volunteer to fill in for the time being. Charlie volunteered for it, and after his first session, his performance was impressive enough that he was recommended to change departments.

He didn’t want to originally, but… I think I told him to just go for it! It took a little more persuasion, but he eventually agreed and it was the right choice because he turned out to be really, really amazing. He was… He was just so compassionate and willing to help out those who asked. He also took the time to learn about each and every one of his clients so he could connect with them better! As our work involves bringing… //Dr. Agnes hesitates.// people of interest… and keeping them here, and due to how often unexpected things happen every day, it puts a great deal of stress on everyone. And… Around the beginning of our internship, this branch was going through some financial issues, which added to that stress as well. Still, he always puts on a smile and encourages all of us, and that positivity also caused a… //Dr. Agnes gestures.// a… gradual uplift in the mood around here, I’d say.

I&#39;ve seen some colleagues who had that… air of sadness or stress being able to relax when they were around Charlie… colleagues who were inspired by his helpfulness and positivity and changed themselves for the better, so when he… //Dr. Agnes pauses.// died… it just came as a huge shock to everyone. I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;ll ever know this, but he has changed so many lives and helped so many people. His care and compassion really shined through and he really gave a lot to us and expected really little in return. That… //&lt;hesitates&gt;// That was probably why I started liking him.

**Ms. Upston:** You liked him?

**Dr. Agnes:** I… I… I crushed hard on Charlie when I first met him. I don&#39;t know what it was about him that made me fall in love with him, but I really, really liked him. I thought that it was infatuation, that after meeting during orientation, I&#39;d get over it and move on, but with how often we met and talked, that was when I realised I actually developed a crush on him. I tried to suppress my feelings as I knew he had a girlfriend, but I decided that I should just tell him.

So, I told him to follow me to my office so I could confess, but… I just thought it would have been better to do that in private instead of doing so in like, the canteen… The sick and selfish part in me thought that this was like some anime, that if I confessed, he would have actually love me back... but that selfishness was what got him killed...//&lt;Dr. Agnes starts crying.&gt;// I loved him, Ms. Upston, I loved him, and now I have to live with the fact that he&#39;s dead because of me! I see him there every night when I close my eyes... His body lying there in that hallway... If I didn&#39;t ask him to come to my office that day, maybe he would have lived! So don&#39;t blame the foundation... blame me!

//Ms. Upston leans in and hugs Dr. Agnes. The two women cry as Ms. Upston attempts to console Dr. Agnes.//

**Dr. Agnes:** //&lt;muffled&gt;// I&#39;m so sorry... I caused him to die...

**Ms. Upston:** Hey, hey... don&#39;t blame yourself. It&#39;s... //&lt;Ms. Upston hesitates and reconsiders.&gt;// It&#39;s nobody&#39;s fault he&#39;s dead, alright?

**Dr. Agnes:** //&lt;crying&gt;// I&#39;ve heard what you said after you heard the news... it&#39;s been eating me up inside when I heard what you said about the foundation. Knowing that I caused all this pain and grief to you and everyone else having to be the ones to take the blame for it. I just couldn’t live with myself knowing he’s dead because of me! If I had just waited… or confessed at literally any other time before that…

//Ms. Upston stays silent for a minute before speaking.//

**Ms. Upston:** My dear husband… Charlie’s dad… he went to a client’s party after he secured a huge business deal with them. It was perfect as well, it granted us enough money for all three of us to live comfortably for the rest of our lives. The thing was, before he accepted the invite to the party, he asked me if I was planning on doing anything that night, and I told him… no.

So, he went off to celebrate and he partied until the very early hours of the morning. The thing was, his client’s house was a bit far from our town… kind of high up in the mountains. While he wasn’t drunk, he must’ve thought that since it was kind of late, there wouldn&#39;t be anyone else on that road and so he went pretty fast. What he didn’t know was that there was a bit of a thunderstorm that happened during the party and his car slipped. It plummeted… it plummeted a few hundred feet off the side of the mountain and crashed… and he died- well, I hope he died instantly.

After that happened, I shared a similar sentiment to you. With all the “what-ifs” and the thoughts of what would have happened if I said something different? He’s a family guy, he always puts us above everyone else, so if I had told him I was planning on making dinner or eating out, he would have agreed to do so as well. So… if I had said something differently back then, he would’ve probably lived. That regret… that guilt of knowing that if I said something else, he wouldn’t be dead, and then I learn that Charlie’s dead as well while I’m still trying to heal from my husband’s death… it just hurts so much.

So please, don&#39;t blame yourself for what I&#39;ve said. It was me lashing out at that time, okay? I wasn&#39;t thinking straight when I said that, okay? I... I just didn&#39;t know how to feel at that time and I chose to blame everyone. I thought that the people here in your branch just didn&#39;t care about Charlie when he died, but now, after hearing it from you, someone who was close to, and a friend of him, hearing how much he has helped out all of you, I realise that I was wrong.

//Ms. Upston looks into Dr. Agnes&#39; eyes.//

It is something I also have to come to terms with as well... that it is no one&#39;s fault for Charlie&#39;s death. I&#39;m so sorry I&#39;ve made you feel this way for so long. Please... don&#39;t worry about how I feel. I forgive you.

//Dr. Agnes bursts into sobs and hugs Ms. Upston again, crying and apologising as Ms. Upston pats her back and whispers words of forgiveness.//

**Ms. Upston:** To... to be honest, I&#39;m still figuring out my feelings on my own and I don&#39;t know how it is going to be from this point forward. //&lt;turns her head towards SCP-6485&gt;// But... I know there&#39;s someone to help and guide me through this process and make it easier to grieve and come to terms with it. But I don&#39;t think that there&#39;ll be people as lucky as me to have some sort of a support group to deal with it. That&#39;s why I want to pay it forward and give you that shoulder to cry on if you need it.

//Dr. Agnes tearfully nods.//

**Ms. Upston:** If I may ask, how was he like?

**Dr. Agnes:** Oh... He was really nice, a real sweetheart. He was such a beacon of positivity, and it was a real refresher for all of us because working here is quite stressful. He goes out of his way to help anyone who has any trouble, and he was very easy to open up to! Like I said, he helped out so many people here, and even though it was his job to do so, I could tell that he truly had care for each and everyone of the people he&#39;s worked with.

He was friends with everyone here, but for me, he was my only friend, which was why I was so close to him. I&#39;m not sure if he did this intentionally or not, but I think he did as he would spend more time with me than his other friends here. Just talking with me after work, eating our meals together or helping me with work when I needed it the most, I think these little interactions were what caused us to grow closer when he was working here.

**SCP-6485:** So, have you thought about what you want to do?

**Ms. Upston:** I... I want to try and move on. I&#39;ve... I&#39;ve thought about it after my meeting with Ms. Agnes, and I feel like I have to do it, right? I have to pull myself together. Not only for my sake, but for Charlie. I don&#39;t think he would like to see what I have become.

**SCP-6485:** I see, but don&#39;t feel pressured to move on just because you think someone else wants you to. If you don&#39;t feel ready to move on just yet, I&#39;ll wait for you. But, to be sure, are you ready to start?

**Ms. Upston:** //&lt;silence&gt;// No. After what you’ve said, I don’t think… I don’t think that I spent enough time grieving and I feel that if I move on too quickly, that feeling may still linger within me and engulf me when I’m not expecting it. I… I also am not ready to move on from someone who I’ve raised for 19, 20 years of my life in just like, 2, 3 months?

**SCP-6485:** I see. I understand if you don’t want to move on so quickly, as I said, it’s fine. We can take it one day at a time. But, what is grief, if not love persevering? At the end of the day, the reason why you&#39;re grieving is because of the love you have for Charlie. It reminds you that you&#39;ve loved, and will always continue to love him. It’s easy to feel astray after you’ve lost someone so close to you, especially since you’ve already lost your husband recently. But, I’m here to help point you in the right direction and guide you on the road to recovery.

**Ms. Upston:** I see... I guess there&#39;s a part of me that does want to try and move on, but I don&#39;t want to just ignore and tune out the negative feelings inside of me. It&#39;s just... I don&#39;t know, regret&#39;s been eating me up inside, and the more I think about it, the worse I feel.

**SCP-6485:** What do you mean?

**Ms. Upston:** I really, really regret not spending enough time with Charlie. It’s something I felt after his father’s death, but I still thought that we would have more time. I shouldn’t have shunned him for so long… I know he was also really affected by the suddenness of what happened and I should have helped and supported him through it. I wish that I could have brought him out for dinner, just sit down and have a nice talk with him; or go out with him, either to a place we used to go to with his father or somewhere new... but- //Ms. Upston&#39;s voice cracks.// I can&#39;t anymore.

It&#39;s hard to swallow the fact that I&#39;ll never be able to spend another birthday with him, another Christmas or another New Years, that I&#39;ll never be able to see him get married or start a family. But... I don&#39;t want to dwell on what could have been, and instead focus on what he has done already. I just hope that wherever he is, his father will be there to accompany him, and... when my time comes, I&#39;ll be able to see them again.

//Ms. Upston pauses.//

I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m being too negative... but I miss them a lot. I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about them after I saw that photo, and that just reminded me of how... //Ms. Upston hesitates.// how the people I&#39;ve loved are gone now.

**SCP-6485:** It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m here for you and I promise that I&#39;ll continue to be here for you, every step of the way.

//SCP-6485 sets down its whiteboard and sits next to Ms. Upston as she cries.//

[BEGIN LOG]

**Ms. Upston:** Can I ask a question?

**Dr. Jonas:** Go ahead.

**Ms. Upston:** Have you met my son? What was he like?

**Dr. Jonas:** Oh, Charlie? Hmm, I&#39;m sorry to say, but I only met him a couple of times when he was working here. However, even with minimal interactions, I could tell that he was a very friendly and optimistic person, even in this line of work. I’ve heard a lot of good things coworkers of his about how he was super friendly and helpful to… others here, how he was very easy to open up to and how he was really ambitious and bright.

**Ms. Upston:** Oh... Thank you. That&#39;s... that’s really nice to hear. I’m... I’m quite relieved that he was still a nice gentleman when he was working here and it seems to be a common impression that everybody shares. It gives me some assurance that I- no, we raised him well. &lt;silence&gt; I... I wanted to ask this as well but kept forgetting. What happened to his body?

**Dr. Jonas:** We held a private funeral for him. It’s... something that our branch does for colleagues who have passed on to help honour their memory and remember their contributions. We usually send their bodies back to their families afterwards for them to arrange their funerals the way they see fit, but during our initial visit to your house, because of your teddy bear and how you reacted in the initial interview, we didn’t want to burden you with the weight and emotion of arranging that for him.

**Ms. Upston:** So, where is his body now? What did you do to it?

**Dr. Jonas:** We ended up deciding that a burial would be more appropriate. He’s currently buried in your hometown’s cemetery. Southvale Cemetery, is that correct?

**Ms. Upston:** Yes. //&lt;silence&gt;// Thank you. Thank you for… for really taking into consideration my mental state when deciding on what to do. I’m really sorry I’ve inconvenienced you like this.

**Dr. Jonas:** No worries. It&#39;s the least we can do for a bright mind who left us too early.

**Ms. Upston:** So... What about his belongings? What happened to them?

**Dr. Jonas:** They&#39;re currently in storage, but if you&#39;d like, we can give them back to you tomorrow.

**Ms. Upston:** Yes, please. I think that it might help me find some closure by looking through his things.

**SCP-6485:** What would you like to go through today?

**Ms. Upston:** A coworker of Charlie’s gave me some boxes of his personal belongings so I picked one and was thinking that we could go through this today. I didn’t really help much when he was packing to stay here, so I thought it would be interesting to see what he brought.

**SCP-6485:** Alright!

//SCP-6485 climbs into the box and takes out several photo frames. It seemingly hesitates before passing them to Ms. Upston. She looks through the pictures and smiles.//

**Ms. Upston:** That’s where the graduation photo went! I know you can make one, but it’s kinda surreal looking at the original photograph! Oh… and this is a picture of him and Asuka at Disney! //She turns to look at SCP-6485.// He’s quite a sentimental boy, something his father taught him since young. Ever since we lost our photos to that house fire… he’s gotten into taking polaroids and keeping small tokens as memories. I’m glad to see he managed to bring a couple here.

//Ms. Upston looks at a picture of Researcher Charlie taken during orientation and smiles.//

Wow… he looks so smart! He… he kinda looks like his dad here. Was this really six months ago?

//Ms. Upston sets the picture frame down onto the bed and SCP-6485 takes a small wooden horse out. It passes it to her and she looks at it in wonder.//

**SCP-6485:** What’s that?

**Ms. Upston:** Oh my god, I didn’t know he still had this! //She turns to look at SCP-6485.// This was a horse that his dad sculpted for him as part of a zoo toy set for his sixth birthday. He liked this one the most… his dad always told him that horses represented resilience and strength, and it became some sort of a charm that he would carry about. I thought he threw it out when he moved in with his girlfriend, but I guess not. Are there any other animals from the set here?

//Ms. Upston looks through the box as SCP-6485 takes several polaroid pictures out and passes them to her.//

Oh! Speaking of polaroids… //&lt;silence as Ms. Upston reads the captions&gt;// These must be his friends here! “Orientation 2020”... Oh, there’s Mr. Jonas! And that is Ms. Agnes! //Ms. Upston sifts through the other pictures.// Yeah, she appears the most in all these photos. It seems like this is a weekly thing…

//Ms. Upston digs through the box and takes out every polaroid she can see. She then sorts through them until she finds the most recent picture. She looks at it and smiles sadly.//

So this was how Charlie looked like before he passed. “One last picture before Thanksgiving”... He looked so happy with his friends.

//She gathers and quickly organises the photos before gently moving them to the side. She then takes a journal out and flips it open to a random page.//

**SCP-6485:** What does it say?

**Ms. Upston:** Let’s see… There are quite a few sketches of circles and ‘to-do’ lists here. //Ms. Upston flips through the pages until she finds an entry.// Ah! Alright… “It finally arrived! I’m not sure how it managed to make it past Foundation checks, but that’s fine as it arrived in one piece! It cost me quite a bit of money to get this made, but thankfully working here pays well. I hope Asuka enjoys this gift as much as I enjoyed making it - I can’t wait to see her reaction to this when I go back for Thanksgiving! I can’t wait to surprise my mum with the news as well! I don’t really write my feelings down like this, but I’m just so excited and I can’t share this with anyone else because I want this to be a surprise!”

**SCP-6485:** Any clue as to what that item might be?

**Ms. Upston:** //&lt;flipping through the journal&gt;// Nope, this seems to be more about his work than his personal life. //She passes the journal to SCP-6485.// Maybe you’d know.

**SCP-6485:** Nope, not a clue. Is there anything else?

//Ms. Upston looks back into the box.//

**Ms. Upston:** No, I don’t think so. The rest of the items here look like stuff from when he was working here so I don’t think I am well-versed enough to touch them. I’ll probably ask Dr. Jonas for a little more context if I see him again.

**SCP-6485:** Alright. How was it? Looking through Charlie’s old stuff?

**Ms. Upston:** Oh, it was quite nice. I mean, I managed to find things that I thought were long gone, and it kind of helped me revisit the memories associated with some of his belongings here. I also learnt more about Charlie while he was working here, and I’m happy he hasn’t changed from his usual happy self.

**SCP-6485:** That’s really great to hear.

//[The next thirty-five minutes of conversation have been declared irrelevant. To see the extended transcript, submit a request to Site Director Light.]//

**Ms. Upston:** I’ll probably get to the rest of the other boxes at a later date. I don’t know if it’s good to go through all of it at once today.

**SCP-6485:** Alright, don’t hesitate to tell me so we can do it together.

//Ms. Upston nods as she begins packing away the items. Just as she places the journal into the box, SCP-6485 stops her.//

**SCP-6485:** What’s that?

**Ms. Upston:** Huh?

//SCP-6485 points at a small red box at the bottom of the box of belongings. Ms. Upston picks it up and opens it to reveal a ring. She gasps and starts crying as she drops the ring box, causing SCP-6485 to jump and catch it. SCP-6485 opens the ring box and takes the ring out as Ms. Upston continues crying with a smile on her face.//

[BEGIN LOG]

**Dr. Jonas:** Before we release you tomorrow, I need to give some important reminders. Firstly, I must instruct that you keep your experiences here over the last two months a secret. Our organisation is doing its best to maintain its veil of secrecy from the general public, so I can&#39;t stress enough how important it is that you not share these encounters with them.

**Ms. Upston:** I understand.

**Dr. Jonas:** This also goes for the teddy bear. I must ask that you hide it away from the public and inform us if you are taking it outside. If anybody sees it moving, appearing or disappearing, inform us immediately.

//Ms. Upston nods.//

Secondly, you are to submit weekly reports of the teddy bear to me. Just tell me if there have been any behavioural changes you observed as well as a summary of what you two did together, like places you visited, what activities you did together, et cetera. Do you understand?

**Ms. Upston:** Yes. How long do I have to do this for?

**Dr. Jonas:** I ask that you do this for about three months so we can see how it goes.

**Ms. Upston:** Okay.

**Dr. Jonas:** Thirdly, several members of our organisation will also be moving in to the neighbourhood around a month from now and they’ll be watching over you in case anything goes wrong. If you have any questions or anything else to report that I didn’t mention, you can always contact one of them after you’re discharged.

**Ms. Upston:** Alright.

Good afternoon Mr. Jonas,

When we got home, I realised that the teddy bear had stopped teleporting to my immediate location when I leave it on its own. I did a little test of my own where I placed the bear inside my bedroom and left the house, and it didn&#39;t follow me. Like what you emphasised about keeping everything I&#39;ve experienced a secret, I bought some curtains immediately after so it wouldn&#39;t be caught moving around.

It seems that while it does still help out with the chores and continues to try to help me, its&#39; help is slowly decreasing as I slowly get back on my own two feet. It still provides me company when I&#39;m eating and when I&#39;m sleeping, though.

However, something major also happened this morning. When I went to the supermarket to buy some food for myself, I just started to cry. I&#39;m not sure whether it is me realising I&#39;d never be able to cook for him anymore or what, but when I did so, the teddy bear immediately appeared in front of me and began to comfort me. I&#39;m sure there were a few witnesses following its appearance, so I rushed home as quick as I could to send this to you. Sorry in advance for any inconvenience caused.

Sincerely,
Lily Upston

Good evening Mr. Jonas,

I recently met up with his girlfriend and best friend following some advice from the teddy bear. We talked about Charlie and what he meant to us and I gave the ring Charlie got to his girlfriend. That was also when I learnt they had similar teddy bears who had informed them about, and were also helping them cope with his death.

There aren&#39;t any major changes in its behaviour since my last report. It still provides company and is constantly checking up on me. It also comforted me after I cried again following my visits to his girlfriend&#39;s and best friend&#39;s.

Sincerely,
Lily Upston

**Notes:** Following this weekly report and further information provided by Ms. Upston, tracker chips and instructions have been mailed out to them.

Good evening Mr. Jonas,

I finally decided to go through some of the other boxes of Charlie’s stuff with the teddy bear. There weren’t a lot of his personal belongings in them, just his clothes and books he brought for his stay at your site. One of the boxes also contained a few more work journals which were filled with notes on his clients which I looked through for some light reading. While I can’t really say I understand much of what is in it, I could see that he was very dedicated to his research and detail-orientated to help out his clients. I also read some letters left for him by his colleagues, and it was quite bittersweet seeing how much he’s affected them and how he could have done more.

It has also been doing its&#39; hardest to help me fall back to my regular routine after my discharge, and while it is difficult to do so this quickly, I&#39;ve been trying my best to follow its&#39; advice and slowly readjust my life.

There aren&#39;t any major changes in its behaviour that I&#39;ve observed since I sent my last report.

Sincerely,
Lily Upston

Good evening Mr. Jonas,

I finally visited Charlie&#39;s grave today. It was fairly quiet at the cemetery, with only the teddy bear accompanying me. It was nice to see his grave covered in flowers and cards, that gives me some assurance that he had met a lot of wonderful people when he was still alive.

The hole in my heart left by Charlie is still there, and while it can heal over time, it will never go back to how it was originally. The emptiness will still be there.

I really miss him.

There is nothing about the teddy bear&#39;s behaviour that has changed since last week, but I  realised we have grown a lot closer following my release.

I&#39;ve also decided to name the teddy bear after him.

Sincerely,
Lily Upston
