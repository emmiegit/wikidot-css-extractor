**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-6840 is to be stored in a standard containment chamber at Site-██. The chamber should be equipped with a lockable door and monitored by surveillance cameras. Only Level 2 personnel and above are allowed access to SCP-6840 without written permission from a Level 3 or higher authority.

To prevent unauthorized use, the key to SCP-6840&#39;s chamber should be kept in a secure location separate from the containment chamber itself. The key should be accessed only by authorized personnel when granting permission for research or therapy sessions.

Access to SCP-6840-1 requires written permission from at least one Level 3 personnel, who must be present during the entry and exit procedures. Researchers or personnel entering SCP-6840-1 must be equipped with a standard audio-visual recording device to document their experiences.

It is recommended that individuals who wish to enter SCP-6840-1 for therapeutic purposes submit a formal request to the designated ethics committee, outlining their reasons and providing relevant medical or psychological evaluations. Sessions within SCP-6840-1 should be limited to a maximum of two hours per day to prevent excessive detachment from reality.

Regular psychological evaluations should be conducted on individuals who have used SCP-6840-1 for extended periods to monitor their mental well-being and ensure they maintain a balanced connection with the outside world. If any adverse effects or signs of addiction are observed, access to SCP-6840-1 should be immediately suspended until further evaluation and counseling can be provided.

In the event of any anomalous or unexpected changes within SCP-6840 or SCP-6840-1, such as alterations to the environment or reports of distressing experiences, the containment chamber should be sealed, and the anomaly reported to Site administration for further investigation and appropriate actions.

Overall, containment procedures for SCP-6840 are primarily focused on maintaining controlled access to SCP-6840-1 and ensuring the well-being of individuals using the anomaly for therapeutic purposes while preventing any potential misuse or overreliance on its effects.

**Description:**

SCP-6840 is a wooden wardrobe measuring 2 meters in height, 1 meter in width, and 1 meter in depth. It appears to be a vintage piece of furniture with intricate carvings on its surface, often associated with the words &#34;tranquility&#34; and &#34;wardrobe&#34;. Despite its age of estimated 40 years, SCP-6840 is in remarkably good condition, displaying no signs of wear or decay.

When any individual opens SCP-6840&#39;s doors and steps inside, they enter a pocket dimension designated as SCP-6840-1. SCP-6840-1 is a serene and idyllic meadow, with a clear blue sky, gentle rolling hills, and various flora in full bloom. The weather remains pleasant at all times, and the sounds of birds chirping and a gentle breeze can be heard. Time within SCP-6840-1 progresses at a rate significantly slower than the outside world, allowing individuals to spend extended periods of time inside without experiencing significant temporal displacement upon exiting.

The interior of SCP-6840 consists of a small pathway leading to a single, comfortable wooden bench situated under a large, ancient tree. The tree provides ample shade, and its leaves emit a calming scent known to induce a state of tranquility and relaxation. Individuals who sit on the bench within SCP-6840-1 report feelings of deep peace and contentment, with a notable reduction in stress and anxiety. Extended stays within SCP-6840-1 have been observed to have positive therapeutic effects on individuals suffering from various mental health conditions.

SCP-6840 has been tested extensively and has shown no signs of being capable of causing harm or displaying any anomalous properties beyond its ability to access SCP-6840-1. However, it should be noted that SCP-6840 must be monitored to prevent any unauthorized or excessive use, as prolonged absences from reality may result in neglect of personal responsibilities and detachment from the outside world.

**Addendum 6840-1:**

Following Incident 6840-A, access to SCP-6840 and SCP-6840-1 is temporarily suspended pending further investigation.

On ██/██/20██, Researcher ████ conducted an unauthorized experiment involving an extended stay within SCP-6840-1. Researcher ████ remained inside SCP-6840-1 for a period of 72 hours, significantly surpassing the recommended time limit. Upon exiting SCP-6840-1, Researcher ████ displayed signs of severe disorientation and distress.

Interview logs revealed that Researcher ████ experienced a phenomenon referred to as &#34;Temporal Desynchronization,&#34; where the perception of time within SCP-6840-1 had become drastically distorted. Researcher ████ reported spending what felt like weeks or months inside SCP-6840-1, while only a few days had passed in the outside world.

Further psychological evaluation revealed that Researcher ████ developed a sense of detachment from reality and exhibited difficulty distinguishing between SCP-6840-1 and the real world. Symptoms consistent with depersonalization disorder and derealization were also noted. Researcher ████ was subsequently placed under psychiatric care and prohibited from further involvement with SCP-6840.

As a result of Incident 6840-A, the following additional containment procedures are implemented:

All personnel with access to SCP-6840 must undergo mandatory training on the potential risks of extended exposure to SCP-6840-1, emphasizing adherence to the recommended time limits.

Access to SCP-6840-1 must be limited to a maximum of two hours per day for all personnel, regardless of their psychological evaluation.

Any signs of prolonged or excessive use of SCP-6840-1 should be reported to the site&#39;s medical and psychological departments for immediate evaluation and counseling.

Research on the temporal anomalies and psychological effects associated with SCP-6840-1 is to be conducted under controlled conditions and with appropriate oversight from Level 3 personnel.

Research regarding the temporal anomalies and potential long-term effects caused by SCP-6840-1 is ongoing. Efforts are being made to further understand and mitigate the risks associated with prolonged exposure to SCP-6840-1. Updates to containment procedures will be implemented accordingly based on research findings and risk assessments.
