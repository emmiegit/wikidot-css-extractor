Howdy!

I&#39;m [[*user Impperatrix]] but you can call me Impp or Pietro. I&#39;m not the most prolific or skilled artist, but I sure have some things to show, even if they are not as wonderful as I wanted them to be. I was really thinking if I should create that and the idea that I could reunite some feedback on my things by doing this convinced me to finally do this.

Most of my work is digital art as I don&#39;t have anything SCP-related made on paper yet. It will probably change as I return to drawing and creating things!

++ My stuff

[[tab Art for my things]]


+++ SCP-5452 Characters
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ L is for Levin&#34; hide=&#34;-&#34;]]

[[image l.png]]
Levin is based on the Tsundere boys that I loved as a teenager and that I really feel like they are just toxic right now. His main inspiration is My Candy Love&#39;s Castiel.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ O is for Orion&#34; hide=&#34;-&#34;]]

[[image o.png]]
Orion is this Kuudere prideful boy. He is mostly based on a previous version of himself made by [[*user Dr Whitney]] that was to be used on the actual skip but was changed due to some changes in the narrative. I hate his hair and he will be the first that I&#39;ll remake when I return to this SCP.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ V is for Vivi&#34; hide=&#34;-&#34;]]

[[image v.png]]
I wanted a catgirl. Why? I don&#39;t know.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ E is for Eve&#34; hide=&#34;-&#34;]]

[[image e.png]]
Eve was the first character that I made for the skip and was to be the protagonist. Before the last version, she was the one that should go crazy.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ R is for Ramiel&#34; hide=&#34;-&#34;]]

[[image r.png]]
The angel, the God, the demon. R is my favorite character and the one that I like the design the most, even if I think I should improve some things on them anyway. They are a psycho and godlike version of characters like Regina George and Heather Chandler, but with a bit of Monika and White Diamond.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ D is for Diderot/Daniel&#34; hide=&#34;-&#34;]]

[[image d.png]]
[[image d2.png]]
Well, that&#39;s a spoiler, but... yeah, Diderot and Daniel are supposed to be the same character. Diderot is highly inspired by Glacon and Daniel is literally a cute recolor of Ramiel.

[[tab Logos]]

+++ Task Forces
[[collapsible show=&#34;MTF Beta-777 (Hecate&#39;s Spear)&#34; hide=&#34;-&#34;]]
[[image Beta777.png]]
I&#39;m a fan of [[*user Grigori Karpin]]&#39;s [[[Hecatoncheires Cycle Hub]]] stories. I was planning to add Beta-777 to a tale, so I&#39;ve created this and sent it to Grigori to see his opinion. Even if the draft was scrapped, the Logo is being used at the Hub and I can&#39;t be happier!
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;MTF Epsilon-8 (The Midwives)&#34; hide=&#34;-&#34;]]
[[image Epsilon8.png]]
I really think this MTF is really underused. I was thinking about using them too, so I made this logo for them. I think is very fitting.
[[/collapsible]]


[[collapsible show=&#34;MTF Pi-15 (Supernannies)&#34; hide=&#34;-&#34;]]
[[image Pi15.png]]
This was part of an idea that I was planning to do. Right now it is in a strange limbo but I&#39;ll manage to do this anyway. It&#39;s an MTF related to a GoI that involves a child orphanage/school for anomalous children. 
[[/collapsible]]
+++ Canons

[[collapsible show=&#34;Daybreak&#34; hide=&#34;-&#34;]]
[[image CotBS.png]]
I was very excited when [[*user S D Locke]] made the [[[Daybreak]]] Hub, so I made it. It&#39;s a cute and simple logo for my favorite 001 proposal.
[[/collapsible]]
[[/tab]]

[[tab Fan Art, I guess?]]

+++ Miscellaneous

[[collapsible show=&#34;Scarlet Baby&#34; hide=&#34;-&#34;]]
[[image babyscarlet.png]]
[[image babyscarlet2.png]]

A concept inspired by a video by Cimmerian about SCP-999 and the discussion about that video on the channel&#39;s Discord server. It&#39;s my headcanon on how Scarlet King would look like as a baby, a Lovecraftian scarlet blob baby!
