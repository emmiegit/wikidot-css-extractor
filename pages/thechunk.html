Waiting for the 8k Con announcement last night was truly a magical experience. I could barely sleep, and not just because I drank three cups of coffee right before bed. It was like New Year’s and Christmas and the first day of school all rolled into one. 

I&#39;m glad I&#39;ve gotten involved with the site again recently, especially on the site Discord. I know my voice is just one of thousands, but it still feels good sometimes just to be there, and to participate in the experience of something that&#39;s bigger than you in whatever way you can. 

I don&#39;t realistically think I&#39;m in a position to do well going up against the best active writers on the site. My articles usually don&#39;t even do that well when going up against no one. But it&#39;s hard to see a reason not to join: if I write a decent article, I&#39;d rather post it when site activity is high and people are excited to read it. If I write an underwhelming article, it&#39;s going to be underwhelming no matter when I post it.

I&#39;m hoping to be active (as much as my IRL schedule allows) not just as a writer, but in the broader community, at least where I can. I always try to be active in the crit forums, and to give back more feedback than I get, so hopefully this is a chance for me to contribute something of substance, even if it&#39;s not just through my own writing.

The road ahead somehow seems daunting yet incredibly short. There&#39;s too long to wait but not enough time. If there&#39;s nothing more I can do now, I wish luck in this contest to the Universe. Maybe in the end the Universe will even have a place for little old me.

I&#39;ve decided to retool the draft I&#39;ve been working on to fit the contest. For a second this felt like cheating until I realized that this would help me find a more concrete direction for it, and actually help pull together the whole thing. So joining 8k con was already a good idea: even if I come in dead last

Being between drafts is tough. You can&#39;t write anything good unless you believe sincerely that it&#39;s the best thing you&#39;ve ever written, but you can&#39;t improve on it unless you believe sincerely that it&#39;s borderline unreadable. I&#39;m waiting for some folks to get back to me with their critiques of my draft, but that&#39;s a good thing: the more time I have to put some distance between myself and the draft, the more equipped I&#39;ll be to make use of their feedback. My biggest worry is that I don&#39;t start developing my next draft in my head to the point where I feel guilty for asking people to read my first attempt.

++++ Pt. 2

At best this site makes me feel like I get to be a part of something bigger than myself. At worst, it makes me feel impossibly small.

I joined this site because I like the articles, I enjoy the worldbuilding, and I care about the writing. Now I&#39;m surrounded by people whom I know by their work. Work that I don&#39;t just know, but that I care about deeply. And those are people who, by my work or by my name, don&#39;t know me from Adam. It would be nice to believe we&#39;re peers, but that idea seems more and more like a gentle fiction, held up for the sake of those who need it most.

I’d like to believe all the things I tell myself: That every attempt, no matter how unsuccessful, is another opportunity to improve. That you learn more from defeat than you do from victory. That nobody starts out where they eventually end up. 

But the thing that echoes louder than any of those platitudes is the thing I don&#39;t have to tell myself at all, because I already know it: there&#39;s good and there&#39;s not good. And if you&#39;re not good, you&#39;re not good.

I woke up early today, but not as early as I’d have liked. 8 AM is early compared only to what time I woke up yesterday, not compared to the rest of the world. 

I haven&#39;t gone to the gym as much as I should have this past week. Starting tomorrow, I need to adjust my priorities.

If you&#39;d asked me at any of a hundred different points in my life whether I’d rather write or go to the gym, I would say write a hundred times. I think I&#39;ve finally changed my mind. 

The thing about going to the gym is that it’s a story that begins and ends with you. Your success at the gym depends solely on what you choose to put into it, and what you choose to get out of it, not on other people. Other people are at worst an afterthought, and at best, not even there. 

Writing only ever lives in the minds of other people. This isn&#39;t a problem; it&#39;s the point: no one publishes their work unless they want to be seen. But as a result, nothing you write, once published, is ever really yours. A writer can build the body, but it&#39;s the reader who gives it life. 

I&#39;ve always felt most motivated to write when I&#39;ve felt like I don&#39;t know how to connect with people more directly. I worry that in the long run I&#39;m just giving a new shape to the same problem. 

Today I woke up at 8 AM. Tomorrow I will wake up at 7.

Getting back to the gym has reminded me of something important: that downtime is as important as active time. 

I&#39;ve felt this week that I need to be rushing towards something. Rushing towards the next draft, rushing towards the next critique, rushing towards any tangible sign of improvement. But now what I think I need to do is wait. Take my time, let my ideas ferment, and let them out when they&#39;re ready. 

I&#39;ve gotten some great feedback and I see a million ways to improve my draft, but I need to be ready to start fresh with my second draft i stead of trying to constantly tweak and tinker with every little thing as I go. I&#39;ll try to take the weekend to reflect and start over on Monday with a clean outlook. At least, I&#39;ll see how close to Monday I can get without cracking.
