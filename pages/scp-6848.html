**Special Containment Procedures:** At least one MTF-Theta 15 member (“The Fishlickers”) must constantly monitor all cats that have been recorded to fall subject to an SCP-6848 event in the past.If they are seen to enter SCP-6848-A, the date and timeframe of the event must be recorded and the records must be locked in secure Foundation servers.
If the cats display any anomalies in their behaviour or physical appearance during or after an SCP-6848 event, a report must be given to Director Jones Fisher, Project Lead of SCP-6848.

All Rosen-Fortune bridges created by an SCP-6848 should be preserved intact at the site of formation, and no personnel are to enter a range of less than 3m near the formation site of the Rosen-Fortune bridge.

**Description:** SCP-6848 is an anomalous event during which members of the species //felis catus//, commonly familiar as the domestic cat, start running at full speed, and hereby completely disappear and reappear after a short amount of time,usually in a secure spot.This event is usually preceded by contact with water, dogs, or loud noises. In certain occasions, such events occur for no known reason. The implication hypothesised hereby by said events is that cats are also able to willingly trigger such an event whenever they desire.
During an SCP-6848 event, a Rosen-Fortune Bridge [[footnote]] Colloquially known as a “Way”.[[/footnote]] will momentarily open at the site of entrance, causing a  spatial anomaly of no immediate dangers to the vicinity to appear at the site. This spatial anomaly ceases the moment the subject that has undergone an SCP-6848 event exits SCP-6848-A.
People who have witnessed a cat enter the Rosen-Fortune bridge appear to have no memory of the event afterwards, and only have the impression that “the cat just disappeared”.
The current speculation is that a component of SCP-6848, either the cat or the Rosen-Fortune Bridge, exude a substance similar to amnestics which affects all human beings in the proximity of 50 meters from the cat at the time of entrance. Tests using mnestics have so far yielded no results in recovering the possibly lost, or “locked” memories of witnesses.
------

SCP-6848-A is an alternate dimension that&#39;s out of sight of all humans and is contiguous with all of spacetime. Cats may travel through it at will, allowing them to go from one point to another seemingly instantly. Certain other animals can also enter it, though such occurrences are rarer.This dimension is known as “the cat dimension”, or alternatively, [[[Nine Tales from the Cativerse|”the Cativerse”.]]]
It is suspected all cats have entered the cat dimension during their lifetime.

------
The topology of SCP-6848-A appears to vary in different locations within the dimension, but it is consistent that SCP-6848-A follows an infinitely repeating design.
SCP-6848-A is also noted to possess something akin to a “dimensional layering”, akin to the dimensional structure of baseline reality. While no extradimensional structures of higher “layers” of SCP-6848-A have been recorded yet, their existence is assumed due to the spontaneous appearance and disappearance of objects possessing spatial dimensions much more than 3, reaching up to [[[SCP-3125|5]]] spatial dimensions.

SCP-6848-A is suspected to be a “mirror dimension” to baseline reality, and therefore contains all of the elements, entities and cosmological structures of baseline reality, though altered to fit the feline environment within the dimension. Therefore,it is assumed all of the PoIs, SoIs, and GoIs of baseline reality exist in SCP-6848-A in some other shape and form, with their practices and behaviour being altered to match those that would be regular to a cat, though still affected by the main narrative vortexes [[footnote]] A “bubble” which pataphysically encapsulates all entities in existence and determines their role and preferred actions in the narrative they are located within. [[/footnote]] of the PoIs, SoIs, and GoIs of baseline reality.

**Addendum 6848.1:** Initial Contact Recon Log

//Note: The following is the transcript of audio logs taken during the first recon operation to SCP-6848-A.[[footnote]] The recon operations at SCP-6848-A were made possible via the manual creation of a Rosen-Fortune bridge between baseline reality and SCP-6848-A. [[/footnote]]Up until this point, no human or humanoid entity had ever successfully seen or interacted with entities from SCP-6848-A, other than domesticated cats.//
//Recon team was composed of three members of MTF Theta-15 “Fishlickers”,lead by MTF T-15 Charlie. Recon site was a location where a Kardashev Type II civilisation was noted to have been formed by a group of felinoid entities resembling members of the species Felis sylvestris libica, commonly known as wildcats, though of much larger size than what would be expected.//

&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; **Charlie:** Alright command. We’re situated in position A,and we’re ready to roll.
&gt; 
&gt; **Command:** Confirmed. Go ahead and sound off.
&gt; 
&gt; **Alpha:** Theta-15 Alpha, check.
&gt; 
&gt; **Bravo:** Theta-15 Bravo, check.
&gt; 
&gt; **Charlie:** Theta-15 Charlie,check.
&gt;
&gt; **Command:** Alright, men. You’re situated in a location about 60m from what seems to be a group of wildcats. Be on standby.
&gt;
&gt; **Charlie:** Alright.Awaiting orders.
&gt;
&gt; **Command:** Slowly approach the creatures while utilising your [[[SCP-055|stealth equipment.]]] Do not stray too far from your positions and/or routes.Report any unusual behaviour expressed from the felinoid entities.
&gt;
&gt; **Charlie:** Alright, command. Alpha, Bravo, let’s roll.
&gt;
&gt; **Alpha:** There seems to be another cat at the hill they’re headed at. It’s shorter than the others, grey fur at its head, legs and paws, though its body is…rainbow?
&gt;
&gt; **Charlie:** Alpha, we’re seeing it too. The area around it appears to possess an unusually high HUME count. Command, do you hear?
&gt;
&gt; **Command:** We hear you. Try not to approach the recorded cat. It’s possible it could possess reality bending powers. Move closer to the wildcats. If they attempt to reach for it, follow route C-2. When you’re in enough range for the HUME detector to measure the exact amount, report the number back to us.
&gt;
&gt; **Charlie:** Got it.Over.
&gt;
&gt; **Bravo:** A feline entity appeared by the side of the feline entity with rainbow fur. Wait. Is that [[[SCP-529|Josie?]]]
&gt;
&gt; **Charlie:** Bravo,let me get this correctly. You’re seeing SCP-529 at the site? Well,it is a feline entity,sure,but…why would she-?
&gt; //A high pitching noise can be heard from Charlie ‘s transmitters.//
&gt;
&gt; **Command:** Charlie,are you alright? Charlie? Charlie? Charlie,report if you’re not experiencing any problems.
&gt;
&gt; **Alpha:** Fuck,what’s going on with ‘em?
&gt;
&gt; **Bravo:** What in God ‘s name is that thing?
&gt;
&gt; **Command:** Alpha,Bravo. Report what you’re seeing. Charlie seems to be unresponsive,so Alpha has the mission lead from now on. If Charlie is incapacitated,do not approach their bodies.
&gt;
&gt; **Alpha:** Okay,got it. We’re seeing something shaped like a giant spear, rainbow in colour. It’s glowing with high luminosity. The light is almost dazzling. It’s situated 20 meters above Charlie ‘s position and floating. It appears to have completely incapacitated Charlie. Wait, the cat at the hill has moved higher up the hill now. It seems to be controlling the spear,in some way? This thing is //definitely// a reality bender. The HUME count is absurd.
&gt;
&gt; **Command:** What’s the estimated class? Nevermind,it doesn’t matter. Clock up the efficiency output of the stealth equipment and head to the exit Way. Report if you’re interrupted by any entities.
&gt;
&gt; **Alpha:** Got it. Coming. Bravo,behind me. We’re following exit route.
&gt;
&gt; **Alpha:** Bravo?
&gt;
&gt;**Alpha:** Bravo…?
&gt;
&gt; **Command:** Alpha,is Bravo alright? Are they incapacitated by the spear too? Alpha..?
&gt;
&gt; **Alpha:** …
//Audible sounds of stabbing can be heard from Alpha ‘s transmitter.//
&gt;
&gt; //After around 3 hours of being unresponsive,team T-15 C responds.//
&gt;
&gt; **Charlie:** Command, we were out for…how long? Whatever. Now we’re in some kind of room, oh shit, they’re coming.
&gt;
&gt; **Command:** Try to be peaceful and do not engage the creatures. If any of them can speak in human language, try and interact with it. We’re opening video log, so you don’t have to relay everything back to us.
&gt;
&gt; **Charlie:** Alright command. Got it.
&gt;
&gt; //The cat described by C previously enters the room, accompanied by SCP-529. A rainbow shining crown appears to be on its head, and the spear described by A and B previously is also accompanying him, levitating 3 meters off the ground.//
&gt; **Charlie:** Wha- what the fuck? Why’d you lock us in here?
&gt;
&gt; **Cat:** Hello,humans. I see you’ve arrived all safe and sound. Let me introduce myself. You can call me Asem. I am the proud king of our tribe, whom the others call “The Children of the Rainbows”. Fitting title. We lived, we prospered, we expanded and we advanced under the light of the rainbows. They are our home, in a sense. Now, you who wear the insignia of the containers, look at the sky and tell me what you see.
&gt;
&gt; //Camera is shown turning towards the sky visible from the room. Rainbows are shown to cover multiple patches of sky.//
&gt; **Charlie:** Wow,dang. What the-..?
&gt;
&gt; **Asem:** Beautiful sight,is it not? That’s why all of you should always stare at your skies. Now, container, tell me. What was your purpose coming to our hills? Sightseeing,perhaps?
&gt;
&gt; **Charlie:** You’re classified as a Species of Interest of this dimension. SoI-002. We were sent to investigate. A recon team…
&gt;
&gt; **Asem:** Your usual behaviour, as I’ve been informed by our great one. What are these other “Species of Interest” you have found within these lands?
&gt;
&gt; **Charlie:** It’s classified information, but… there’s a group of nocturnal cats, a bunch of cats that can create other cats made out of some horrid masses of flesh, cats that replace certain body parts of theirs with machines…and cats who make sushi spin.
&gt;
&gt; **Asem:** Ah. The Children of the Leaves, the Meöwlka, the Tails of Metal, and the ones from the lands far away. Do not be afraid,human. There is much weirdness in this world of ours. It is all part of the natural order of the universe. You’ll get adjusted to it, soon. Like I adjusted to this shining crown. Now, go. And on your way back, you might stumble across our king.
&gt;
&gt; **Charlie:** Wha-?
//A Way immediately opens behind Charlie, Alpha, and Beta, transferring them back to Baseline Reality, at Site-17.//
&gt;
&gt; [END LOG]

&gt; Following the first recon operation, the existence of a species of feline adjacent to baseline reality ‘s [[[Project PARAGON Hub|Children of the Sun]]] has been officially confirmed. Due to this, and the aforementioned behaviour of said race, an alliance with the inhabitants of SCP-6848-A could be created.

Project AILOUROS is an attempt to successfully, and permanently connect all layers of baseline reality to the mirror dimension known as SCP-6848-A. Additional purpose of Project AILOUROS is to form a diplomatic bond, and potentially even an alliance, with who is referred to as “the overlord” of SCP-6848-A. This can potentially be achieved via recursive testing with feline entities under Foundation custody. This testing is done in order for the entities to cross to SCP-6848-A and relay an alliance proposal to “the overlord”. In order to permanently link baseline reality to SCP-6848-A, three pieces of anomalous technology (otherwise known as paratech) are deployed. The below addendums detail the mechanisms and purpose of each one.

[[/div]]

------


++ //Additional Paratech// - PROJECT AILOUROS

&gt; **Addendum 6848.2:**  **Scranton-Rosen-Fortune wormhole drill**
&gt; The Scranton-Rosen-Fortune wormhole drill is used to intercept the temporary Rosen-Fortune bridge formed during an SCP-6848 event by drilling a wormhole through reality, which then connects to the eventual ending point of the Rosen-Fortune bridge. This causes a spatial dislocation at the site of interception, “stamping” the wormhole onto the Rosen-Fortune bridge. In that way, the wormhole and the Rosen-Fortune bridge are dependent on each other. Due to the Scranton-Rosen-Fortune drill being powered by an endless energy source, the Rosen-Fortune bridge is endlessly dependent on it for its existence and as thus will keep existing for an infinite amount of time. 
&gt; Simultaneously, the spatial anomaly at the site of the subject ‘s disappearance starts restructuring reality around it into parts of SCP-6848. When this occurs, a XACTS machine is utilised to temporarily stabilise the spatial anomaly. Failure of stabilisation could potentially lead to a localised CK-class reality restructuring scenario within the area of effect.
&gt;
&gt; After these operations are complete, “Zweihander” will be activated.

&gt; **Addendum 6848.3:**  **Thaumic emission transmitter “Zweihander”**
&gt; Thaumic emission transmitter Zweihander is used to output signals of thaumic energy directly at the modified Rosen-Fortune bridge between SCP-6848-A. Afterwards, MTF-Æ-7 “Cathauma” will engage in the completion of advanced thaumaturgical rituals in order to cancel the spatial anomalies created by the creation of a Rosen-Fortune bridge during an SCP-6848 event. These rituals follow a phrase and counter-phrase mechanism similar to ##green|the woods with no name##, albeit the counter-phrases are additionally amplified to override the phrases, by the use of an in-built occult amplifier within Zweihander, manufactured by the Alchemy Department.
&gt;
&gt; After these operations are complete, the ZXCH narrative layer linker is activated.

&gt; **Addendum 6848.4:**  **ZXCH narrative layer linker**
&gt; The ZXCH narrative layer linker is a machine developed by [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/placeholder-mcd-s-authorpage|Dir. Ph. Mc. D.]]] in collaboration with the Pataphysics department. It utilises the principles of the pataphysical entity [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3043|Murphy Law]]] ‘s narrative flattening in order to complete the acceleration process of selected narrative vortexes. It was built under supervision by Project Lead Dir. James Fisher.
&gt;
&gt; The ZXCH narrative layer linker pataphysically links the narrative layers of SCP-6848-A and baseline reality. This is done via the “acceleration” of narrative vortexes within baseline reality and SCP-6848-A. The “acceleration” (the process of rapidly expanding the reach of the narrative vortex), leads to the narrative vortexes within both dimensions eventually break through the bounds of their respective dimensions and create a sort of “narrativic hazard” between the two dimensions. This narrativic hazard then self-stabilises and creates a narrativic gateway between SCP-6848-A and baseline reality. This gateway equates the rate of narrative progress [[footnote]] How fast a narrative advances to future events, starting from a set point in time.[[/footnote]] between the two narrative layers, thus achieving a “perfect synchronisation” between baseline reality and SCP-6848-A.
&gt;
&gt; After completion of these operations,an alliance request is sent to SCP-6848-A. If the alliance is rejected (an event which is highly unlikely), [[[SCP-140|SCP-140]]] is used to rewrite the events that transpired.
