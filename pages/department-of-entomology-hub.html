Welcome to the Department of Entomology.

Here at Site-95, we&#39;re an odd bunch. Despite being almost unheard of by the overseer council, the bottom of all the jokes by the other departments and being constantly underfunded, we are an important department here. You might be thinking: //Insects? How can they be important?// And you would be right, but this place is full of people working for a single unified goal: to make the world a better place. No matter how small someone is, they can make a difference, even by containing some small insects. That&#39;s one less anomaly that could have destroyed the veil.

We are just ordinary people, doing ordinary things in an extraordinary world.

Welcome aboard, I hope you&#39;ll enjoy your stay.

[[tab Overview]]

The Department of Entomology is a Foundation department originally created for [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/department-contest Department-Con 2022] by [[*user Radiantgold]], [[*user REDESERT]] and [[*user Stealth000]]. It primarily deals with insectoid anomalies and how to contain, research and potentially use them to their benefit. Their articles tend to be smaller in scale and more slice of life, with a undertone of chaos, however you can take on darker concepts as seen in SCP-6220. Generally, the department does not contain larger threats, but if you do write about them facing these threats, make sure they are overwhelmed and only win by some sort of miracle.

[[include component:image-block name=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/916930272396738580/1173202212076400723/Site-95.png?ex=656318b4&amp;is=6550a3b4&amp;hm=f148cce2b6189361bd39061281e266ede3987c14532f33c3189f1aa247e18a4e&amp;|width=50%|align=right|caption= Site insignia.]]

 After being taken from a wealthy family on account of practicing demonic rituals, Site-95 was originally established as a small testing facility. After SCP-6220 arrived on site, the site became a containment and research site for biological entities. Along with this change, the Entomology, Mycology and Botany departments were formed.

Today, Site-95 is known as the headquarters of the Entomology department as well as a major hub for the Mycology and Botany departments. Site-95 is usually known for its relaxed yet chaotic attitude and difficult exams for entrance. The site is one of the most densely populated facilities within the Foundation earning it a large reputation. Despite this, the site still has controversies due to it being one of the last sites to still contain D-class.

Arguably, the site&#39;s main attraction is the large site garden. It is commonly used to experiment and contain anomalies and when not in use, it is often used by members for relaxation purposes. The Botany Department solely manages and is responsible for the upkeep of the garden, gaining them a sense of admiration from their peers.

Site-95 is often laughed at from the wider Foundation, despite this it is rapidly growing and boasts a large amount of intellectuals and academics.

[[tab Writing Guide]]

You want to write for the Department of Entomology? Congrats, great! There are a few things to be aware of though:

The Department of Entomology is a loose canon, there are no plans for a full canon. It can fit into most other canons and is flexible, you are however encouraged to use characters, anomalies and lore if you so desire.

I know this is applicable for most other departments and canons, but before you write anything, //read, read, read// the already existing stories. These will help you get an idea on the themes and ideas here. I would recommend reading [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/entomology-intro-tale &#34;Sorry to bug you, Director...&#34;] first and then looking at the other articles.

You may additionally use the foxtrot theme on your article but it&#39;s by no means necessary.

Here are some themes and tones to consider:

**Slice of Life:** How is it like working at the Foundation? What are the relationships between all the staff? How do they interact with the anomalies? These are all good questions that you could answer.

**Forgotten:** The Department of Entomology is usually forgotten due to its size. They are often underfunded due to this and their resources are limited. How does the department react to this? 

**Comedy:** Some articles such as SCP-7386 aim at comedy. Comedy is greatly welcomed here, due to the uniqueness of the department. Don&#39;t be afraid to try make a funny article.

**Heartwarming:** Consider the anomalies, a lot of them are harmless and free. The workers are regularly encouraged to play with non-dangerous anomalies. Sometimes, your stories don&#39;t have to be big or grand.

**Other departments:** The Mycology and Botany departments are also there at Site-95, they have a sort of friendly rivalry. Consider the other departments and how they would react to what the Entomology department does. You could even have a partnership between all 3 departments to contain one singular anomaly.

**Odd:** Most of the people here are odd, maybe even more so the anomalies they are working with. Really lean into the whole odd aspect of it, there&#39;s a reason why their motto is &#34;Odd is to be expected.&#34;

Lastly, you&#39;re always free to contact [[*user Stealth000]] if you have any questions or simply have a draft that you want me to see.
