&gt; Most documentation regarding SCP-6600 and associated events has been made available to surviving Foundation Staff. These documents contain all necessary information regarding SCP-6600.

+ 

+ 

**Event Recovery Procedures:** 





SCP-6600 has prevented the Foundation’s core objectives from being completed. Until the damages sustained during EE-6600[[footnote]]Extranormal Event 6600.[[/footnote]] have been repaired, the Foundation has updated its missions to ensure the continued stability of civilisation and the Foundation upon SCP-6600-1.



**Re-contain:**
To recapture or neutralise all anomalies.
* Due to the destruction of formic colonies tasked with containment, containment efforts shall be undertaken directly by Foundation operatives. This will result in a decreased level of efficiency as the number of operatives drops drastically
* Escaped anomalies that cannot be apprehended easily are to be terminated with extreme prejudice
* All disposable anomalies with high-maintenance containment procedures, Keters with a Risk Class of Warning or higher, and Thaumiels lacking any conceivable application are to be assessed for neutralization


**Re-Group:**
To ensure the unity of the Foundation and the entire species.
* Analysis of SCP-6600-1 indicates the possibility of other Foundation Sites and cities being scattered in other realities. Further exploration and investigation into the Multiverse will be initiated once the aftermath of EE-6600 is stabilised
* Attempting to aid individuals who have been altered by SCP-6600-1 is one of the Foundation’s goals, but rejoining with those who have retained their individuality is the highest priority
* Any rescued individuals who have not become SCP-6600-2 instances that are unaffiliated with the Foundation shall be immediately recruited and assigned level 2 access
* Males will be temporarily permitted to enter all positions generally reserved for females, excepting department heads and Directorial positions
 

**Rebuild:**
To ensure the restoration of society as it was before EE-6600.
* Foundation chemists are to fixate on altering the chemical composition of formic control pheromones to function in the atmosphere of SCP-6600-1
* The formic population of SCP-6600-1 are to be domesticated and interbred with those surviving from Universe Prime, to adapt them to better survive the SCP-6600-1 atmosphere
* Chambers below Site-67 are to be excavated and appropriately laid with pheromones by Foundation personnel to serve as space for formic factories and calculators. The chambers must be prepared for immediate inhabitation and functionality upon the establishment of a formic worker colony on SCP-6600-1
* Algae farms can provide for Site-67’s current food requirements. SCP-6600-1&#39;s native mammalian wildlife is being screened for edibility and farming viability
* An investigation into feasible ways of raising the atmospheric oxygen levels of SCP-6600-1, or otherwise counteracting the long-term effects of hypoxia is underway
* All personnel are required to submit genetic material to be used in artificial incubation
* Plans for a subterranean residential compound for civilians will be initiated upon sufficient population growth

Upon the completion of these objectives, the Foundation will resume its Secure, Contain, Protect motto; stabilisation of the Multiversal Web via containment of SCP-6600 will become another primary objective. EE-6600 has made the Veil protocol impossible to uphold. All survivors of EE-6600 are to be immediately inducted into the Foundation. In future, widespread amnesticisation programmes may be used to reestablish normalcy.

Staff are to remain within habitats at all time, unless on an approved expedition. All operatives entering SCP-6600-1 must be equipped with a pheromone flare, oxygen supply, and ample webbing.





&gt; **Note to Operatives:**
&gt; Our situation provides no margin for error.
&gt; There will be zero tolerance for dissidence. Disobedience is grounds for summary execution. You have been warned.
&gt; **- Security Chief Ness**






**Event Description:** EE-6600 refers to the events following the severance of SCP-6600-1 from the Multiversal Web. 

Upon Reality ♮-1&#39;s disconnection from the Web, it immediately began dissolution. The majority of Reality ♮-1&#39;s unreinforced mass ceased to exist; due to the actions taken by Site-67, some Foundation and civic infrastructure survived. Those individuals that were not converted to SCP-6600-2 instances during EE-6600 were encouraged to assemble at Site-67, the most stable remaining Foundation emplacement.

After two weeks of drifting across the Web, after which almost all matter in the universe had been destroyed, Reality ♮-1 collided with Reality ♯-597, henceforth referred to as SCP-6600-1. In the case of Reality ♮-1+♯-597 collision, the matter remaining in Reality ♮-1 was overlaid directly onto SCP-6600-1. 

SCP-6600-1 is a universe containing an alternate Earth in which the High O2 Period ended 250 million years ago, dropping to 21% atmospheric O2 levels and preventing the development and dominance of arachnid species. Extended exposure to SCP-6600-1’s atmosphere may cause permanent damage to cognitive functions. 

Arachnids and insects on SCP-6600-1 have not developed sophisticated lungs, brains, or circulatory systems. Mammalian lifeforms have become the largest, most developed species.

Prior to EE-6600, Site-67 had been outfitted with linings of Scranton Reality Thread. The SRT ensured stability during the universal dissolution. However, Site-67&#39;s two main buildings were separated during the universal merge. The lost fragment of Site-67 is designated Site-68. The status of Site-68 is unknown. 

The SRT ensured Site-67 personnel&#39;s survival, but the Site’s seal’s integrity was compromised. The atmosphere of SCP-6600-1 rendered formic control pheromones ineffective, and members of the Site-67 formic colony began to attack personnel and one another. Surviving staff retreated to the Site’s lower levels and isolated the colony queens. Spiders and formics remaining on the surface asphyxiated and rebuild procedures commenced on Site-67. Site-67 experienced a personnel loss of only 23% and a loss of 83% of its formic colony.

An artificial atmosphere with higher oxygen content was created within Site-67 by flooding unused lower areas and introducing algae, then pumping outside air through the filter.

The entire spider population[[footnote]]Except those within in Site-67.[[/footnote]] has been converted to SCP-6600-2. SCP-6600-2 are physically and mentally altered spiders that have become diminutive and rapidly adapted to coexist in the ecosystems which they were overlaid upon during the universal collision. SCP-6600-2 have lost all cognitive ability, showing no signs of recognition, or intelligent response to stimuli.

No way of restoring SCP-6600-2 has been found. The Security Chief has permitted containment of SCP-6600-2 specimens which were formerly female Site-67 staff until a treatment is found.



**Discovery of Survivors:** 

On July 5th, 2034, Mobile Task Force Captain Charlotte Jenkins and Field Agent Portia Burgeons appeared outside of the perimeter of Site-67. Burgeons was unharmed, however, Jenkins was suffering from limb liquefication due to an internalized low Hume level, a consequence of being displaced outside with sufficient enough distance from Scranton Reality Threading. 

Upon being interviewed, both Burgeons and Jenkins gave the following statement:

They had both returned to the current reality after walking along a singular strand of SRT. Upon entering the current reality, they emerged in thick shrubbery. From there, they attempted to recuperate, however, they fled when they witnessed massive hairless appendages striking the ground.  

From there, they tracked the current members of the Foundation by locating &#39;knots&#39; of SRT and following the trail. 



**Attempted Rescue Mission:** 

On September 6th, 2034, a scouting team was deployed to Area-0 for reconnaissance. There, scout leader Greggs ascended a tree and spotted large bipeds of mammalian descent. Entities displayed signs of intelligence, engaging in tool use and a form of audial communication.

One of these entities noticed Greggs and uttered a loud vocalization before turning around and fleeing from his presence. Another of these entities approached and observed Greggs, appearing to study him. The entity then chastised the other for fleeing before turning around and leaving, seemingly disinterested. 



The behaviours of these entities have been markedly inconsistent. Extreme caution is advised when approaching. 


Further encounters with these entities have shown them to be sapient, with organised tribal social structures. They have been designated //humans//[[footnote]] Their designation directly translates from Spider Sign Language as: //Intelligent Biped// [[/footnote]]. Their technology hinges on manipulation of the physical world, rather than chemical manipulation. Human populations are spread throughout the region surrounding Site-67. Humans are likely the dominant species on SCP-6600-1 in terms of intelligence.

**Site Director Celeste&#39;s Plan:** 


[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

= **AUDIO LOG** 
----
**DATE:** 8/8/2036

**NOTE:** Site Director Celeste details ser plan to direct the newly discovered human race into forming their own iteration of the SCP Foundation. 
----

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

Alright so hear me out, please. As much of a long shot as this is, I am willing to propose a plan. A really big shot in the dark, yes, but considering how few our numbers are, and how more than half of the remaining members are trying to eat each other&#39;s heads, I&#39;m willing to take the risk. 

As much as most of you have been trying to deny it, our species isn&#39;t the dominant one anymore. No. There&#39;s no way we can compete with something like...//them.// So here&#39;s my plan: we help them. We give them some of our technology while staying just out of eyesight. 

As far as we can tell, they&#39;re following the same basic path we took in the formation of our Foundation. This planet has a Hume baseline the same as our own before SCP-6600 began. Though their technology is different, Statistics says that there&#39;s a 91% chance that these primitives will also form their equivalent in the future.

...Yes, I am suggesting that we spend our time and waiting to see what happens. Yes, I am aware this is absurd. No, I don&#39;t have any better ideas. No, I am //not// willing to hear any suggestions. 

Celeste out.

**Studying the Humans:** 

After discovering these bipeds, Director Celeste has allocated resources for an on-site research facility. 


Added below is a timeline of humanity&#39;s progress. 



||~ Date||~ Occurrence|| 
||~ May 8th, 2035|| A small group of humans was seen observing a region of reality deteriorating from low amounts of SRT. It is currently unknown if they are capable of perceiving it, however, they seem to have an innate understanding of its dangers.|| 
||~ June 14th, 2035|| Human technology is extremely primitive. Current calculations state that humans will not naturally advance to the Foundation&#39;s level of technology for another 50,000 years. Steps are currently being taken to speed up this process. ||
||~ November 6th, 2037|| A method of initiating localized time-sinks has been discovered. By destabilising Site-67 in a controlled manner, the surrounding area can teleport across large amounts of time. The ratio of time elapsed in SCP-6600-1 to time elapsed in Site-67 is 50:1. Dates will be recorded from SCP-6600-1&#39;s time-stream. ||
||~ January 23rd, 2038|| Formic drones adapted to survive on SCP-6600-1 have been dispatched to the surrounding area to supply human tribes with raw metal. ||
||~ January 24th, 2038|| It has been discovered that the Foundation cannot move backwards along the human timeline, only forwards. Immense care is to be taken in directing human development efficiently. ||
||~ February 5th, 4051|| Human tribes have assembled into large cities. Technology has developed to the point where humans can be introduced to the concept of the anomalous. **Note:** Mobile Task Force Sigma-X (&#34;Human Evolution&#34;) has been created to forward human progress. ||
||~ March 11th, 4051|| Sigma-X leader, Mara Stephens, proposes releasing SCP-███ into a human. The minor destruction caused by SCP-███, coupled with its indestructibility, would force humans to establish containment procedures for it. Director Celeste denied this proposal, instead advocating for observance with minimal interaction. ||
||~ April 11th, 4051|| After Director Celeste died of age-related complications, Mara Stephens elected herself Director. Director Stephens authorised the release of numerous SCPs[[footnote]] Notably SCP-███, SCP-██ instances, and SCP-███ [[/footnote]] into several human cities. ||
||~ June 1st, 4051|| Director Stephens proposed an operation to capture humans for research. The operation chiefly consists of dissections and exposure to memetic agents and cognitohazards. ||
||~ May 11th, 4051|| The Human Research Programme was partially successful[[footnote]] See: //Results of comprehensive human examination// by Sylvia Clyde  [[/footnote]]. It was discovered that humans are extremely //sus//ceptible to memetic agents. It is possible to create memetics that target humans, with effects great enough to induce heart attacks. The programme was aborted after a human undergoing vivisection breached containment, killing two researchers before formic defence forces neutralised it. ||
||~ May 29th, 4053|| In some cases, the SCPs became the objects of religious worship, rather than containment. In these instances, the anomalies were re-contained by MTF Sigma-X. At this time a decrease in Hume levels was recorded, potentially indicating SCP-6600 taking effect on SCP-6600-1. The Hume decrease will now allow anomalous objects to form on their own in SCP-6600-1. Director Stephens has authorised the majority of site staff to go into induced comas in preparation for a several thousand-year time-leap. ||
||~ May 27th, 6854|| The Foundation has found a period in the human timeline where their technology has reached a sufficient state to be able to potentially integrate Foundation equipment into their development. ||
||~ September 6th, 6857|| A piece of Foundation technology was placed in what is presumed to be a Research and Development Laboratory, as well as several SRT-Manipulation Needles. [[footnote]] A needle specifically made to be used by Foundation personnel who lack the innate potential to manipulate SRT.  [[/footnote]] || 
||~ September 14th, 6858|| Human R&amp;D has yet to figure out how to use SRT-Manipulation Needles to appropriately repair SRTs and restore and repair reality. ||
||~ December 25th, 6858|| Human scientists have been witnessed shutting down their laboratories and engaging in what resembles a facsimile of warfare; minor explosives and pyrotechnics can be seen bursting in mid-air, somehow spelling words related to the topics of, &#39;holiday&#39; and &#39;cheer&#39;. Proper definitions of these phrases are currently unknown. Fascimile of warfare resulted in no loss of life. ||
||~ January 1st, 6860|| Location with frayed and damaged threading has been found near a human laboratory. Foundation personnel were sent with SRT-Manipulation Needles to reattach and repair threading to that area of reality. A circular distortion field manifested, gaining the attention of human scientists. Foundation personnel were ordered to retreat and return to HQ. ||
||~ February 5th, 6860|| Loose strands of SRT were seen stretching and becoming taut. Current reasoning is unknown; likely influenced by a breakthrough in reality-bending research by humans. ||
||~ February 7th, 6860|| Humanity&#39;s research in the anomalous seems to have advanced far more quickly than original statistics predicted; outlines of what resemble buildings and entities in motion can be seen beyond the distortion field. All resources are to be dedicated to monitoring this anomaly. ||


[[/collapsible]]




**August 7th, 6860**: An anomalous avian creature emerged from the distortion field.
A human approached and brandished a cylindrical telescopic device [[footnote]] Later confirmed to be a human-made equivalent of a Scranton Reality Anchor. [[/footnote]]constructed out of primarily stainless steel. He quickly placed it into the ground; from there, three prongs emerged and implanted themselves into the soil to keep it upright.

Strands of SRT quickly began to unravel and gravitate towards the cylindrical object, gathering and tangling around the anomalous entity in the process, quickly subduing it. 

After the anomalous entity was contained by the humans, Agent Graham Fosters infiltrated their laboratory and covertly examined the tool that was used. She had confirmed that SRT-Manipulation Needles were used as parts for the device. A currently unrecognized element of metal was also found in the device, presumably to amplify the Needle&#39;s effects. 




**Regrouping with Missing Personnel:** 

On November 19th, 6860, the spatial distortion field de-manifested and Site-68 reappeared near Site-67. From there, Rescue Team Captain Carl Shaws initiated the investigation of Site-68. Video log added below. 



[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

= **VIDEO LOG** 
------
**Date:** November 19, 6860

**Note:** Video feed was captured using a helmet-mounted camera. 
------

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

//&lt;Video feed turns on, showing Shaws&#39; face.&gt;// 


This is Sigma-X&#39;s Captain, Carl Shaws. We&#39;ve arrived at the rendezvous point. We&#39;ve found our missing personnel!

//&lt;Shaws turns the camera around and puts it on his head. Site-68&#39;s front doors are open; survivors can be seen exiting, escorted by the Rescue Squad.&gt;// 

Of the personnel we were searching for, we&#39;ve located 90%, total. 15% of the located personnel are dead, and 10% of them are critically injured. My crew is currently entering in hopes of locating more. I do apologize if this breaks my professionalism, but...this is great. We&#39;ve found each other. After all this time...

//&lt;The spatial distortion field re-manifests.&gt;// 

...what the hell...?

//&lt;Strands of SRT snap out of the ground and rapidly unravel.&gt;// 

Shit! Everyone, get out of there! GET THE FUCK OUT NOW!

//&lt;The remaining personnel all attempt to dash out of the front doors and past the failing SRT strands. Site-68 as well as its respective plot of land drift away from Site-67, a massive fissure forming in between them. Several individuals trip and fall into the void below. The spatial distortion field stretches outwards in size, quickly encompassing the entirety of Site-68.&gt;// 

No! No! We were so God damn close! 


//&lt;Site-68 disappears again.&gt;//
