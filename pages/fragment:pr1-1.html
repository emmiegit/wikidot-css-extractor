[[image https://i.imgur.com/5n9ludDm.png width=&#34;300px&#34;]]
honestly, 3000 is one of the more overbuilt SCPs out there, and honestly I find the build up to how awesome it is by other people to sorta ruin it for me. it&#39;s not by any stretch of the word bad tho, and i really enjoyed the imagery of having ur entire life just light out of ur brain like a battery draining and then getting --vored epic style-- consumed and just... fucking melt away. that is pretty creepy.

mmmm 3138 was really good and fun i had to draw it. there is something really entertaining about hiding a body in a fucking book.

i really enjoy the tone this story went through, and the fact it wasn&#39;t exactly based off any scp leads me to have a small headcanon about it. i should probably read the doomsday team about birds since i love birds so much.

[[image https://i.imgur.com/S8cFX8Qm.png width=&#34;300px&#34;]]
1026-RU has the most cliche design, yet i love it so much. its one of the older russian scps so i guess it&#39;s excusable, plus its pretty entertaining to read. i really like the part when it got **//thick...//** after hearing about an all you can eat buffet being held at the foundation. it&#39;s a rlly odd one.

SCP-471-JP is one of my favorite -JPs, and I do really like my design for it. The fact that it&#39;s basically a urban legend made me helpless in giving him a really goofy looking &#34;scary&#34; face.

this was a dumb crossover with SCP and an indie horror game i like that got fucking 300+ on reddit. i guess ill list down what all the characters are.
playtime is 053, baldi is 993, it&#39;s a bully is 303, the principle of the thing is 036-JP-1, arts and crafters is a sock with 1439 on it, and Gotta Sweep is 1837.

i had fun making this one and i even put it in SCP-682-J.

you know, the entire reason i want to add this is because it&#39;s a fuck you to /r/SCP! some random asshole told me it was shitty and i got really stressed out cuz im a pussy and took it off. well now its officially on the wiki so take that random asshole.

[[image https://i.imgur.com/UUb6WBAm.png width=&#34;300px&#34;]]
baldi&#39;s basics recently had an update so i decided to draw the two new characters introduced.

1st Prize is 2521 and Filename2 (the character in the hidden ending) is 2786.

1st Prize is such a pain in the ass because he&#39;s just a more bothersome Gotta Sweep.

i went on the international scp discord and requested for requests and Zhange asked if i could do BumaroIon, I asked for references which is why they both look rlly similar to how zhange draws the two.

I think I did ok but I am bad at drawing clothing and stuff which is why my people are usually just bleach white and naked looking.

It was fucking hilarious. thx fnaf porn lover for being a hilarious buffoon further proving that people dont hate my art as much as they just hate my style.

I tried to capture the essence of this SCP with my drawing, I don&#39;t think I did very well but it was worth a shot, the animation is a test because the SCP is experimental so I tried being experimental and IDK if it worked, I&#39;m trying new things and shit weee.

update: i can&#39;t get enough of 280-FR it turns out, i drew ANOTHER piece of it. i was inspired by shaggydreadlocks talking about faceless protagonists and i wanted to draw something that had the same feeling of a faceless protag, also yes, i can&#39;t get over the faces i drew for this one either, animals are the fucking best thing ever.
