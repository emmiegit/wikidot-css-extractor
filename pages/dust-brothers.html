||//Five Cities rap collective Fifth Family released this as the second single from their debut album, &#34;2845&#34;. &#34;Dust Brothers&#34; failed to match the success of their first single, &#34;Andromeda State of Mind&#34;. Quintopolis Magazine gave the track three stars out of four and praised its &#34;East Coast-style, stripped down production&#34; by DJ QuInn and the lyrics by TK StarLyte, but wasn&#39;t thrilled with the unusual numbers of bars in each verse, saying the layout was &#34;a violation&#34; and &#34;lacked the highest transcendence&#34; expected from &#34;true Five Cities rap&#34;.//||

[Intro: Gospodin]

Take mind and worldview and adjust
Take heed that starstuff is above us
uh, come on
StarLyte, bring it in, man

[Verse 1: TK StarLyte]

Just rebuff the inimitable and despicable
cynical and traditional, Biblical and unlivable
wicked world governmental and digital individuals
spitting full mythic mythical lyrics of unthinkable
bigots and biggest bullshit distributors on this spherical
pinnacle of people making themselves miserable; it&#39;s a
mirror realm of a horror show; fictions dwell all among us though
fearful of human predators needing to feel full control
fearful of people preaching to reach the top of the totem pole
fearful of lethal keepers, machinists eager to take the soul
fearful of fearsome criminal elements up in sterile developments
up in underground cellars and it&#39;s difficult quelling distress
among all the spirits that miss people defending it
instead of doctor vultures experimenting and rending it
instead of directors attempting bidding, buying and selling it
instead of the heretics bending, blending and ending it
instead of the rebels recruiting, wasting, expending it
instead of isolationist Meccans pretending penitence
Accept befriending the spirit and transcending
a mending of five descended directions I&#39;m recommending so --

[Hook]

Take mind and worldview and then adjust
Take heed that starstuff is above us
Dismiss the visible physical, put the lyrical syllable
in your geopolitical, and become dust

Take mind and worldview and then adjust
Do not breathe, our brothers are still among us
Belie the pitiful mimics inside of hidden positions
Ignore the timidest critics, and become dust
dust, dust, dust

[Verse 2: Gospodin]

Fifthist visions can christen the spirit fearless
and squish the predispositions to seek the angels and villains
and witness the living divisions riddling men and women
and form the kind of religion needed to free from prison
the part of the spirit that listens; do not feel forgiven
if forgiveness is the precondition already written; if
the crime committed is thinking and acting without supervision 
and submission is the only disposition that helps
Find a prophet with a message and no product to sell
Give a minute of commitment while a messenger tells
of the stellar body dwellers with celestial shells
and the protection that they offer from the curse in our cells
You cannot wake up; this is the world as it exists
You can&#39;t look away in dismay when the orbitals twist
As the planet turns and swivels, dunking into the mist
Let your body turn to vapor, let the spirit persist

[Hook: TK StarLyte and Gospodin]

Take mind and worldview and then adjust
Take heed that starstuff is above us
Dismiss the visible physical, put the lyrical syllable
in your geopolitical, and become dust

Take mind and worldview and then adjust
Do not breathe, our brothers are still among us
Belie the pitiful mimics inside of hidden positions
Ignore the timidest critics, and become dust

//The hook relates to traditional Five Cities themes of transcendence from the horrors of the streets into celestial harmony.//

&gt; Biblical and unlivable
//Lyricist TK StarLyte was asked whether the track laid down here was supposed to be anti-Christian in particular, given the reference to the Bible. StarLyte responded &#34;Base texts, baby. Ain&#39;t level to be spoken about. No tucks.&#34;//

&gt; directors attempting bidding, buying and selling it
//TK StarLyte&#39;s stance on companies profiting from natural miracles in this world is well documented, given his 1999 arrest for conspiracy to commit arson along with four other Five Cities enthusiasts at Darke Plaza in New York.//

&gt; squish the predispositions to seek the angels and villains
//Fifth Family&#39;s emcee Gospodin wrote this shortly after becoming the director of the Lower East Side Five Cities Truth Center in Manhattan. His philosophy on Fifthism was particularly targeted towards a &#34;moral gray zone&#34;, with no clearly defined good or evil in the world. Even the Celestial Ascendance supported by Five Cities advocates wasn&#39;t immune in Gospodin&#39;s eyes, who described it as &#34;one journey among many, all beings once smoke must burn high, but feel no love for the road.&#34;//
