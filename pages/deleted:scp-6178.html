**Item #:** SCP-6178

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment is focussed on disseminating misinformation surrounding SCP-6178, comparing it to an urban myth. Foundations web-crawlers should be utilised in removing records of SCP-6178.

Physical containment is not currently possible due to the size and scope of SCP-6178. Foundations satellites should be used to pinpoint potential SCP-6178 manifestations, with local MTF operatives then being utilised to prevent civilians interacting with it. Amnestics may be administered to civilians who have witnessed SCP-6178.

**Description:** SCP-6178 is an emaciated humanoid entity, covered in severe wounds sustained from bullets and bludgeoning weapons, many of its limbs are deformed or missing. SCP-6178 is nude, lacking genitalia or any other defining characteristics, besides its eye sockets which are empty, instead containing green luminophore compounds. These compounds measure roughly 600 lumens at any given time. Specialised circular and radial muscles allow SCP-6178 to focus this light.

SCP-6178 is an associative entity, only manifesting when a human subject is present. Manifestations primarily occur within the boreal forest regions of North America. SCP-6178 will maintain itself at a distance from the subject, usually at an elevated point, whether it is a hill, tree, or man-made structure.

SCP-6178&#39;s moves by rapidly being ejected from its current position to another. Invariably, SCP-6178 will collide with surrounding flora sustaining damage through broken bones and cuts, however, SCP-6178 will not react to this. High speed cameras have shown SCP-6178 to be limp during these movements.

SCP-6178 is only capable of manifesting during nightfall or overcast.

**Testing Log:** D-225 was tasked to enter the boreal forest located in Thompson, Manitoba in Canada, in the hopes of manifesting SCP-6178. The log has been transcribed below.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

//D-225 is fitted with a body camera and microphone. He is walking along a footpath, using a torch to illuminate his way. D-225 stops walking.//

**Command:** No activity, please continue.

**D-225:** C&#39;mon man, it&#39;s creepy out here.

**Command:** Please continue down the path.

**D-225:** Fuck me man.

**Command:** Please refrain from profanity, it makes the editors job easier.

//D-225 sheepishly continues walking. The camera feed is interrupted by a green light.//

**Command:** Can you check the camera please?

**D-225:** Huh… there&#39;s some kind of laser on my chest. Oh shit… it&#39;s not a gun is it?

//D-225 stops, noticing blooding dripping down onto his shoulder.//

**D-225:** There&#39;s some shit dripping down from the trees.

//D-225 points the torch upwards, the camera revealing at least 5 mangled cadavers, twisted and wrapped around the branches. D-225 panics and runs back down the path.//

**Command:** Hey…

**Command:** (Away from the microphone) Do you see that? It&#39;s like floodlights in the distance behind the hill.

//D-225 is running, however, stops as something fast flashes past him. This causes D-225 to fall over.//

**D-225:** Guys guys… you gotta help me out a little here?

**Command:** (Away from the microphone) Look at how fast it&#39;s moving, wow, ain&#39;t that amazing.

//D-225 is suddenly illuminated in green light.//

**D-225:** Fuck, something&#39;s after me.

//D-225 turns around looking up at SCP-6178, which is warped around a tree trunk 7 metres above the ground. The other bodies are levitating around SCP-6178, appearing to be hanging by an invisible force around their necks. D-225 begins to run away from the path and into the forest.//

**Command:** Step into the light my friend. Green is the colour of life.

**D-225:** (In between breaths) What are you talking about?

**Command:** May you float with the light bringer, granted into his digestive Kingdom to become one with him, high the walls of his stomach be. Cast away thy woes, for the light bringer feeds from them.

//D-225 suddenly falls down a steep hill, tumbling for several seconds before stopping.//

//There is 15 minutes of heavy breathing before camera feed is lost.//

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Past Records:** A journal dating back to the 1630s belonged to Nicholas Edward Thorn, a pilgrim aboard the Mayflower with his family, which came to settle in New England. They came to live on a homestead in rural New York. The journal was absent of dates.

Matthew came down with a sickness, the devil is in his blood, twisting his skin till it turns the colour of ash. Caleb had to help with the farm, but to no avail. Our crop is a black slurry, and won&#39;t grow. I fear I may not be capable of providing for my wife and children. This twisted game we play will only end in our deaths. I just pray more, for the sake of those I hold dear to me. For now we must eat of the slurry, only for now, till we are fruitful once more. Clouds are grey, willing the rain to come, hard hitting, lashing my skin. 
----
Geraldine, my wife, wishes we were back home. I asked if she meant the plantation, yet she cried at this. I told her to come hither into my embrace and so I did, and she cried harder for the rain and our son. She wished to be back in England once more, away from these tall trees. There was no chance of this, we must stake our claim here. Grow our crops, feed our stock, live long lives. She said I was &#39;madder than uncle&#39; but I doubt she meant so. All I wish is to protect those I love, for their sake and the sake of my sanity as I walk into these tall weeds of mine. 
----
Next morning I went to the well, in the rain, soaking my garments. My eyes lied, when I saw flashes of light, the colour of grass in the distance through the shroud. The rope of the well was lined with viscera, the bucket red with dilute blood, the smell of gunpowder. I thought my rifle may have been tampered with, but it was still resting by the fireplace. The well was unusable, the taste made me empty my contents from last night&#39;s meal. Nothing sat right.
----
The sun crowned over the horizon to show dawn was in full swing. The fire stoked, cooking meat, rabbit and goat. The cow&#39;s milk was black and rotten, an odour barely tolerable by at least a dozen paces. I saw the flashes once more, from a figure in the woods, tied around a tree. His arms were wrapped like a noose around his neck. A figure of the devil I think. It shifted as I brought my wife&#39;s cross to it, dragged away deeper into the woods by nothing.

I decided to bring Caleb to the river, with our fishing rods and the rifle. Salmon we hoped for, or something similar. When we arrived at the river, the smell of gunpowder had returned. I told Caleb to stand away as I readied my rifle, loading the pellet and powder, tapping it down. The figure was in the trees, masked by fog, glowing eyes piercing through it. I aimed and shot, the powder blinding me as I dropped my weapon. Through the grit, I saw the hole carved into the tree bark, blood dripping from it also. I wiped my eyes and hastily began to reload, calling for Caleb to stay close and in the safety of my presence. I saw the figure darting around the distant trees, my bullet barely slowing it. 

A flash of light and we were illuminated. I only thought of death in those moments, the light taking me and my boy, but I brought my rifle up and fired into the figure&#39;s face, stopping its approach. At that time I caught my son&#39;s hand and ran, leaving the rods and bucket, keeping the rifle under my armpit. I dragged us both through the forest till home was in sight.

I hurriedly walked through the game, but Caleb was no longer grasping my hand. In a panic I looked for him, but I heard the inhuman sounds of the figure which now sat atop my roof, and fearing for Matthew I stormed in and climbed the ladder. He was still resting, and so I laid my gun down beside him to comfort his weak state. 
----
My wife was beyond distraught, crying till she slept. Each time I left in search of Caleb, I felt the figures present against the window of my home, it&#39;s black fingers prying at the glass. I could not risk Matthew&#39;s life, so I stayed with him during the night, my weapon loaded. I heard its footsteps on the thatch of my roof. 

I prayed and prayed, repeating verse after verse to be rid of this beast, yet its howls only grew louder till I could no longer bear to leave my ears nude.
----
My wife has stopped crying now, and whether she&#39;s asleep or death has taken her, I do not know. Matthew cannot leave my sight, for it now forces its limbs through openings in the roof and walls. I hear it clambering down the fireplace, and cramming itself through the floorboards, cracking bone and tearing skin. Each time I see it, I swing my hatchet, bludgeoning its arms. The onslaught has been ever increasing and I feel myself become weaker and weaker even as I write. I fear I have angered God in some way I am ignorant to, and that I will not be able to fix this. I just hope this devil&#39;s green gaze is not what gets to Matthew.
----
Horrors awaken to the night&#39;s call, and I&#39;ve seen horrors. By the sign of first dawn I looked upon an unholy rite. Dead, twisted bodies danced around a fire, contorting to ritual beats from a hollow tree. Calls of the daemon from deep behind the shrouded trees, caused the bodies to rise, hung by nooses that weren&#39;t there. They were lifted into the black, moonlit sky, as an opening came into being. Spindly arms emerged, clawing at the rising bodies, ripping their living bodies into pieces as the gore rose into the opening. Then silence came as it closed.

The daemon, its glowing eyes, only stared blankly at me through the window. For the first time I saw its grin, and I smiled inhumanly at myself. My dear Matthew was gone, the daemon&#39;s twisted form had stolen him from me and my family.

Nothing awaits me here now. Nothing awaits you. The light was a lie. It&#39;s empty.

It&#39;s empty
It&#39;s empty
It&#39;s empty
It&#39;s empty
It&#39;s empty
It&#39;s empty
It&#39;s empty
It&#39;s empty
It&#39;s empty
It&#39;s empty
It&#39;s empty
