Site Director Lois Calder peered under the thin crawlspace beneath the underside of her desk, and thought of the futility of cowering behind the metal, a vain attempt at avoiding the unavoidable. It would have been too small to fully fit underneath, leaving half of her body facing outward, and the desk itself was flimsy. It would collapse in on itself within moments of the drop.

Lois pulled her head back from under the desk, and looked flatly at the terminal, alongside the attached message. She had been supposed to send that same message to everyone in her site, then go and shimmy, pray too, if one were of such faith. Her desk was too small, too flimsy, too //cheap// to withstand much of anything, how in the hell would an office worker, or the average researcher be able to manage, crawled beneath the folding tables masquerading as high-end workstations? She looked at the email attachment, so close to sending, before again, taking pause to look at it, to fully understand what she&#39;d be sending to everyone who had worked under her.

Fate, in all of her heart and strength, had allowed us to commit our lives to the motto that the Foundation itself was built on,- That we will die in the dark, so that you may prevail in the light. Today, we all will die in the darkness. 

Throughout our existence, we have conquered and contained everything that the world and the worlds beyond had brought to us. Our  containment specialists built nighty cages, our agents extracted abnormalities from far-flung places, were great harm could bring foul to the world and everything in it. 

Our thanks extend to everyone at our foundations, our sites, everyone who had shared the message and belief of living in the darkness for the light of mankind. We are not at liberty to disclose what is to occur-, for we do not fully know, but, what will come, will have us in the bleak light. I ask that everyone at any site, to follow the below instructions, as clearly as possible.

Drop immediately, and cover any exposed flesh with clothing, bandages, or fabric. Be sure to cover the face after finishing reading the full instructions. Immediately drop facedown, shield one&#39;s entire body against anything that will provide substantial coverage, such as a site-desk, vending machine, or terminal. 

Keep eyes closed. Wrap arms tightly across one&#39;s torso, and curl legs tightly forward to your stomach. Stay calm, do not panic. Panicking among onselves will do no such good. Check for injury, making sure that no blood is near, nor any exposed flesh, wounds, or bruises are present. Amputate limbs or body parts possessing such scarring. 

Prepare the Lord&#39;s prayer.

Our Father, which art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy Name;
Thy kingdom come;
Thy will be done
in earth, as it is in heaven:
Give us this day our daily bread;
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive them that trespass against us;
And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil;
For thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory,
For ever and ever.
Amen.

Lois understood the language used. It was both banal and poetic, written like a speech addressed to a crowd after an assassination. It wasn&#39;t far off from the current situation. Lois, as did every member of the council, including whoever or whatever had written the notice couldn&#39;t have believed anything in it. It was all compliance and gentle placebo. As her stomach ached, skin molting, Lois defied orders, and deleted the message. Without much, if any time, Lois sent a new message to everyone, just before entering her buick, crawling into the backseat, with the engine gently running. Before she closed her eyes, she took another look at the message, hopefully content in its message.

**To:** All Site-67 Personal
**From:** Director Calder
**Subject:** SCP-001
[[/div]]
------
To all site personal- I have attached the following file for SCP-001. With everything going on, I want you to know the truth, and you deserve the truth.

**Item No: SCP-001**

**Object Class:** Within Onself

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-001 is self-contained within its object file, and is to be continually contained by reading and acknowledging its object file. 

**Description:** SCP-001 is you, reading this, alongside your life. SCP-001 is everything wonderful in the world, everything that has brought you and your loved ones comfort. 

SCP-001 is the first rain after the long summer, bringing forth great harvests, golden wheat, sweet fruit, and great heaps of vegetables, ready to be eaten for feasts big and small, together with loved ones, sharing blessings and goodwill. Remember those moments, spent together, holding hands, saying grace, eating pie, drinking and being merry.

SCP-001 is the birth of your first child, brought into a world that may have had no place for it, until you had arrived to take care and nurture them, providing everything that they had needed and more then they had wanted. The first day of school, first Christmas, first Easter, first Birthday. Growing together, holding close together. Hold them close.

SCP-001 is your first pet, brought home from the pound, from the farm, from the gentleman down the street, from the little store with the bunnies and kittens. Holding them close on the way home, cuddling or gently patting the box, as the car bumped over hills and holes. You welcomed them into your house, had dealt with the highs and lows, through all the biting and attitude, but being able to hold them at the end of the day, gently petting and scratching behind the ears. They&#39;re either watching above, waiting for you, counting down the days, or here with you now, gently waiting.

SCP-001 is the time spent at the Foundation, keeping the world safe from things originally thought to have been unstoppable. But you, and all of your friends and fellow workers at Site-67 had made sure that everything will be okay. As it always will be. 

SCP-001 is the first instance of kindness shown to you. The moment when someone told that they loved you, that everything will be okay, that everything you&#39;ve done is for good, and all is well, all is quiet, all is lovely, and is all calm.

SCP-001 is you reading this. And for that, I thank you. Spend time together, with everyone you consider loved. Spend time with your pets. Go out and live the world for as long as you can. And when it comes, do not panic. We&#39;ll all be together, so soon. You have all been my favorite memories.
