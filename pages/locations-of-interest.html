The Foundation has identified a number of locations around the world (and beyond it) that are actively anomalous and support permanent communities. While these places would generally be given an SCP designation and evacuated, in some cases this is not possible, due to practical or political constraints. Although not all Locations of Interest are fully controlled by the Foundation,  containment measures are in place to ensure that the general public remains unaware of their existence or anomalous nature.

An inhabited anomalous location designated as a Nexus permits residents to remain within it, under the supervision of the Foundation or another Group of Interest, since the anomalous properties of a Nexus generally cannot extend beyond its borders. Additionally, the Foundation has accepted the existence of a number of Free Ports, paranormal enclaves accessible only through anomalous means, within which the concealment and containment of anomalies is unnecessary. These communities are usually self-managed, with observation from the Foundation and local governments to ensure that anomalous phenomena remain within the Free Port.

+ Nexus Area Classes 

As shown on the map above, anomalous locations are given one of the following classifications, based on how obvious their anomalous properties are and how likely civilians from outside the Nexus are to encounter them. For more information on Nexus definitions and properties, see [[[nexus-series| this page]]].

Anomalous activity is an integral part of the town. The Foundation must regularly perform cover-ups, and takes measures to prevent visitors, such as removing the settlement from maps of the area. Containment Facilities may be required on a case-by-case basis.

A number of other inhabited anomalous locations have come to the attention of the Foundation, but are not currently categorised as a Nexus or Free Port, or may have unusual attributes resulting in a non-standard Nexus Class.

**Area Class:** ##666|**Crossroads**##[[footnote]]Nexus connects to one or more alternate realities.[[/footnote]]

**Description:** A vast extradimensional library, allegedly containing all knowledge ever written down and yet to be created. Although the Foundation has been aware of the Library since 1955, it has existed for much longer than that. The Library serves as the base of operations for GoI-014 (&#34;[[[serpent-s-hand-hub|Serpent&#39;s Hand]]]&#34;), but various inhuman entities known as Librarians are the ones that actually maintain and protect the Nexus. Individuals that harm the Library, its books, or its patrons are punished by being transformed into one of these Librarians to work off their debt. This fate has befallen a number of Foundation personnel during incursions into the Library, and so the Foundation has adopted a more diplomatic approach to this specific location.

**Area Class:** ##FFDD00|**Camelot**##

**Location:** Irish Sea (Formerly)

**Containment Facility:** [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-12|Site-12]]]

**Description:** An island located in an extradimensional space accessible only to those subject to oneirological [[[SCP-6916|triggers]]],  Nx-02 is populated by an unknown number of spectral entities. Currently, due to growing animosity between the Foundation and the ruler of Nexus, the Foundation&#39;s access to the space has been revoked. Initially believed to have been created and governed by the Fae, recent evidence suggests the Nexus was actually part of a large techno-magocracy, tribal human government, known as the Mabyn. At some point, during the Roman invasion of Britain, the Mabyn government collapsed for an unknown reason. During this collapse, Nx-02&#39;s control was taken by the Fae and removed from baseline reality.

**Location:** 100 km west of Ireland

**Containment Facility**: Site-03

**Description:** A magical island in the Atlantic Ocean, accessible through non-anomalous means only one day every seven years. The Nexus is governed by the Tuatha Dé Danann, and acted as a neutral ground for many GoI to operate in, including the Foundation. Devastated following the arrival of [[[lte-0851-cetus | LTE-0851-Cetus]]], the Nexus remains, but is significantly diminished in power, strength, and population.

**Description:** Subterranean ecosystem located at least 40 km beneath South America, inhabited by large intelligent rodents of the Rattus abissos species. These rodents rely on their skill at biothaumaturgy and paraminerology for survival. Site-14 maintains a diplomatic relationship with these non-human inhabitants of the Nexus, prevents exploration by other groups, and cooperates to contain entities found deeper within the Abyss. Due to its depth, no further containment is required.

**Description:** Named after the town&#39;s founder, Jackson Sloth, Sloth&#39;s Pit is a Nexus driven by its own narrative force. Many anomalies are associated with the town, with some still unaccounted for. Known anomalies include gravity reversal in Main Street every Tuesday at 12:00 PM., a colony of sentient, talking praying mantises, and individuals meeting misfortune upon saying the phrase &#34;What could possibly go wrong?&#34; or variants of it. Many Unclassed Anomalous Entities (UAEs) have emerged from the narrative force of Sloth&#39;s Pit, including The Goatman, Sinning Jessie, and the Hook Handed Man. Despite its often goofy and friendly appearance, Sloth&#39;s Pit has also been host to multiple terrifying incidents and has its own dark history.

Notably, these emotions are temporarily diminished when inside the city&#39;s various casinos, although whether this is an anomalous phenomenon or a natural reaction is a matter of debate.

**Description:** A city-state located in its own pocket universe, with connections to the Isle of Portland in the United Kingdom and the cities of Portland in Oregon and Maine, Three Portlands is the largest free port in North America. A haven for anartists, occultists, and parahumans, it has a population of at least 80,000. Foundation operations within the city are prevented or seriously limited by the Hoover Mandate of the United States government. Under the terms of this policy, the United States guarantees the city&#39;s independence and status as a Free Port, while assuming responsibility for its security and secrecy; execution of these duties falls to the [[[unusual-incidents-unit-hub| Unusual Incidents Unit]]], which shares law enforcement jurisdiction with the local police.

**Description:** Little Havana (La Pequeña Habana), also known as &#34;Habanita,&#34; &#34;She Who Has Freedom (SWHP),&#34; or &#34;Habanados,&#34; is an independent city-state and paranormal enclave, located in a self-contained pocket universe accessible through Ways located in and around southern Florida and the Caribbean islands. The town was run by the [[[chicago-spirit|Chicago Rum Runners]]] until 1982, and the anomalous crime syndicate maintains a presence to this day. Little Havana is the largest paranormal enclave in the Caribbean, containing two universities as well as the Royal Palm Hotel run by [[[marshall-carter-and-dark-hub| Marshall, Carter &amp; Dark]]]. Due to tensions with the Cuban government, the Foundation has been unable to get the inhabitants of the Nexus to sign the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/i-57-hub Treaty on Free Anomalous Communities].

**Accessible From:** Berlin, Germany

**Description:** As an extradimensional extension of the borough of Lichtenberg, Outer Lichtenberg is an unstable and inconsistent arrangement of apartments, factories, streets, and courtyards. Although known to both the Nazi Obskurrakorps and the paranatural wing of the Stasi, neither organisation was able to exert control over the area, and Outer Lichtenberg has remained a haven for political dissidents and anarchists. The population is loosely organised into several independent communes that grow their own food in rooftop gardens, notably including multiple members of the anartist collective [[[are-we-cool-yet-hub|Sind Wir Jetzt Cool]]].

**Description:** Paramax is a maximum security prison for paranormal criminals. Although built with Foundation and Global Occult Coalition assistance, it is operated as a United States Penitentiary by the FBI&#39;s [[[unusual-incidents-unit-hub|Unusual Incidents Unit]]], holding paracriminals from across North America for the duration of their sentences. The prison was built on a slab of granite suspended in an artificial orphan universe half a mile in diameter,  and is only accessible by temporary ways created using thaumatology. Through the use of reality anchors, anti-occult sigils and psionic dampeners, the prison can contain the majority of humanoid anomalies, with specialized countermeasures enabling the maximum security wing to hold even the most powerful mages, reality benders and demigods. No prisoner has ever successfully escaped from Paramax.

**Accessible From:** Iwate Prefecture, Japan

**Description:** An extradimensional space accessible from the Kitakami Mountains on the outskirts of Tōno City, inhabited by anomalous entities commonly referred to as &#34;Yōkai&#34;, in addition to a small number of humans and people of mixed-blood. The area is known as Samuto-gou, and has been inhabited since ancient times by beings believed to be divine by their worshippers. The land is surrounded by freshwater, with a central mountain known as Mt. Kakura. It is mostly rural, although there is some modern technology imported by residents, including devices powered by anomalous means. The largest settlement is Samuto, located in the east and consisting of the more urbanised Kami-Samuto district and the more rural Shimo-Samuto. The mountainous northern region of On-ga-dake has unpredictable anomalous weather patterns, while the southwestern area connects with a metaphysical region called &#34;Ihatov&#34;, an area so unstable that even local residents cannot forecast its phenomena.

**Location:** Las Vegas, Nevada, USA; The Fourth Circle of Hell

**Containment Facility:** [[[secure-facilities-locations|Site-666]]]

**Description:** [[[SCP-4661]]] is a region of space in which the city of Las Vegas overlaps with the Fourth Circle of Hell, the domain of greed. While the Foundation&#39;s actions in 1992 were able to anchor Las Vegas to baseline reality, Las Vegas and Hell [[[scp-7666|continue to influence each other]]]. This has resulted in a region of the Fourth Circle resembling a distorted and exaggerated version of Las Vegas, and has also enabled a number of Tartarean-class demonic entities to cross over from this demonic metropolis into Las Vegas. These entities are drawn towards and draw power from alcohol use, sexual intercourse, and gambling, and so it has been deemed impossible to fully exclude them from Las Vegas. Instead, containment of Undervegas involves cooperation with and employment of these Tartarean Entities, to ensure that the general public remains unaware of their presence within the city.

For this reason, it has historically been contested by various powers in the Far East, including the Lan-Fang Republic and Colonies of the West, but it is now a Free Port under the control of several GoI.

[[tab About this Page]]
This page compiles a list of settings that have been used within the SCP Universe, places for readers to explore and for writers to utilise in their own work. Note that their coexistence on this page does not mean they necessarily coexist in-universe! Also note that different depictions of a location may differ, there&#39;s nothing incorrect about changing some of the details to better fit the story you intend to tell.

Nexuses were originally defined on the [[[nexus-series|Nexus Hub]]] as a specific type of article format, although over time various locations were added to the page that were described as Nexuses in SCPs and Tales. Free Ports were added later, as another type of anomalous location. When working on this rewrite, we decided to include a number of additional &#34;Locations of Interest&#34; that appeared in multiple articles, but weren&#39;t officially defined as a Nexus or Free Port. Some anomalous locations will be been omitted from the list above - they either don&#39;t have at least 2 appearances in published articles, or they simply haven&#39;t been added to the page yet.

The map is the best representation we can manage of where the Locations shown on it are, or at least where they are accessible from, in the case of locations within pocket dimensions or alternate realities. Although it was created using the same map as the [[[secure-facilities-locations|Facilities page]]], created by [[*user L200]], it was inspired by earlier work by IAmPuzzlr, [https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/pzugc5/another_guide_poster_for_your_rooms_this_time_for/ posted on reddit].

The images used here are a mixture of flags, coats of arms, signs and logos -- anything that can represent a place. Not all locations have one, and people are welcome to create more. Some existed already, while others were created specifically to be included on this page -- feel free to use them elsewhere!
[[/tab]]
[[tab Adding to this Page]]
This collaborative page is open for any site member to edit and add to, but you&#39;re welcome to make suggestions or get feedback on proposed additions in the Discussion. In general, the idea was to be as inclusive as possible within the general scope of &#34;inhabited anomalous location&#34;.

++ Adding New Locations

The first section of this page is for all locations described in a [[[nexus-series|Nexus format]]]. Additional locations that are referred to as a Nexus within an SCP or Tale can be added, as long as they&#39;re given a number and described in sufficient detail to enable their inclusion here. Merely mentioning the name and Nexus number is insufficient, although there is a list of those in the collapsible above. Free Ports don&#39;t have a specified format in exactly the same way, but will generally be treated the same as just another type of Nexus -- if the Free Port number appears in a published article, it can be included in the list.

For Locations of Interest, we&#39;re looking for a minimum of 2 appearances -- otherwise we&#39;d end up listing every SCP with the [/system:page-tags/tag/location location] and [/system:page-tags/tag/city city] tags, and we want to keep the length of this page manageable. To count as an appearance, we&#39;re looking for more than just the mention of the name -- part of the story should focus on or take place in the Location of Interest. Additionally, a Location of Interest must be a place that can actually be visited in-universe, not somewhere that used to exist but no longer does (unless, for example, the ruins of it remain interesting). For an alternate reality to count as a Location of Interest, there will need to be a reliable way for people to travel there, as well as some way of communicating information about it back. 

The list within the collapsible is much more inclusive of any location, from any branch of the SCP Foundation, even if it&#39;s just mentioned and even if it only appears in untranslated articles. However, for any of these to be added to the main list, we&#39;re going to need a decent description of the place, and at least one appearance in an article in English (translations posted on the International Translation archive count for inclusion on this list).

++ Adding to the Map
If a Location is added to this list, it can also be added to the map, to indicate the general area it&#39;s located in or accessible from. Instructions for doing this can be found on the [[[fragment:locations-map|page where the map is hosted]]].

++ Adding New Images
New images to represent specific locations can be added to the page, but before uploading them it&#39;s best to get feedback from the creator of the location, or at least from someone who&#39;s written articles featuring the location. While there&#39;s flexibility on size since the proportions of these images vary, as a general rule the height should not be more than 150px, and the width should not be more than 200px. To keep things consistent, for flags and other wide images set width=&#34;200px&#34;, while for coats of arms, seals and other round or square logos, set height=&#34;150px&#34;.
