The Foundation has identified a number of locations around the world (and beyond it) that are actively anomalous and support permanent communities. While these places would generally be given an SCP designation and evacuated, in some cases this is not possible, due to practical or political constraints. Although not all Locations of Interest are fully controlled by the Foundation,  containment measures are in place to ensure that the general public remains unaware of their existence or anomalous nature.

An inhabited anomalous location designated as a Nexus permits residents to remain within it, under the supervision of the Foundation or another Group of Interest, since the anomalous properties of a Nexus generally cannot extend beyond its borders. Additionally, the Foundation has accepted the existence of a number of Free Ports, paranormal enclaves and other locations accessible only through anomalous means and non-anomalous means, within which the concealment and containment of anomalies is unnecessary. These communities are usually self-managed, with observation from the Foundation and local governments to ensure that anomalous phenomena remain within the Free Port. A number of additional Locations of Interest are known to the Foundation at this time, ranging in scale from small towns to entire countries, and the category even includes several alternate realties accessible from our own.

**Description:** &#34;Nexus-00&#34; designates consensus reality: all that which is observably, measurably extant and compatible with our universe. This includes any other extrauniversal space which is tethered to, or interfaces with, our reality in a coherent fashion. Any region which can successfully be referenced within consensus reality is, itself, an extension of consensus reality, and therefore comprises Nexus-00. Nexus-00 is of course not a single contiguous, continuous physical surface. It incorporates various physically-disconnected locales which are at least informationally-adjacent to consensus reality. However, it has been evidenced to Our Foundation that the manifold of our local universe (Nexus-00-A) also possesses points and/or boundaries of informational discontinuity. These discontinuities are not to be confused with embedded pocket-universes (ie. a black hole&#39;s interior), nor [*/scp-3930 regions of non-existence], nor extreme antimemetic influence, nor local breakdown of conventional physics, nor **##green|hazardous nomenclative influence##**; all such regions can still be referenced, however circuitously, within the manifold of Nexus-00.

**Area Class:** ##666|**Crossroads**##

**Accessible From:** Baseline, Multiverse

**Description:** Also known as Great Library Yggdrasil or The Nexus of Worlds. A vast and a near-endless extradimensional library, allegedly containing and catalogs all knowledge and information ever written down, as well as many books that cannot be found anywhere else. Although the Foundation has been aware of the Library since 1955, it has existed for much longer than that. It also functions as one of the multiversal nexus. The Library connects to multiple universes, and serves as the base of operations for GoI-014 (&#34;[[[serpent-s-hand-hub|Serpent&#39;s Hand]]]&#34;). The Library is headed by [[[personnel-and-character-dossier|the Serpent of knowledge]]] and managed by various inhuman entities known as [[[wanderers-library-hub|Librarians]]] are the ones that actually maintain and protect the Nexus and many more entities. Individuals that harm the Library, its books, or its patrons are punished by transformation into one of these Librarians, serving the Library until they work off their debt. This has been the fate of a number of Foundation personnel during incursions into the Library, and so the Foundation has adopted a more diplomatic approach to this specific location. The Library itself is also connected to other anomalous libraries such as [[[SCP-1726]]] and [[[SCP-4001]]] and others.

**Description:** Also know as Tír na nÓg by the Tuatha Dé Danann (Homo sapiens tumuli), Avalon by the Ellyllon aka Fae (Homo Sapiens Sidhe) and Annwn by the Mabyn. An island located in an extradimensional space accessible only to those subject to oneirological [[[SCP-6916|triggers]]], Nx-02 is populated by an unknown number of spectral entities. Currently, due to growing animosity between the Foundation and the ruler of Nexus, the Foundation&#39;s access to the space has been revoked. Initially believed to have been created and governed by the Fae, recent evidence suggests the Nexus was actually part of a large techno-magocracy, tribal human government, known as the Mabyn. At some point, during the Roman invasion of Britain, the Mabyn government collapsed for an unknown reason. During this collapse, Nx-02&#39;s control was taken by the Fae and removed from baseline reality.

**Description:** One of the Five Fae Kingdoms. A magical island and nation-state and city in the Atlantic Ocean, also an enclave, accessible through non-anomalous means only one day every seven years. The Nexus is governed by the Tuatha Dé Danann (Homo sapiens tumuli), an anomalous hominid subspecies native to the island, and acted as a neutral ground for many GoI to operate in, including the Foundation. It&#39;s also knows that The Kingdom of Hy-Brasil is a member of the Council of 108 of the [[[goc-hub-page| Global Occult Coalition]]]. Devastated following the arrival of [[[lte-0851-cetus | LTE-0851-Cetus]]], in the year 1988. And the actions of the GOC using using a Nuclear Weapon. This led to mass migration and much of its surviving population undertaking an exodus to other Free Ports and Enclaves such as Three Portlands or Backdoor SoHo including Esterberg and others. Especially due to the death of High King Nuada Airgetlám VII and Crown Princess Mór-Ríoghain and the political turmoil that followed. The Nexus remains, significantly diminished in power, strength, and population, although there are plans for its reconstruction are underway.

The Nexus itself is a small valley that used to serve as the base of a once prosperous Taoist sect known as the Beidi, who built numerous structures within the Nexus in an ancient Chinese architectural style. Notably, the sky above the Nexus is filled with glowing cinnabar-colored clouds, and multiple exinct or anomalous altered wildlife have been observed inside.

**Area Class:** ##red|**Dunwich**##

**Accessible from:** Savoy, France (formerly)

**Description:** The Kingdom of Univers&#39;Isle (also known as the Kingdom of Clouds or by the code name Crusoe) is an anomalous civilization. A floating island in an extradimensional reality that otherwise consists of a completely empty sky. The kingdom was founded in the early 18th Century by the inhabitants of Saint-Guérin in Savoy, France, who travelled through cracks in the sky to colonise the landmass. The intervention of the Catholic Church stranded them there, causing the isolated society to develop their own identity as &#34;Isleans&#34;. Their paratechnology eventually enabled them create interdimensional portals, resuming contact with the baseline universe, although there is tension between factions that wish for peace, and others that believe that the &#34;Worldians&#34; should be conquered. The Foundation is collaborating with peace-seeking Unislist factions (Desilists) to prevent conflict and ensure the existence of The Kingdom of Univers&#39;Isle remains concealed.

**Description:** Subterranean ecosystem located at least 40 km beneath South America, inhabited by large intelligent rodents of the Rattus abissos species. These rodents rely on their skill at biothaumaturgy and paraminerology for survival. Site-14 maintains a diplomatic relationship with these non-human inhabitants of the Nexus, prevents exploration by other groups, and cooperates to contain entities found deeper within the Abyss. Due to its depth, no further containment is required.

**Description:** Named after the town&#39;s founder, Jackson Sloth, Sloth&#39;s Pit is a Nexus driven by its own narrative force. Many anomalies are associated with the town, with some still unaccounted for. Known anomalies include gravity reversal in Main Street every Tuesday at 12:00 PM., a colony of sentient, talking praying mantises, and individuals meeting misfortune upon saying the phrase &#34;What could possibly go wrong?&#34; or variants of it. Many Unclassed Anomalous Entities (UAEs) have emerged from the narrative force of Sloth&#39;s Pit, including The Goatman, Sinning Jessie, and the Hook Handed Man. Despite its often goofy and friendly appearance, Sloth&#39;s Pit has also been host to multiple terrifying incidents and has its own dark history.

**Description:** Nx-94 designates not a single contiguous area, but instead a series of First Nations reserves along the coast of Lake Huron where culturally-specific anomalous occurrences are common. As these occurrences typically only involve members of the related cultures, and as local populations are low, only nominal monitoring activities organized at Site-43 have been necessary thus far.

**Area Class:** ##purple|**Free Port**##

**Accessible From:** Hong Kong, China

**Description:** The Kowloon Walled City was an ungoverned enclave in Hong Kong that fell to the triads and crime, becoming a behemoth place. Prior to its recovery by the Foundation,  [[[SCP-184]]] was utilised by an unknown party to significantly expand the internal space of buildings within the city. Although these regions were thought to have been destroyed by the demolition of the city in 1994, it appears that significant portions of it survived within a pocket dimension. Eventually, Kowloon fell, but not before the many crime syndicates within its walls decided to keep the place. The extradimensional space, a labyrinth of interconnected rooms, corrridors and stairwells, has reportedly been divided into 12 districts, each controlled by a crime syndicate. The Foundation and [[[goc-hub-page| Global Occult Coalition]]] are currently working on finding a way into the paranormal enclave, although all attempts so far have failed.

**Description:** Named after and accessible from the former Dutch colony in south Manhattan, New Amsterdam is an artificial pocket universe and paranormal enclave established during the Paranormal Renaissance. Created under contract for a group of wealthy New York industrialists and socialites, New Amsterdam was originally founded as a tax haven. While it has since been brought under American jurisdiction by the [[[unusual-incidents-unit-hub| Hoover Mandate]]], New Amsterdam continues to function as an exclusive community for extremely wealthy individuals behind the Veil.

The main New York offices of [[[marshall-carter-and-dark-hub| Marshall, Carter &amp; Dark]]] are located in New Amsterdam, and it is suspected that at least one [[[o5-command-dossier|Foundation Overseer]]] maintains a residence in the enclave.

**Location:** Northern Urals, Western Siberia, Russia (Formerly)

**Description:** Adytum[[footnote]] Greek transliteration of the [[[old-adytite-language|Adytite term]]] //Adí-üm//. Not to be confused with adytum, meaning innermost sanctuary.[[/footnote]] was the capital of the ancient //Kalmaktama// Empire (Adi-um Empire), and is believed to have been located in Western Siberia, now part of Russia. The empire was established in 1,800 BCE by a successful rebellion against the [[[daevite-hub|Daevite]]] civilization lead by a man known as Grand Karcist Ion. For the next 800 years the city flourished as the center of a new civilisation, with grand structures built from organic material through the practice of carnomancy. However, after an ancient [[[scp-2406|Occult War]]] between the //Kalmaktama// Empire and various Mediterranean states, incuding the [[[church-of-the-broken-god-hub|Mekhanites]]], Adytum disappeared from the baseline reality along with Grand Karcist Ion, resulting in the collapse of the //Kalmaktama// civilization and the dispersal of a Sarkic diaspora throughout the world.

The current location and status of Adytum are unclear. Minimal archeological evidence for its existence has been found, although given the organic nature of Sarkic structures and tools, this is not unexpected. Various Sarkic sects believe that Adytum still exists somewhere in the void outside the universe, and some accounts suggest it may still be accessible. Multiple Proto-Sarkic sources claim that the city was deliberately removed from baseline reality, although it is unclear if this was intended to protect the city from invaders, or to prevent something within the city from entering into our reality. Several in order Neo-Sarkic sects are actively working toward the rediscovery and [[[scp-2480|return of Adytum]]], an event that would represent a severe disruption to normalcy, and is to be prevented at all costs.

**Description:** The Confederate Island Countries of Phantom (CICP) is a federated nation of islands that exist in a different world. The member islands existed in our world until around the 14th to the 16th century, but relocated through anomalous means to another world, in part to avoid investigation and colonization by the great powers of the time. This resulted in the disappearance of a number of so-called &#34;phantom island&#34;, previously documented on nautical charts but unable to be relocated by later expeditions. In the world of the CICP, there are a group of unusual items called &#34;relics&#34;, and especially powerful items are called with the initials of T or 丁 and are used for the defense of the member islands. The movement of the member islands out of this world was also made possible by relics, said to have been given by a paranormal civilization known as Thule. Thule is said to have disappeared after the formation of the CICP, and no details of it are known to the inhabitants of the member islands. Travel between our reality and the world of the CICP remains possible, and has been the source of a number of anomalies, some of them dangerous and destructive.

**Accessible From:** Kyoto Prefecture, Japan, Asia

**Description:** Drunkness Street (酩酊街), probably referring to a large residential district, is the source of multiple anomalies contained and documented by the Foundation, and appears to be some sort of extradimensional location or parallel universe, associated in some way with Drunkenness, Oblivion and Stagnation. It is primarily (but not exclusively) accessible from Kyoto Prefecture in Japan, but little else is known about the location at this time. Although Drunkness Street does have sapient inhabitants, it is unknown whether they are aware of the Foundation. After the loss of multiple D-Class personel, any further attempt to access Drunkness Street have been prohibited.

**Description:** Farpoint Forward Operating Base is the [[[goc-hub-page| Global Occult Coalition&#39;s]]] most remote outpost. Accessible only through thaumatological apportation, and inhabited and maintained by only a dozen GOC operatives, Farpoint Station is used by the GOC to contain anomalous entities that they cannot liquidate. Farpoint Station may also be utilised for the resupply of extrasolar missions, although such ventures are not currently possible with non-anomalous technology.

**Description:** Hong Shing is located in a pocket dimension that connects the city of Hong Kong to Hong Gong, its counterpart in a parallel universe. Hong Shing duplicates the geography of the Hong Kong peninsula and islands, but is surrounded by an impassable barrier, notably used as a canvas by local anartists known as &#34;Sky Wall Painters.&#34; Hong Shing is monitored by governments and normalcy organisations from both universes, and the Foundation has established a working relationship with its counterpart from the Right Phase, an organisation known as the Zhujihui. Hong Shing is regarded as neutral space between worlds, giving it a high level of autonomy and allowing the city to serve as a hub for cross-cultural exchange, paratechnology, and thaumaturgy.

The majority of these tunnels are of uniform appearance, passing through smooth dirt, although other appearances have been observed. Entry through a doorway connected to the network can be facilitated by physical contact with at least 7 grams of biological material from a member of the genus Gallus (Chicken), or local equivalent. Exploration is ongoing, including the establishment of outposts for resupply and diplomatic relations, but is complicated by the fact that many doorways connect to the [#wanderers-library Wanderer&#39;s Library].

Although harmless at times corresponding to the original store&#39;s opening hours, these entities exhibit violent hostility during periods when the store would be closed. The Foundation prevents further entry and amnesticises any individual that manages to leave, although escape is infrequent due to the labyrinthine layout of the extradimensional store.

**Description:** Mu Yi is a private library and museum set up in 1994. Its collections are mainly anomalous antiques and books. It does not open to the outside world, and appointments are required to view items or borrow books. It was discovered by the Foundation during ██ event in 1978, and there has been a relationship between the two organizations since then. With the Foundation&#39;s assistance, Mu Yi Private Library And Museum has set up a branch in Hong Kong. In return, Mu Yi Private Library And Museum purchases and gathers anomalous collections on behalf of the Foundation, blocking the items from being transferred elsewhere. In addition, the group currently cooperates with the Foundation&#39;s Department of Archaeology, in research studying history and in excavations relating to anomalies.

The Contract of Manuscript may be adjusted anytime, as a response to any gray area or based on the Foundation&#39;s new policy.

**Description:** Also known as USP Paranormal ADMAX or simply Paranormal ADX. Paramax is a maximum security prison for paranormal criminals. Although built with Foundation and Global Occult Coalition assistance, it is operated as a United States Penitentiary by the FBI&#39;s [[[unusual-incidents-unit-hub|Unusual Incidents Unit]]], holding paracriminals from across North America for the duration of their sentences. The prison was built on a slab of granite suspended in an artificial orphan universe half a mile in diameter,  and is only accessible by temporary ways created using thaumatology. Through the use of reality anchors, anti-occult sigils and psionic dampeners, the prison can contain the majority of humanoid anomalies, with specialized countermeasures enabling the maximum security wing to hold even the most powerful mages, reality benders and demigods. Although many attempts have been made, no prisoner has ever successfully escaped from Paramax.

**Description:** [[[SCP-4661]]] is a region of space in which the city of Las Vegas overlaps with the Fourth Circle of Hell, the domain of greed and the biggest demonic Nexus, in the western hemisphere, also a demon enclave. While the Foundation&#39;s actions in 1992 were able to anchor Las Vegas to baseline reality, Las Vegas and Hell [[[scp-7666|continue to influence each other]]]. This has resulted in a region of the Fourth Circle resembling a distorted and exaggerated version of Las Vegas, and has also enabled a number of Tartarean-class demonic entities to cross over from this demonic metropolis into Las Vegas. These entities are drawn towards and draw power from alcohol use, sexual intercourse, and gambling, and so it has been deemed impossible to fully exclude them from Las Vegas. Instead, containment of Undervegas involves cooperation with and employment of these Tartarean Entities, to ensure that the general public remains unaware of their presence within the city.

**Description:** The Violet is one of six large extradimensional clusters, first confirmed in 2020 ,where organisms similar to Earth&#39;s crustaceans, annelids, and nematodes live. The extradimensional clusters, the precursor of The Violet, tend to attract other dimensions with similar laws of physics, lifeforms, and other traits. While an extradimensional cluster was pulling the baseline towards itself, The Violet was separated from the cluster and was shattered. Being fragmented into a few thousand shards, The Violet started to merge with the baseline, costing the Foundation many resources. The Violet has no current line of command or social structure but attempts to invade our baseline by sheer population and replace their dead dimension with ours. The Violet&#39;s only and fundamental purpose is their survival. Some pursue this goal by coexisting with baseline creatures, but others try to eliminate all local species and take their place. Their targets include the SCP Foundation. Hence, contact with The Violet organisms requires particular caution.

**Location:** Yellow Sea, East Asia

**Description:** The Republic of West Korea is a nation formerly situated on a landmass in the Yellow Sea, west of (and possibly connected to) the Korean peninsula. Following an engineered reality-altering event, the entirety of the country and its geographical boundaries were displaced from consensus reality, leaving behind only [[[SCP-5345]]]. Analysis of documents recovered from SCP-5345 corroborate the existence of a competent national normalcy organization, the West Korean Ministry of Abnormal Affairs, which was primarily responsible for the nation&#39;s disappearance.

While it is possible to access the Republic of West Korea by traversing to its current plane of existence -- believed to be one of many potential afterlives -- or [[[SCP-7722|vice versa]]], the presence of unidentified hostile entities haunting the nation&#39;s extraplanar territory have prompted the Foundation&#39;s current policy of non-invasive monitoring. There are currently no proposals to make contact with, or restore the Republic of West Korea to baseline reality.

[[tab About this Page]]
This page compiles a list of settings that have been used within the SCP Universe, places for readers to explore and for writers to utilise in their own work. Note that their coexistence on this page does not mean they necessarily coexist in-universe! Also note that different depictions of a location may differ, there&#39;s nothing incorrect about changing some of the details to better fit the story you intend to tell.

Nexuses were originally defined on the [[[nexus-series|Nexus Hub]]] as a specific type of article format, although over time various locations were added to the page that were described as Nexuses in SCPs and Tales. Free Ports were added later, as another type of anomalous location. When working on this rewrite, we decided to include a number of additional &#34;Locations of Interest&#34; that appeared in multiple articles, but weren&#39;t officially defined as a Nexus or Free Port, and while creating this page we&#39;ve avoided refering to them as such in the absence of an official classification in a published article. Some anomalous locations will be been omitted from the list above - they either don&#39;t have at least 2 appearances in published articles, or they simply haven&#39;t been added to the page yet.

The map is the best representation we can manage of where the Locations shown on it are, or at least where they are accessible from, in the case of locations within pocket dimensions or alternate realities. Although it was created using the same map as the [[[secure-facilities-locations|Facilities page]]], created by [[*user L200]], it was inspired by earlier work by IAmPuzzlr, [https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/pzugc5/another_guide_poster_for_your_rooms_this_time_for/ posted on reddit].

The images used here are a mixture of flags, coats of arms, signs and logos -- anything that can represent a place. Not all locations have one, and people are welcome to create more. Some existed already, while others were created specifically to be included on this page -- feel free to use them elsewhere!
[[/tab]]
[[tab Adding to this Page]]
This collaborative page is open for any site member to edit and add to, but you&#39;re welcome to make suggestions or get feedback on proposed additions in the Discussion. In general, the idea was to be as inclusive as possible within the general scope of &#34;inhabited anomalous location&#34;.

This page is the responsibility of the [http://05command.wikidot.com/curation-main Curation Team]. If you have any questions or suggestions, you can contact us via the #help-desk channel on the [https://discord.com/invite/scp SCP Wiki Official Discord server], or via [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/chat-guide IRC chat #site17], or by messaging a member of the Collaboration Pages subteam. 

++ Adding New Locations

The first section of this page is for all locations described in a [[[nexus-series|Nexus format]]]. Additional locations that are referred to as a Nexus within an SCP or Tale can be added, as long as they&#39;re given a number and described in sufficient detail to enable their inclusion here. Merely mentioning the name and Nexus number is insufficient, although there is a list of those in the collapsible above. International articles using a non-standard format will be added to the list at the appropriate place numerically if articles are translated, treating Nx-CN-08 as equivalent to Nx-08.

Free Ports don&#39;t have a specified format in exactly the same way, but will generally be treated the same as just another type of Nexus -- if the Free Port number appears in a published article, it can be included in the list.

For Locations of Interest, we&#39;re looking for a minimum of 2 appearances -- otherwise we&#39;d end up listing every SCP with the [/system:page-tags/tag/location location] and [/system:page-tags/tag/city city] tags, and we want to keep the length of this page manageable. To count as an appearance, we&#39;re looking for more than just the mention of the name -- part of the story should focus on or take place in the Location of Interest. Additionally, a Location of Interest must be a place that can actually be visited in-universe, not somewhere that used to exist but no longer does (unless, for example, the ruins of it remain interesting). For an alternate reality to count as a Location of Interest, there will need to be a reliable way for people to travel there, as well as some way of communicating information about it back.

++ Adding to the Map
If a Location is added to this list, it can also be added to the map, to indicate the general area it&#39;s located in or accessible from. Instructions for doing this can be found on the [[[fragment:locations-map|page where the map is hosted]]].

++ Adding New Images
New images to represent specific locations can be added to the page, but before uploading them it&#39;s best to get feedback from the creator of the location, or at least from someone who&#39;s written articles featuring the location. While there&#39;s flexibility on size since the proportions of these images vary, as a general rule the height should not be more than 150px, and the width should not be more than 200px. To keep things consistent, for flags and other wide images set width=&#34;200px&#34;, while for coats of arms, seals and other round or square logos, set height=&#34;150px&#34;.
