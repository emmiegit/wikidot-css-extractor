**Item #:** SCP-6778

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Mobile Task Force Zeta-28 (&#39;Dreamwalkers&#39;) have been tasked with monitoring the stability of coma patients worldwide to determine the frequency of SCP-6778 sightings. Verified witnesses should be transported to the nearest Foundation facility for interviewing purposes, before being administered Class-A amnestics and released for further medical treatment.

**Description:** SCP-6778 is a metaphysical space accessible to coma patients. All testimony of SCP-6778 originates from persons who experienced a state of prolonged unconsciousness (either natural or medically-induced) for a duration of no less than one year. It is currently unknown what percentage of coma patients will experience SCP-6778. 

Some minor discrepancies aside, descriptions of SCP-6778 have remained universally consistent since reports first surfaced. SCP-6778 is reminiscent of a late-nineteenth century American saloon, situated in a vast desert landscape where the sun is perpetually at the horizon.

Witnesses generally identify SCP-6778 by the name of //The Seven Sleepers&#39; Tavern//, or some variation thereof. Whilst in this state, the subject will possess little memory of their previous existence (usually only recalling their first name), and have no awareness of the passage of time[[footnote]]Most witnesses are unable to recall how much time they spent in SCP-6778, with usually estimating a duration of anything from a few hours to several years.[[/footnote]].

Aside from food and alcohol service, SCP-6778 features live entertainment such as music, singing and line dancing. Notably, the appearance of SCP-6778 bar staff and performers seems to vary depending on the observer, usually taking the form of close friends or past romantic partners.

SCP-6778-A designates a humanoid entity which exists in SCP-6778. SCP-6778-A (referred to variously as &#39;Mr. Suit&#39;, &#39;Mr. Cards&#39; or &#39;Mr. King&#39;) is described as a tall man dressed in a dark overcoat, with a wide-brimmed hat obscuring the top portion of its face.

Unlike other patrons, SCP-6778-A has never been observed eating, drinking or dancing, instead remaining sat in the same position at all times, with a set of playing cards laid before it. It is not believed that subjects feel any compulsion to approach SCP-6778-A, but may do so willingly.

Should the subject ask SCP-6778-A to partake in a game of poker, SCP-6778-A will agree. At this point, all in-house entertainment will halt, and a crowd of patrons will gather to observe. Upon completion, regardless of the game&#39;s outcome, the subject will bid farewell to their fellow patrons, before drinking one last glass of ale and departing through one of SCP-6778&#39;s two exits. SCP-6778-A will then reshuffle its cards before returning to its inert state.

As of 2023 there are 29 documented reports of SCP-6778 from coma patients in 11 countries worldwide. Of these cases, all have recounted playing poker with SCP-6778-A, and all have reported winning.
