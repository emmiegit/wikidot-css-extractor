**Item #:** SCP-7097

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7097 is to be contained within a 10x15 meter isolation chamber in Site 15. Access to the containment cell should be granted only for testing purposes and only to approved personnel the subject &#39;trusts&#39;, an approved research assistant is also to accompany any personnel entering the cell. During every experiment, SCP-7097 is to be monitored with biofeedback monitors at all times. Any personnel entering SCP-7097&#39;s cell is to wear a full set of NIOSH approved PPE equipment, such as a respirator, gloves, splash resistant suit, etc.


**Description:** SCP-7097 is a 38 year old Caucasian male of average height and weight. SCP-7097 appears to have a degenerative disorder of unknown etiology, as well as an unusual physical manifestation. SCP-7097&#39;s head appears to be normal, but the lower portions of his body exhibit signs of progressive degeneration. SCP-7097&#39;s arms and legs have developed into sagging appendages, composed mostly of cartilage and skin. The flesh is grey in colour and can no longer be considered viable, and appears to be starting to disintegrate. His spinal cord, brain and heart appear to have shrivelled to the point that no vascular or neural vessels remain, it is unknown how the subject is still alive without a proper circulatory system. SCP-7097&#39;s remaining organs consist of eyes, a mouth, an external genitalia, and a set of digits in the form of an opposable thumb. 

SCP-7097&#39;s condition is highly contagious, and all members of a crowd from any species can become infected upon contact with his sagging extremities. SCP-7097&#39;s condition begins to take effect on subjects exposed within approximately 15 minutes, with the more severe cases beginning between 5 and 10 minutes.

SCP-7097&#39;s reaction to human interaction and society are entirely consistent with the medical model of rabies, though the idea that the subject has contracted an evolved form of rabies has been ruled out. SCP-7097&#39;s behaviour is erratic, and has taken on several extreme states. In typical cases, SCP-7097 becomes reclusive and will attempt to hide from large groups of people. In severe cases, especially when interacting with unapproved personnel, SCP-7097 will attempt to flee or destroy anything in his path. SCP-7097 appears to have lost his ability of coherent speech, and any attempts to interview SCP-7097 have ultimately resulted in little to no response.

**Addendum-7097-01:** In 2009, it was discovered after rigorous testing that given the increasing degradation of SCP-7097&#39;s condition, it is currently believed that SCP-7097-1 is a spontaneously evolving biological entity.
