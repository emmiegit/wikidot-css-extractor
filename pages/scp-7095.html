**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7095 is currently contained within it&#39;s own dimension. As such, all efforts are focused on preventing instances of SCP-7095-1 from breaching containment and entering baseline reality. Area-95 has been established for this purpose, housing twenty 5m x 5m chambers lined with 2cm thick stainless steel. Each of these chambers must be outfitted with the following:

# one computer terminal with the SCP-7095-DELTA software downloaded on it
# at least two Scranton Reality Anchors[[footnote]]Devices that can stabilize an area of warped reality and nullify the abilities of reality benders, originally designed by Dr. Robert Scranton[[/footnote]]
# at least four security cameras; one for each corner of the chamber 
# one backup generator in the event of a power failure

One specially-trained D-Class subject must be present in each chamber at all times, with two other subjects available for rotation. The SCP-7095-DELTA program on each computer terminal must be operated continuously, as thorough testing has shown that at least sixteen active operators are necessary to maintain a safe level of containment. Should any D-Class subject activate a &#34;Game Over&#34; screen within one of these chambers, an automatic door system will seal the affected area, after which the reality anchors within will activate and terminate any entities that have manifested near the terminal. No attempt to recover any personnel left inside the chamber is to be made until the termination of all SCP-7095-1 instances has been confirmed.

A copy of SCP-7095-DELTA on a thumb drive must be contained off-site as a backup in the event of a catastrophic containment breach in Area-95. All MTF and high level staff on-site are to have modified SCRAMBLE headsets[[footnote]]An improved version of the technology utilized during the containment breach of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-096 SCP-096][[/footnote]] available for use.

**Description:** SCP-7095 is an extradimensional location of indeterminate size, but appears to be labyrinthine in structure. The entirety of SCP-7095 is incomprehensible to human beings, and acts as a very potent cognitohazard. Any attempts to perceive the anomaly in it&#39;s true form have been met with failure. On it&#39;s own, it poses no threat to our universe and is essentially self-contained. 

SCP-7095-1 is the collective designation for the inhabitants of SCP-7095. Like the location itself, these entities cannot be perceived by human beings. Most humans that have been exposed to visual or auditory stimuli produced by the entities are unable to recall any details about them, while also suffering various psychological effects[[footnote]]These effects range from severe anxiety and depression to suicidal tendencies[[/footnote]]. Instances recorded on camera feed will appear as formless distortions, with audio feed being similarly unintelligible. 

Despite this, numerous SCP-7095-1 variants have been identified based on their behavioral patterns and how they physically interact with their surroundings (See Addendum 7095-1 for more information). Outside of SCP-7095, these entities have displayed limited reality-bending capabilities that allow them to warp and disfigure any form of biological matter they come into contact with. These abilities can also affect non-biological materials, but to a much lesser extent dependent on the hardness of said materials. The vast majority of instances encountered have displayed either an innate curiosity or hostility towards living organisms in their vicinity, though this distinction can often be difficult to determine due to their anomalous effects.

SCP-7095-DELTA is an anomalous first-person shooter game that was released to the public as //Bad Toys 3D// for the Windows 95 operating system. Despite its title, the game primarily uses pixelated images and sprites, albeit displayed in a traversable three-dimensional environment. The program was originally developed by Tibo Software[[footnote]]A small computer game developer located in Pardubice, Czech Republic[[/footnote]] in 1995 as a black-and-white shooting game simply known as //Bad Toys//, before an updated colorized version of the software was released in 1997. Unlike the original game, this newer version was found to possess anomalous qualities that were carried over to every copy of the software that was downloaded. It was initially believed that SCP-7095-DELTA was an early attempt at a procedurally-generated virtual world, with depicted locations, objects, and entities in the game changing every time it was played. 

Through as of yet unknown means, the SCP-7095-DELTA program is able to act as a sort of &#34;window&#34; into the dimension that makes up SCP-7095. Said program can superimpose the assets, sound effects and textures of the //Bad Toys 3D// game onto the entities and environments of SCP-7095 in real time, allowing them to be artificially perceived through the computer screen it&#39;s being displayed on. This software is functionally similar to a form of augmented reality, allowing players to view all phenomena within SCP-7095 safely. 

When booting up the game, players will be placed within a random location of SCP-7095, while the program overlays the maze-like structure of the dimension with an aesthetic meant to resemble a toy factory. Likewise, all SCP-7095-1 instances encountered are depicted as various antagonistic toy characters, and will change their position according to how the instances move in real time. The program is also capable of directly interacting with and attacking the aforementioned entities, and can likewise be engaged by them. 

As with a standard videogame, SCP-7095-DELTA has a &#34;health&#34; system that, when depleted, results in a &#34;Game Over&#34; image appearing on the screen. However, should any SCP-7095 instances end the game via direct contact with the screen, SCP-7095-DELTA will experience a software crash, followed shortly thereafter by the physical manifestation of the instances in baseline reality. How SCP-7095-DELTA was programmed in this way is currently being investigated, --but its operation has proven to be the only way for SCP-7095-1 instances to gain access to our reality--. See Addendum-7095-3. 

**Addendum-7095-1:**

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Discovery and History&#34; hide=&#34;- hide block&#34;]]

SCP-7095 was originally discovered on 03/10/1997, in the aftermath of an attack by multiple SCP-7095-1 instances at █████████ High School in Stockton, California, where it was found that //Bad Toys 3D// had been downloaded onto one of the school&#39;s computers. The Foundation became aware of anomalous activity within the school after a call to local authorities by one of the students was intercepted. The student had described &#34;impossible things melting through the walls&#34; in the school&#39;s computer sciences building. Upon arrival, Foundation agents recorded a large spike in Hume levels originating from the building, which was believed to be housing an entity capable of distorting local reality.

[[include component:image-block | name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Backup_Backup_Backup_-_And_Test_Restores.jpg | caption=The computer that acted as the origin point for the first SCP-7095-1 manifestation.  | width=30%]]

A group of Foundation agents were sent in to ascertain the threat, but were overwhelmed by multiple SCP-7095-1 instances that were unaffected by conventional firepower. In response, a specialized drone equipped with a Scranton Reality Anchor was deployed in an attempt to disable the reality-bending abilities of the instances. While activation of the anchor was successful, it had the unintended effect of terminating the three SCP-7095-1 instances found in the area, leaving only a translucent, viscous substance coating the room they were in. 

Thorough investigation of the building revealed the origin point of of the SCP-7095-1 manifestation to be the computer that //Bad Toys 3D// had been downloaded on. Though it was heavily damaged by the abilities of the SCP-7095-1 entities, the computer was found to be functional and was subsequently taken into containment. Following this event, an additional █ incidents occurred between the time of discovery and the time that full containment of the anomalous software was achieved. 

At the time, SCP-7095 was believed to be the computer game itself, which lead to a campaign by the Foundation to remove all download links for the game from the internet, as well as track down any civilians who had downloaded the game and deleting the software from their computer systems. A non-anomalous version of the game was also developed and distributed by the Foundation in 1998, reusing about 3% of the assets from the original game. Tibo Software&#39;s website continues to host the updated build to this day, to prevent any suspicion of the previous version being removed from the internet. Further investigation into said company and its employees revealed that the //Bad Toys 3D// software was merely an anomalous tool (reclassified as SCP-7095-DELTA) used to explore the dimension that would ultimately be known as SCP-7095.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Journal Logs of Tereza Rádsetoulal&#34; hide=&#34;- hide block&#34;]]

On 03/13/1997, a raid was conducted by the Foundation on Tibo Software&#39;s headquarters, where it was found to have been abandoned by its employees. The majority of records and archives recovered from the building yielded little information about the anomaly, though agents were able to obtain documents related to an unknown organization called PROJECT DELTA. This group of interest had apparently purchased Tibo Software from its original owners, though no official documentation of this acquisition could be found. 

The Foundation was subsequently able to track down all but one of the missing employees of Tibo Software. Despite working for the company, none of the staff displayed any knowledge of SCP-7095-DELTA or its anomalous functionality. It appears that most of the employees were led to believe that they were working on an updated version of //Bad Toys// before being fired by executives from Project Delta. Tereza Rádsetoulal, one of the art designers at the company, has still not been located. Interviews with her friends and family yielded no information as to her whereabouts, but a journal written by Rádsetoulal was recovered from her residence. The following entries were translated and included in this document due to containing insight on the development of SCP-7095-DELTA.

&gt; **//3. June 1996//**
&gt; 
&gt; //Our team got some amazing news today! The boss said that an agreement has been made to collaborate with Project Delta on our new games! Don&#39;t know much about the company, but Pavel&#39;s mentioned that they have some deep pockets and new technologies to fund bigger and better projects. I can&#39;t wait to see where this takes me in my career! No more puzzle games and cheap Wolfenstein 3D knockoffs, now it&#39;s time to make a name for myself!//

&gt; **//8. June 1996//**
&gt; 
&gt; //I guess I spoke too soon on this, huh? There are some big changes going on in the company that I really don&#39;t like. The boys upstairs fired a couple of our programmers and replaced them with Project Delta employees, which really sucks. I loved working with those two, they did not deserve to be replaced like that.// 
&gt; 
&gt; //The PD guys, yeah, I&#39;m just gonna call them PD. I&#39;m already sick of hearing that name. So the PD guys have taken a particular interest in one of our previous games, Bad Toys. They want us to work on a new colored version of the game with more characters and weapons. They claim their programmers are developing a new engine that will revolutionize the computer game industry, but I have a hard time believing that. I&#39;m sure you can guess who they want to work on all of those new characters I mentioned. This is feeling less like a collaboration and more like a takeover.//

&gt; **//12. July 1996//**
&gt; 
&gt; //It&#39;s been a while since my last entry here. Things have only been getting worse for myself and my colleagues. More firings, of course, and more replacing them with boring PD suits. The Valach brothers left as well. I mean, they were the original guys who came up with Bad Toys in the first place, and now they&#39;re gone. Oh, my buddy Milan is pretty pissed off about it, too. He&#39;s our texture designer, so they at least kept him around. He told me that he left a surprise in the game that the kiddies are gonna LOVE, whatever that means. Hope he doesn&#39;t get himself fired.// 
&gt; 
&gt; //You know, I was ready to get out of there as well, but then they offered me quite the raise. I&#39;m talking life-changing money here! PD really wants to keep me and some of the other artistic types on board for their Bad Toys uuhh, sequel? Remake? I don&#39;t even know what to call it. Well, they&#39;re actually calling it Bad Toys 3D, which doesn&#39;t really make much sense because the original game was already in 3D! But hey, money talks, and perhaps these guys might know what they&#39;re doing.//

&gt; **//22. September 1996//**
&gt; 
&gt; //I&#39;m getting really tired of hearing the name Bad Toys. The Project Delta suits are having me design more and more enemies for the game. Not only that, but they&#39;re requesting specific design choices that I must adhere to for each new toy character. Really weird ones, too. They said one of the enemies absolutely MUST have a giant tongue, and another MUST have a beach ball for a body.// 
&gt; 
&gt; //I mean, I don&#39;t have a problem designing these characters, of course. It&#39;s just weird that this company would make such strict requests for our designs. Feels like the PD guys had the game planned out from the start. And that&#39;s not even the strangest part! On random days, one of the suits will just walk in and bark new orders at us for completely new and strange designs. It&#39;s like the game is getting focus-tested to hell and back, except the focus-testers are a bunch of weirdos.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Aside from that, they&#39;ve also been putting a big emphasis on weapons and items for the enemies to drop. It&#39;s almost like they&#39;re turning Bad Toys into a collect-a-thon instead of a shooting game like it was meant to be! So, maybe they didn&#39;t have it planned from the start and are actually just making it up as they go. Ah, the mystery!//

&gt; **//18. February 1997//**
&gt; 
&gt; //Soooo, the suits FINALLY let me play test the game, and well, it&#39;s definitely Bad Toys but with color. I mean, there&#39;s a lot more stuff in it, but it doesn&#39;t really play much different than the original. Apparently, the levels are randomly generated, but what I played just looked like the same liminal corridors and rooms, just jumbled around each time and with a different coat of pixelated paint. Not sure how I feel about this, to be honest.//
&gt; 
&gt; //I WILL say that it was cool to see my enemy designs in action! But my god did they make them tough. The whole game will turn into a literal bullet hell when there&#39;s only a few of them around! I suppose having the challenge is a good thing, but it will take A LOT of skill to get very far in the game.// 
&gt; 
&gt; //The PD guys said they&#39;re gonna release the game soon, and I&#39;m gonna be looking forward to moving on to something new after this.//

&gt; **//3. March 1997//**
&gt; 
&gt; //Welp, the game was released. Unceremoniously, I might add. Didn&#39;t even tell any of us, no celebration or congratulations from the higher ups, nothing. They just threw it up on our website. I would&#39;ve thought Project Delta could afford a decent ad campaign, but I guess they&#39;re hoping good word of mouth will save them money. I need some sleep...//

&gt; **//11. March 1997//**
&gt; 
&gt; //They fired me! They [EXPLETIVE] fired ME! They got rid of everyone else who was left at Tibo, threw us out like [EXPLETIVE] garbage. It&#39;s not just that, either. The game disappeared from our website. All of our hard work, and nothing to show for it! I know those PD freaks have still been dropping by our building collecting their junk. I&#39;m gonna try following one of them back to their headquarters, give the upper [EXPLETIVE] management a piece of my mind! Figure out what the hell is going on!//
&gt; 
&gt; //If I don&#39;t write anything down after this, it probably means I&#39;m in prison for tearing somebody&#39;s [EXPLETIVE] eyes out!!//

No other journal logs were written after this entry. A search of the Czech Republic prison system for any records of Tereza Rádsetoulal produced no results. Her current whereabouts remain unknown.

To determine the behaviors of different SCP-7095-1 variants, extensive testing in a controlled environment was conducted using D-Class subjects and a copy of the SCP-7095-DELTA software. The following is an abridged log of variants discovered so far, their visual appearance within the program, and their effects on subjects in baseline reality. 

----

||~ Classification ||~ Description ||~ Result ||
|| SCP-7095-1A|| Resembles a yellow, smiling face with hands and feet. Moves faster than most other variants, but is extremely weak and can only attack targets up close. || Instance disfigured the subject&#39;s face by stretching their mouth around their head and significantly increasing the size of their teeth. Subject was noted to be laughing until expiration. ||
|| SCP-7095-1B || Appears to be a dog standing on two legs and wearing police attire. Instance is armed with a Gatling gun. || Subject began violently convulsing, and remained in this state for over seven minutes before expiration. Autopsy of the body revealed that the subject had experienced late stage symptoms of the rabies virus before their death. ||
|| SCP-7095-1G || Visually resembles a demonic bumblebee that hovers in the air. Capable of launching green, spherical projectiles towards its targets. || Subject&#39;s skin melted upon contact with the instance. Expiration of the subject occurred at about three minutes after contact. ||
|| SCP-7095-1M || Instance appears to be an orange turtle with a cannon mounted to its carapace. It uses this weapon to launch explosive projectiles. || Subject&#39;s arms, legs, and head were slowly pulled into their torso, followed by expiration due to severe blood loss. ||
|| SCP-7095-1S || Resembles a spring with a green ball as its head. Armed with a plasma gun and emits a continuous spring noise when moving.|| Subject was partially disfigured by the instance before expiration. Autopsy of the body revealed that the subject&#39;s spine was violently twisted into a shape resembling a corkscrew. ||
|| SCP-7095-1AK || A blue, hovering creature with a large left eye that has a spiraling design. Armed with a revolver. || Subject&#39;s skin turned blue upon contact with the instance. No other changes were observed, and the variant was neutralized without incident. ||
|| SCP-7095-1AA || A smiling humanoid resembling a bubble blower. Instance is able to launch bubble-like projectiles that can ricochet off of walls. || Subject&#39;s body rapidly expanded to five times its original size until [DATA EXPUNGED]. Extensive repairs had to be made to the chamber before testing could resume. No further experiments with this variant are permitted.||
|| SCP-7095-1AF || Appears to be a ghost-like entity with elements of a kite. Carries a lantern that can release projectiles resembling ball lightning. || Upon manifestation, the instance caused the test subject to emit an electromagnetic pulse, instantly killing them and disabling the SRA and camera systems within the chamber. The instance remained inert until the systems could be restored, and was successfully terminated soon after. No further experiments with this variant are permitted.||
|| SCP-7095-1AT || A robotic humanoid that emits a continuous crunching noise when moving. Considered a high-level threat in the game due to it&#39;s immense durability. || Subject&#39;s entire body was transmuted into an unknown metallic compound with an iridescent sheen. Further study revealed that only the subject&#39;s skin was affected by transmutation; all internal organs, skeletal structure and bodily systems were left unchanged. Subject remained conscious but unable to move for seventeen hours until expiration due to brain hemorrhaging. ||
|| SCP-7095-1AU || Appears to be a semi-humanoid creature that hops towards its target by bouncing on its enlarged tongue. Carries a shotgun to attack with. || Instance caused the subject&#39;s tongue to increase in size, while multiple tongue-like appendages began to grow out of all other orifices. Subject expired soon after due to suffocation. ||
|| SCP-7095-1AX || A previously undiscovered variant that rapidly approached the screen without warning. Resembled a grotesque version of SCP-7095-1AK with a distended mouth lined with jagged teeth. || Subject rapidly transformed upon contact with the instance, causing them to grow twelve additional limbs and significantly increasing their body mass. While activation of the SRAs successfully terminated the instance, the transformed subject became extremely hostile and broke out of the test chamber, killing two researchers before being neutralized by Foundation agents. ||

Due to the unpredictable nature of stronger SCP-7095-1 variants, testing is to be discontinued until further notice.

**Addendum-7095-2:**

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Incident-7095-A&#34; hide=&#34;- hide block&#34;]]

On 10/04/1997, a massive surge in Hume levels was detected northeast of Pardubice, where a previously unknown complex was discovered by the Foundation. Believed to be related to SCP-7095, Mobile Task Force Eta-10 (&#34;See No Evil&#34;) was dispatched to investigate the structure and neutralize any SCP-7095-1 instances. Upon arrival, agents found that the facility was in fact the headquarters of Project Delta, the group supposedly responsible for creating SCP-7095-DELTA. The smaller main building was merely a front for the organization under a different name, while the actual complex was located underground.

When entering the lower structure, the MTF encountered eight SCP-7095-1 instances, the largest amount in a single incident to date. The entities had killed the entirety of Project Delta&#39;s staff, leaving behind mangled and deformed corpses, some of which were completely unrecognizable as being human. DNA testing confirmed that one of the bodies belonged to Tereza Rádsetoulal, who had apparently been kept imprisoned in the lower complex for nearly seven months before her death. Further exploration of the complex revealed a variety of anomalous machinery, including a fleet of over one hundred weaponized drones. Documentation collected from the site suggests that the machinery and drones were used for exploration of SCP-7095, though all of the aforementioned systems appeared to have been shut down before the breach of SCP-7095-1 instances had occurred.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Interview Log of Dr. Thomas Sokol&#34; hide=&#34;- hide block&#34;]]

Five days after Incident-7095-1, a civilian with extensive knowledge of both the Foundation and SCP-7095 approached agents stationed at Tibo Software&#39;s headquarters, claiming to be a researcher at Project Delta who escaped the breach. The following interview was conducted with Thomas Sokol, the only known survivor of Project Delta&#39;s staff.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Interviewed:** Dr. Thomas Sokol

**Interviewer:** Dr. ████████████

**Foreword:** This interview is being conducted to corroborate the Foundation&#39;s information of SCP-7095 with that of Thomas Sokol, who claims to have worked for Project Delta.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Dr. ████████████:** Please state your name for the record.

**Thomas Sokol:** I am Dr. Thomas Sokol, lead researcher of Project Delta.

**Dr. ████████████:** Ah yes, Project Delta. Let&#39;s begin with that, shall we? You claim to have been a part of this organization for many years, yet we have only recently become aware of its existence. What exactly was the purpose of Project Delta? 

**Thomas Sokol:** To discover new worlds, and new resources to extract from them. It might sound a bit cruel, but our goal at Project Delta was a truly noble one for humanity. When we discovered what you call SCP-7095, we essentially became pioneers of the unknown. Our team managed to open a window into another world, something that was thought to be impossible! And with a little more time and research, we managed to turn that window into a doorway. Of course, you could imagine our disappointment when we saw nothing but static on the recording equipment we sent in.

**Dr. ████████████:** Right, SCP-7095 cannot be perceived by man or machine- 

**Thomas Sokol:** That&#39;s only half true, as you know by now.

**Dr. ████████████:** Well, yes. With SCP-7095-DELTA, this computer game of yours allowed you to &#39;see&#39; SCP-7095 in a way.

**Thomas Sokol:** It wasn&#39;t ideal, but this program we developed allowed us to detect the various qualities of this strange world, and overlay them with something we could understand. Whether it be the walls and structures that make up the landscape, or the dangerous beings that call this place their home, our tech was more than capable of mapping it all out. But the biggest prize of this endeavor was the discovery of vast amounts of an exotic energy permeating this world and its inhabitants. Something we dubbed &#39;Delta Energy&#39;, an incredible potential power source that could revolutionize the world, and pave the way into the twenty-first century.

**Dr. ████████████:** Based on the documents we recovered from your headquarters, Project Delta began developing an anomalous drone program to harvest this new energy source from SCP-7095-1 instances, correct? 

**Thomas Sokol:** Indeed, we had some very powerful people invested in our cause, and a lot of money for research and development into drone technology far beyond what was possible at the time.

**Dr. ████████████:** Technology is one thing. What we don&#39;t understand is how you gained access to the anomalous tech used in your drones and SCP-7095-DELTA. 

**Thomas Sokol:** Your Foundation isn&#39;t the only party with access to the anomalous, as I&#39;m sure you already know. 

**Dr. ████████████:**  Yes, we are all too aware of that. My superiors will be addressing you about that later[[footnote]]Subsequent interviews revealed Project Delta to have had ties with other Groups of Interest, most notably [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/anderson-robotics-hub Anderson Robotics] and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-wondertainment-hub Doctor Wondertainment][[/footnote]]. So tell me, how exactly does this drone program work?

**Thomas Sokol:** We developed these drones with the capability to extract and store Delta Energy to bring back to our world, while simultaneously using it to power themselves indefinitely. We armed them with specialized weapons powered by this very same energy to repel and even destroy the creatures within the dimension.

**Dr. ████████████:** But you had to control these drones manually?

**Thomas Sokol:** Well, we had tried to use artificial intelligence to control the drones within the dimension, but it wouldn&#39;t work properly. Sure, our program could translate this bizarre world for us to see on the other side, but it wasn&#39;t able to navigate it by its own accord. 

**Dr. ████████████:** Which brings us to the most perplexing question: Why Bad Toys? Of all the things you could&#39;ve used to make SCP-7095 easier to navigate, you chose to depict it as a colorful maze populated with laughing cartoon characters. 

**Thomas Sokol:** In my defense, the original program was far more simplistic. We just had to make it a little more.....fun, I suppose.

**Dr. ████████████:** Why would you need to make it fun? Your stated goal was to harvest energy resources, not to make it into some kind of game.

**Thomas Sokol:** Well, you see, we needed a much bigger workforce. An unwitting workforce, to be frank. We wanted our discovery to be known by as few people as possible, so we found a little-known game developer, one that nobody would really miss. We made them a part of our greater plan and well, the rest is history. 

**Dr. ████████████:** So...you had them develop Bad Toys 3D and merge it with SCP-7095-DELTA, so that players of the game could harvest energy for you?

**Thomas Sokol:** Crazy as it sounds, it was a perfect plan, and players would be none the wiser! What we had on our hands was a well-oiled machine operated by simply playing a game! Delta Energy could&#39;ve changed everything, brought the world a continuous and clean power source. The applications were limitless!

**Dr. ████████████:** Except it didn&#39;t work out that way, did it?

//Dr. Sokol pauses for approximately ten seconds before responding.//

**Thomas Sokol:** No. No it did not...

**Dr. ████████████:** Can you explain why it didn&#39;t work?

**Thomas Sokol:** As you&#39;ve surely figured out by now, the laws of our universe don&#39;t exactly play well with whatever laws govern theirs. Delta Energy was an all too perfect example of this. Sure, we made attempts to stabilize it, to prevent it from distorting reality around us, but doing so left us with nothing more than translucent sludge.

**Dr. ████████████:** Yes, that very same substance that SCP-7095-1 instances become when they&#39;re forced to follow the laws of our reality. 

**Thomas Sokol:** The very same. Years of hard work and money for useless slime...

**Dr. ████████████:** Most people would call your hard work morally reprehensible. Aside from the gross disregard for labor laws, and the natural laws for that matter, you also kept an innocent woman imprisoned in your facility. 

**Thomas Sokol:** My superiors were known to withhold a lot of information from me, despite my high standing. I wasn&#39;t even aware she was being kept there until these recent events, but that fact will haunt me for the rest of my life.

**Dr. ████████████:** You&#39;ve failed to mention the other consequence of your actions. 

**Thomas Sokol:** You mean how those awful things could use the drones to get to our world? You should know that my programming team developed a failsafe function to artificially end the game if the creatures got too close. To keep them from damaging our drones, the program would instantaneously pull them back to our world. 

**Dr. ████████████:** Then you clearly didn&#39;t test your software very thoroughly.

**Thomas Sokol:** We...did rush it out towards the end. But I never would&#39;ve allowed it to be released had we known that the creatures could use the game to enter our reality. I&#39;m still not sure how that&#39;s even scientifically possible.

**Dr. ████████████:** You should know that science has no bearing on the anomalous. Especially considering your apparent experience with such phenomena.

//Dr. Sokol slouches in his chair, visibly uncomfortable, but does not respond.//

**Dr. ████████████:** I have one final question for you, Dr. Sokol. Why did you decide to come to us? After everything that happened, you had the opportunity to disappear and avoid being taken into custody by the Foundation. But instead, you willingly approached our gates, and revealed all that you know about your operation. Why us?

**Thomas Sokol:** I came to you because I&#39;m scared shitless of what&#39;s to come. 

**Dr. ████████████:** Of what? The program&#39;s been shut down. SCP-7095 is effectively contained. 

**Thomas Sokol:** There&#39;s far more to the inhabitants of that horrible dimension than I thought. They were nothing but obstacles to our goal before. Just some dumb creatures that happened to kill in awful ways. I mean, we only ever tested their effects on lab rats, but to see them work human bodies like clay. It just-

//Dr. Sokol takes a long pause, and his hands begin to shake.//

**Dr. ████████████:** You saw one of them?

**Thomas Sokol:** All I remember, is that it smiled at me while it was contorting that poor woman&#39;s body. After all that has happened, I&#39;m afraid I was very wrong in my prior judgement.

**Dr. ████████████:** Are you trying to say SCP-7095-1 are actually intelligent beings?

**Thomas Sokol:** No, not intelligent. Not really. But they are very much curious. In fact, there&#39;s an almost child-like curiosity in the way they toy with our bodies. Twisting them, changing them, breaking them as if they were nothing more than playthings. But what really scares me is that they are aware of us now. Of our existence. Of this beautiful world of ours. I have reason to believe they&#39;re finding their own way through.

**Dr. ████████████:** You mean, without SCP-7095-DELTA?

**Thomas Sokol:** Project Delta was shut down when our endeavors for energy proved fruitless. That massacre your agents walked into? It happened AFTER we shut the program down. Yet they still managed to open their own doorway through one of our computers. As far as I know, this had never happened before. That is why I&#39;ve come to you, to ask that your Foundation restart the Project Delta program. 

**Dr. ████████████:** You know we can&#39;t do that. SCP-7095-DELTA could&#39;ve caused much more damage had it not been shut it down, so we intend to keep it that way. 

**Thomas Sokol:** You don&#39;t understand! Those creatures are aware of us now, all because of our hubris. My entire team, my friends, they&#39;re all gone because of me. All that&#39;s left is to try and make things right. I don&#39;t know if we can destroy them all, but our drones provide the perfect distraction to keep them at bay. To control their attention so they won&#39;t find their own ways through.

**Dr. ████████████:** We will keep your proposal in mind, but as of right now, our current containment procedures will remain as they are.

//Dr. Sokol quickly rises from his seat.//

**Thomas Sokol:** Please, you must listen to me! Project Delta is the key to our survival! 

**Dr. ████████████:** Thank you Doctor Sokol for your time. Our guards will escort you back to your quarters.

//The two guards have to forcibly remove Thomas Sokol, who appears visibly distressed, from the interview chamber.//

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Despite his lofty claims about SCP-7095-DELTA, Doctor Sokol&#39;s information appears to match up with documentation recovered from Incident-7095-1. It&#39;s my recommendation that he be kept in Foundation custody in the event his predictions about SCP-7095 are proven to be accurate.

**Addendum-7095-3:**

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Incident-7095-2 Log 1&#34; hide=&#34;- hide block&#34;]]

On 08/13/1999, after nearly two years of inactivity, numerous SCP-7095-1 entities began to breach containment and enter baseline reality at seemingly random locations around the world. While most of these breaches occurred in areas with low civilian populations, one notable incident at a shopping mall in ████████, Australia resulted in ██ casualties, due in part to an unforeseen anomalous effect of SCP-7095 that [DATA REDACTED]. While the other breaches were swiftly dealt with by Foundation field agents, Mobile Task Force Eta-10 (&#34;See No Evil&#34;) was dispatched to resolve the incident in Australia. The following logs are video transcripts of the attack from their body cameras.


[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Team:** Mobile Task Force Eta-10 (&#34;See No Evil&#34;)

**Members:** Agents Morey Wilson (lead), Natalia Gaines, Trent Coolridge, Jasper Rodriguez and Gwendelyn Shaw

**Notes:** MTF Eta-10 was chosen for their experience in handling cognitohazardous objects and entities. All members were equipped with modified SCRAMBLE goggles for the mission. This version of the technology utilizes the SCP-7095-DELTA program to help identify entities that the agents may encounter. In addition, Agent Gaines and Agent Rodriguez were both armed with specialized weapons capable of launching miniature SRAs (Scranton Reality Anchors)[[footnote]]An early precursor to the miniaturized SRA technology used during the containment of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1730 SCP-1730][[/footnote]] to neutralize SCP-7095-1 instances.
----
[BEGIN LOG]

//(MTF Eta-10 are dropped off by helicopter into the park just outside the shopping complex.)//

**Wilson:** Alright, comms check everyone!

**Rodriguez:** I hear ya!

**Shaw:** Good!

**Gaines:** Copy that.

**Coolridge:** Good to go.

**Site Command:** Everything&#39;s good on our end. Make sure your headsets are activated. They will detect and block all visual or auditory cognitohazards caused by SCP-7095-1 entities. 

**Coolridge:** We&#39;re ready, but uh, shouldn&#39;t we have been dropped off closer to the mall?

**Site Command:** We received reports that a dash-one entity escaped from the building and into the park just as you were arriving. We can&#39;t locate it from above due to the thick vegetation, so that one is your first priority. We&#39;ve got eyes on the building, the rest of them are still inside. 

**Wilson:** You heard Command, let&#39;s move!

//(All agents advance into the forested area of the park. Extraneous dialogue removed. After five minutes, deformed and twisted trees come into view.)//

**Coolridge:** It&#39;s a good thing the dash-ones tend to leave a trail.

**Shaw:** Not sure if I&#39;d consider that a good thing in most cases. Look at what it did to those trees. Dear god, one of them is moving!

//(Footage shows that one of the trees has been fused with multiple unidentified bird species. Other trees are seen to have various small animals, such as possums, merged into their trunks and branches.)//

[[include component:image-block | name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Weird_tree_%284511809846%29.jpg | caption=A tree that has been deformed by the effects of an SCP-7095-1 instance. | width=50%]]

**Rodriguez:** It&#39;s nothing we haven&#39;t seen before with these things.

**Shaw:** Doesn&#39;t make it any less disturbing.

**Wilson:** We must be getting close, keep your eyes peeled. Rodriguez, be ready to launch an SRA at that thing when we spot it.

//(The team advances around a grove of deformed trees. As they enter a clearing, the SCP-7095-1 instance can be seen hanging from the canopy of a larger tree, though it&#39;s only visible as a distorted shape on body cameras. The branches of the tree are rapidly twisting and elongating as the entity moves through the canopy.)//

**Wilson:** Alright, keep it cool everyone.

**Shaw:** My visor&#39;s showing a spring character.

**Coolridge:** That would explain the trees. You got that SRA ready?

//(The instance appears to notice the team. It emits a noise that&#39;s picked up by recording equipment as loud static. After a brief pause, the entity causes branches from the tree to quickly extend and twist towards the agents, with many of them drilling into the ground as they back up.)//

**Wilson:** Shit! Rodriguez?!

**Rodriguez:** It&#39;s too high up, we need it at ground level!

**Shaw:** I&#39;m gonna take a shot at it, see if I can scare it down!

//(Agent Shaw fires a couple of shots at the entity, causing it to fall from the tree. Upon impact, the ground beneath it begins to warp and sink down. The entity appears to begin hopping towards the agents, pushing the ground down with each landing.)//

**Wilson:** Do it now!

**Rodriguez:** Ah, perfect!

//(Agent Rodriguez launches the SRA, which activates near the instance and neutralizes it in a flash of light. The ground has been coated with the translucent remains of the entity.)//

**Gaines:** Jesus, that was close for comfort.

**Rodriguez:** Damn right, left a mess, too. Look at this shit.

**Wilson:** Cleanup crew&#39;s gonna love all of this. Good shot, Rodriguez. And you too, Shaw. Now that we got the easy part out of the way, time to move on to the shopping mall.

**Gaines:** Can&#39;t wait.

//(The team quickly begins to head back towards the shopping complex. The screams of civilians running from the building can be heard in the distance through the video feed.)//

**Wilson:** Command? We can confirm that the escaped instance has been terminated. We&#39;re moving towards the mall right now. Any idea how many more of these we&#39;ll be facing?

**Site Command:** Well done, but I&#39;m afraid we have no intel on what&#39;s going on inside the building. We&#39;ve set up a perimeter, but none of our field agents are equipped to deal with whatever is in there. 

**Rodriguez:** So our mission is to exterminate every last one of them, eh? Kinda surprising, we&#39;re usually brought in to contain anomalies rather than destroy them.

**Gaines:** Has the Foundation ever tried to contain one of these things?

**Wilson:** These creatures don&#39;t....contain all that well. Solid steel can hold them back for a while, but even then they&#39;ll eventually make their way through that, too. 

**Shaw:** You certainly know a lot about these beings, don&#39;t you?

**Wilson:** I would know, I attempted to contain quite a few of them during the initial outbreak. Never thought I&#39;d have to deal with them again.

//(Extraneous dialogue redacted. Agents arrive at the mall entrance and are greeted by Foundation field agents. Personnel can be seen tending to civilians that have escaped the building along the perimeter.)//

**Wilson:** Command, we&#39;ve arrived at the entrance. Anything else we should know before we move in?

**Site Command:** We&#39;re receiving fluctuating Hume readings from within the building. Needless to say, there&#39;s a lot of activity going on in there. Tread carefully.

**Coolridge:** Wonderful. Get ready to enter hell.

//(MTF Eta-10 enters the mall with weapons drawn. They make their way down the main hall. No notable activity for five minutes. The agents come to an intersection within the mall. Deformities in the architecture are noticed near the food court, so they move towards it.)//

**Shaw:** Okay, my Kant counter&#39;s definitely picking up something over there.

**Coolridge:** What ARE those?

//(The team enters the food court. The floor is littered with malformed figures completely covered in multicolored fur. Some of them are twitching and writhing along the ground.)//

**Wilson:** Coolridge! Gaines! Keep your eyes up, the one that did this can fly. 

**Coolridge:** My god, are these things alive?

**Wilson:** Those &#34;things&#34; were people. 

**Shaw:** Can we help any of them? Some of them are still moving.

**Wilson:** There&#39;s no helping them. That fur on their bodies? Spaghettified organs, pulled right out of them through their pores. Best we can do is end their misery. 

**Rodriguez:** That&#39;s just about the sickest thing I&#39;ve ever heard. 

//(The agents search the area, avoiding the mutated bodies on the ground. No other sign of any SCP-7095-1 instances can be found.)//

**Gaines:** Well, whatever did this doesn&#39;t seem to be around anymore. 

**Shaw** Kant readings are still high, though. Could it be the bodies? 

**Wilson:** No, a dash-one&#39;s handiwork shouldn&#39;t be giving any readings. Something else is still here with us.

**Rodriguez:** Check this fuzzball out. It&#39;s wriggling around like crazy.

//(A particularly large corpse can be seen rapidly twitching and moving around on the floor, causing the team to get a closer look. After a few seconds, the corpse suddenly begins to expand.)//

**Gaines:** Holy crap!

**Wilson:** Back up, everyone!

//(After expanding to three times its size, the corpse bursts open, revealing a SCP-7095-1 instance inside. The entity begins to float towards the agents after emitting a noise.)//

**Wilson:** Gaines, it&#39;s your turn!

**Gaines:** Already on it, sir!

//(Agent Gaines launches an SRA at the instance, which detonates and neutralizes the instance.)//

**Rodriguez:** Nice one! I bet it really felt that!

//(Agent Wilson walks over to the remains of the body the entity burst out of.)//

**Wilson:** Huh, never seen one hide like that before. 

**Rodriguez:** Hope these bastards aren&#39;t getting smarter.

**Shaw** Something&#39;s wrong. The Hume readings are still high in this area.

//(The agents begin to frantically look around. Multiple other corpses around the food court begin to expand like the first one, expelling two additional instances. One of them manages to grab ahold of Agent Coolridge. The entity causes numerous glowing holes to open up on his body and clothing, merging parts of his skin with his armor.)//

**Gaines:** No! Trent!

**Rodriguez:** I got you!

//(Agent Rodriguez proceeds to launch an SRA that lands beneath the instance holding Agent Coolridge, neutralizing it in a flash of light. Coolridge falls to the ground, badly wounded by the effects of the entity.)//

**Rodriguez** Guys, the other one&#39;s closing in fast!

**Wilson:** Shaw, watch out!

**Shaw** Oh shit, he-

//(The second instance lunges at Agent Shaw, lifting and stretching her upper torso into the air while still attached to her lower body at ground level. Her arms and jaw begin to elongate and hang back down towards the floor. Distorted screaming from Agent Shaw can be heard on the video feed, before the connection with her headset is lost. The instance quickly drags her mangled body down a corridor and out of sight.)//

**Rodriguez** NO! Damnit, what did it do to her?! 

**Gaines:** We have to help her!

**Wilson:** No! I&#39;m sorry, there&#39;s no helping her now. Command, do you copy?

**Site Command:** We hear you. What&#39;s happened? 

**Wilson:** We lost Shaw, and Coolridge got pretty messed up by one of those things. Please advise.

**Site Command:** Damn, how&#39;d they get the jump on you?

**Wilson:** They ambushed us by hiding inside the corpses lying around here. Our headsets identified them as fairly mundane variants, but they seemed to be much more coordinated. Have you guys ever seen that happen before?

**Site Command:** No, this is not a good sign. Agent Wilson, regroup and get your people out of there. We&#39;re working on getting you reinforcements outside.

**Wilson:** Copy that. Gaines, get his legs, I&#39;ll hold him from the other side. Rodriguez, you keep that launcher ready to use at a moment&#39;s notice. You&#39;re taking the lead.

//(Agents Wilson and Gaines lift up Coolridge&#39;s body onto a table in the food court, and use it as a makeshift gurney. The team backtracks to the entrance of the building without further incident.)//

**Team:** Mobile Task Force Eta-10 (&#34;See No Evil&#34;), 

**Members:** Agents Morey Wilson (lead), Natalia Gaines, Jasper Rodriguez, Inessa Orlova, Skylar Chen, and Levi Graham

**Notes:** Due to the losses incurred during the initial exploration, MTF Eta-10 was given three additional operatives with more combat experience to assist with this mission. Agents Gaines, Rodriguez, and Chen were armed with SRA launchers, and the newer recruits received their own SCRAMBLE headsets. Preparations for reentry took two hours after the initial attempt, during which no SCP-7095-1 activity was observed from the outside.

[BEGIN LOG]

//(All team members are standing outside the entrance to the shopping complex.)//

**Wilson:** Okay, comms check. Everybody read?

**Gaines:** Copy that. 

**Rodriguez:** Ready to go again.

**Wilson:** And our three newcomers?

**Chen:** I&#39;m good.

**Graham:** Loud and clear!

**Orlova:** Looks like we&#39;re all good here.

**Site Command:** Comms are good on our end. Prepare to enter the building.

**Wilson:** Alright, I trust that the three of you got the rundown of what we&#39;re up against? The entities here have proven to be smarter than expected. They took a good woman from us, and mutilated another one of our guys. I don&#39;t intend to lose anyone else to these freaks.

**Graham:** Amen to that.

**Rodriguez:** Let&#39;s finish these things off for good this time. For Gwen, for Trent, we won&#39;t let their sacrifice be in vain.

**Wilson:** If we&#39;re all on the same page then, let&#39;s move in!

//(All agents proceed to enter the building. No activity is observed as the team approaches the food court where the last encounter occurred.)//

**Orlova:** It&#39;s been pretty empty through here, and the Kant counter isn&#39;t picking up much. You sure there&#39;s any left?

**Wilson:** Command&#39;s still picking up some powerful readings from further in the building. 

//(Agent Wilson goes to inspect the remaining fur-covered corpses. Agent Orlova follows with her Kant counter.)//

**Orlova:** Nothing coming up here, either.

**Rodriguez:** That last one took Shaw down the northern corridor. 

**Chen:** Then that&#39;s as good a place to start as any.

//(The team proceeds through the northern corridor for several minutes before reaching the entrance to what appears to be an arcade. Agent Orlova&#39;s Kant counter begins to make noise.)//

**Orlova:** Okay, now I&#39;m definitely picking something up from in there.

**Graham:** Don&#39;t lie, you just wanna play some Street Fighter, don&#39;t ya?

//(Some of the other agents can be heard giggling at the remark.)//

**Wilson:** Let&#39;s cool it with the jokes, these things don&#39;t mess around. Be mindful of what shows up on your headset. Those dumb little cartoons they display can help identify dangerous variants, so they might just save your life. Command? We&#39;re about to head into the entertainment district through the arcade. We&#39;re getting some nasty readings from in there.

**Site Command:** You may proceed. Be careful, you&#39;re close to the center of the shopping complex where we&#39;ve been getting the most erratic Hume readings.

**Wilson:** Understood. Alright everyone, let&#39;s move in.

//(The operatives all proceed down the entry hall of the arcade. Close examination of the footage revealed that parts of the walls and ceiling tiles along the hall had been deformed with a subtle cobblestone pattern, though this goes unnoticed by the team.)//

**Orlova:** Kant readings are getting stronger.

**Rodriguez:** That&#39;s comforting.

//(Agents Graham and Gaines slowly open the doors and look into the large, multilevel arcade. Most of the machines and games have been significantly warped and mutilated, with many of them seemingly melted together with human corpses. Three unique SCP-7095-1 variants can be seen; one floating near the second level, and two at the ground level. The agents close the doors again.)//

**Gaines:** You guys won&#39;t wanna go in there. 

**Graham:** Least we found something. My visor was showing a literal clay pigeon flying overhead, a toy spider on the ground near us, and a...dancing soda can towards the back?

**Wilson:** Shit, that last one is extremely fast.

**Orlova:** Seriously?

**Gaines:** The clay bird is the one that killed Gwen. That one&#39;s mine.

**Wilson:** We need to strategize here. If they all notice us, the furthest entity will reach our position much faster than the other two.

**Orlova:** Okay, how about this? These doors seem to be made of heavy metal, so they will at least shield us for a bit when it charges at us. We can launch an SRA just as it gets through the door.

**Wilson:** That&#39;s as good of a plan as we&#39;ll get under the circumstances. Gaines, do you think you can reach the bird from here?

**Gaines:** It&#39;s far, but just within range. 

**Wilson:** Okay, you and Chen are both going to launch your SRAs at the same time, at the two closest entities. The moment you pull the trigger, fall back so Graham and I can close the doors. That third one will reach us within a couple seconds. When it gets through those doors, that will be your cue, Rodriguez. Are we all clear on this?

//(All agents nod in agreement.)//

**Wilson:** Okay, everyone get into position.

//(Agents Wilson and Graham slowly open the doors. Chen and Gaines quietly move into position just within the doorway, while Rodriguez and Orlova move further back down the hall. All launchers are ready.)//

**Wilson:** Get ready. Three...two...one...NOW.

//(Gaines fires her launcher and successfully neutralizes the flying instance, but Chen&#39;s launcher malfunctions. Both agents quickly back up through the doors as they&#39;re closed. The two remaining instances emit a noise upon noticing the agents.)//

**Chen:** Damnit! My launcher&#39;s jammed!

**Wilson:** Fall back! Down the hall!

//(A loud bang occurs at the doors as they begin to warp. Parts of the door rapidly peel outward and curve into serrated edges, emitting multiple bright flashes and sparks. All agents position themselves behind Rodriguez, while Orlova frantically helps Chen to repair her launcher.)//

**Graham:** Jesus! Did Command check these things before they issued them to us?!

**Orlova:** I think I got it!

**Wilson:** Rodriguez! You ready?

//(The instance tears through the door just as Agent Rodriguez launches his SRA. In a flash of light, the entity is neutralized.)//

**Wilson:** Good shot!

**Gaines:** What&#39;s the status of the other launcher?

**Chen:** We got it working again. What happened to the last one?

//(The team quickly makes its way back to the arcade, where the last instance is seemingly crawling along the wall. It moves onto the upper level, flushing out multiple civilians that were apparently hiding in the area.)//

**Rodriguez:** Oh shit, we&#39;ve got civilians here!

//(The entity suddenly emits a noise that causes all of the survivors to fall down and cover their ears with their hands. It proceeds to grab one of the civilians and seemingly flays their skin in an instant, producing an eruption of a web-like substance from their body over a wide area.)//

**Graham:** What the hell did it just do to him?!

**Wilson:** Nevermind that, we need to get the rest of these people out of here!

//(The survivors regain their footing and frantically run towards the agents, screaming for help and tumbling down a staircase along the right. The instance snatches up another civilian and escapes through a corridor leading to the movie theaters. The agents make their way up the staircase, helping and directing the remaining survivors out of the arcade.)//

**Gaines:** Can&#39;t believe there are still some people alive in here.

**Wilson:** Everyone, get out of the arcade! Make your way to the southside entrance. Run STRAIGHT to the authorities with your hands in the air! Command, we&#39;ve got about a dozen survivors headed towards the perimeter at the southern entrance.

**Site Command:** Understood, our men will be waiting for them. What&#39;s the status of the dash-one entities? 

**Wilson:** Two more neutralized, but one escaped towards the theaters.

**Orlova:** Sir, that last one took another civilian. We need to hurry!

**Rodriguez:** They&#39;ll be dead or worse by now.

**Site Command:** Agent Wilson, take your team into the theaters and get the job done. We&#39;ll take care of the survivors.

**Wilson:** Alright. Everyone, are your weapons ready?

//(All operatives give an affirmative nod.)//

**Rodriguez:** Let&#39;s finish these fuckers off.

//(The team proceeds down the corridor, which has experienced substantial deformation by the entities.  When entering the theater lobby, all of the agents&#39; body cameras begin to malfunction, showing patches of static throughout the captured footage. Agent Chen appears to examine one of the walls of the lobby.)//

**Chen:** This...is so weird.

**Rodriguez:** You mean compared to all the other shit we&#39;ve seen today?

**Chen:** Well, it&#39;s been nothing but chaos, no sense in the deformities we&#39;ve seen. But look at some of the walls around here. This plastered wall slowly changes into brick, and then into...what looks like some kind of bathroom tile?

**Orlova:** Now that you mention it, a lot of the surfaces around here are messed up. Look at the ceiling, it goes from wood paneling, to brick, and then to cinderblock.

//(The previous observations cannot be confirmed due to the aforementioned interference.)//

**Graham:** I think the architects were on something when they designed this place.

**Gaines:** Save the sightseeing for another time. Chen, what&#39;s your counter saying?

**Chen:** Uh, hold on. I&#39;m getting high readings down the right corridor.

//(The agents proceed to the right. Upon turning the corner, the footage becomes completely unintelligible due to anomalous interference. The team can be heard audibly gasping.)//

**Orlova:** What the hell? Okay, something&#39;s definitely not right here.

**Wilson:** Damnit, this is bad. Command, we have a proble-

//(Direct communications with the team are breaking down.)//

**Wilson:** -ease advise-

**Site Command:** Agent Wilson? Your comms are breaking down. Can you repeat?

//(Agent Wilson&#39;s response is unintelligible.)//

**Site Command:** Damnit! Does anybody read?

//(The sound of garbled static grows louder.)//

**Gains:** It&#39;s all bricks-

//(Nothing but static, isolated sounds from the team, and a moment of distorted screaming can be heard for the next thirty-seven minutes.)//

[END LOG]

**Closing Notes:** After nearly forty minutes of no communication with MTF Eta-10, a sudden stabilization of Hume levels occurred within the building. However, parts of the inner structure of the █████ Mall were found to have collapsed in the process. Despite this, field agents were able to recover the entirety of MTF Eta-10 from the ravaged theater area of the building. Although some of the operatives sustained injuries and deformities from SCP-7095-1 instances, all members were expected to survive, and the mission was deemed a success.

**Interviewed:** Agents Morey Wilson and Natalia Gaines

**Interviewer:** Director Markus Charbonneau

**Foreword:** This interview is being conducted to determine the events leading up to the neutralization of the remaining SCP-7095-1 instances during Incident-7095-2.

----

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Director Charbonneau:** Alright, you two know the procedure here.

**Agent Wilson:** Of course, I&#39;m Agent Morey Wilson, leader of MTF Eta-10.

**Agent Gaines:** I&#39;m Natalia Gaines, second-in-command of Eta-10.

**Director Charbonneau:** It&#39;s been a crazy past few days for you and your team, hasn&#39;t it? How are you feeling about the outcome of the mission in Australia?

**Agent Gaines:** Mixed feelings, to put it lightly.

**Agent Wilson:** Same here. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m proud of what our team was able to accomplish, but we still lost a great agent to those things, and another might not be able to walk again.

**Agent Gaines:** How...is Tren- I mean, how is Agent Coolridge holding up?

**Director Charbonneau:** His very physiology was altered by SCP-7095-1&#39;s effects, and he will have to undergo multiple surgeries just to get his body functioning properly again. That being said, I&#39;m told he&#39;s in good spirits under the circumstances.

**Agent Gaines:** That&#39;s good to hear. 

**Agent Wilson:** And Rodriguez?

**Director Charbonneau:** Undergoing psychiatric treatment as we speak. It remains to be seen if his mental health recovers from this experience. 

**Agent Wilson:** Thank you, sir. I know that we&#39;re not allowed to see them right now, but please let them know that they&#39;re in our thoughts.

**Director Charbonneau:** I&#39;ll see what I can do. Now, I&#39;ve heard that some of your other teammates didn&#39;t come out of this unscathed. Agent Orlova in particular was very angry at you, Wilson. She said you abandoned her as she was being attacked by an SCP-7095-1 instance.

**Agent Wilson:** I&#39;d consider it a tactical decision on my part, and take full responsibility for any consequences of that decision. But I&#39;d already lost two people on this mission. I knew very well what the variant that attacked Orlova was capable of, but I also knew that the one about to lunge at Agent Chen would&#39;ve killed her in an instant. It was a choice between saving one life, or saving two, and I would choose the latter every time.

**Director Charbonneau:** I&#39;ve been told that Agent Orlova&#39;s new skin condition is permanent.

**Agent Wilson:** And Agent Chen would&#39;ve lost her skin completely. Orlova can live with looking like a Smurf for the rest of her life.

//Agent Gaines smirks while looking down.//

**Agent Gaines:** This interview is confidential, right?

**Director Charbonneau:** Yes, but let&#39;s try to be a little more professional, okay?

**Agent Wilson:** Understood, sir.

**Agent Gaines:** Apologies, but after everything that&#39;s happened, I feel like we could use a little levity.

**Director Charbonneau:** Right, let&#39;s talk about what happened, then. Towards the end of your mission, we lost contact with your entire team. I would like the two of you to describe the sequence of events leading up to the neutralization of the remaining SCP-7095-1 instances. What did you see that caused your team to panic?

**Agent Gaines:** It&#39;s quite simple really. What we saw was the game.

**Director Charbonneau:** The...game?

**Agent Gaines:** Yes, as in SCP-7095-DELTA. We turned that corner in the theater lobby, and saw a hallway that looked like it came straight out of Bad Toys. Pixelated bricks and all. 

**Agent Wilson:** Obviously, we weren&#39;t actually in the game, but our headsets made it appear as if we were. 

**Director Charbonneau:** But how? The program would&#39;ve only displayed those visuals over the physical features within SCP-7095. 

**Agent Gaines:** And therein lies the problem. It was as if the world of SCP-7095 was, for lack of a better word, leaking into our world. Has the Foundation seen this happen before?

**Director Charbonneau:** No, that is very concerning to say the least. During our analysis of your footage, we did notice some odd architectural inconsistencies around the arcade. Ones that were, shall we say, distinct from the usual distortions of physical matter caused by SCP-7095-1 entities.

**Agent Gaines:** That was different, those inconsistencies were still a part of our reality, far as we could tell.

**Agent Wilson:** It just felt so wrong, even compared to the chaotic deformations we&#39;re used to with these creatures. It&#39;s like our world was being influenced by how we perceive their world through the lens of the game, if that makes any sense.

**Agent Gaines:** And the further into the building we got, the more their dimension was mixing with ours.

**Director Charbonneau:** Hmm, that is interesting. Do you believe they could be more intelligent than we originally thought?

**Agent Wilson:** No idea. Frankly, we know jack shit about these things.

**Director Charbonneau:** Again, please be professional.

**Agent Wilson:** Right, I&#39;m just saying that it&#39;s been over two years since its discovery, and we still know frighteningly little about what the dash-ones are capable of. Or their world, for that matter.

**Director Charbonneau:** Well, we hope to find out more about that from your experiences. Tell me, what happened after we lost contact with you?

**Agent Wilson:** As Agent Gaines stated, we had pretty much entered the game at that point. It started out like a patchwork of our reality and that of SCP-7095. As we went further down the corridor, we&#39;d found that the entity that escaped us earlier had made short work of the civilian it had taken. 

**Agent Gaines:** It used the civilian to block the entrance to one of the theaters. It was like a spider web had exploded from that poor man&#39;s skinless body. Rodriguez and Graham had to use their knives to cut through the webbing.

**Director Charbonneau:** My god.

**Agent Gaines:** That wasn&#39;t even the worst part. As they were cutting, the body started flailing and screaming in agony. It took a swing at Rodriguez&#39;s head and damaged his SCRAMBLE gear. I...shot the victim in the head to stop the screaming. 

**Agent Wilson:** It had to be done, he was suffering.

**Director Charbonneau:** Understandable, given the situation. 

**Agent Wilson:** Rodriguez saw parts of the anomaly with his own eyes. The SCRAMBLE goggles had been knocked off his head, and he immediately began to suffer the psychological effects of SCP-7095. He was no longer fit to continue the mission, so he relinquished his SRA launcher to me. Agent Graham stayed with him while we went ahead.

**Director Charbonneau:** I see, so you found that SCP-7095-1 instance hiding in the theater auditorium?

**Agent Wilson:** Yes, along with three others. They all attempted to ambush us. 

**Agent Gaines:** The first one we saw one looked like a soldier toy, the same variant that attacked Coolridge. Agent Chen was able to kill it with her launcher. But the other three appeared from the theater balcony above us. Two of the entities immediately went after Orlova and Chen, while the third one chose to attack me.

**Agent Wilson:** Of course, Agent Gaines was more than capable of handling herself. As I mentioned before, I chose to terminate the spider-like instance that was about to attack Agent Chen. Regrettably, I had to let the blue one with the swirly eye give Orlova her new skin tone. Chen was able to destroy it afterwards.

**Director Charbonneau:** So those were the last remaining entities?

**Agent Wilson:** As far as we could tell, yes. But there was a bigger problem. That auditorium we were in? It was ground zero, the origin point of this particular manifestation, but it was still //open//.

**Director Charbonneau:** What do you mean?

**Agent Wilson:** I mean the theater screen had become one big rectangular opening into their world. We could see right through as if there wasn&#39;t any wall at the front of the auditorium. It just opened up into a big room made up of those same pixelated brick walls, and on the other side, there were so many dash-one entities.

 **Agent Gaines:** They didn&#39;t try to come through, they just...stared at us the whole time while we were killing their buddies.

**Director Charbonneau:** Stared at you? 

 **Agent Gaines:** Well, it was hard to tell for obvious reasons. But in some weird way, we could all feel that they were watching us. Just the thought of such impossibly malevolent beings hiding behind those googly eyes, it...really makes you wonder what the creators of SCP-7095-DELTA were thinking when they designed this software.

**Director Charbonneau:** We&#39;re trying to figure that out ourselves. 

**Agent Wilson:** Needless to say, we were pretty spooked. If those things tried to make their way in, we would&#39;ve been overwhelmed by their sheer numbers.

**Director Charbonneau:** So what did you do?

**Agent Wilson:** The only thing we could think to do. We used every last SRA we had, set them up around the opening to their dimension, and rigged them to detonate all at once. Orlova had the technical know-how to do this, and even set them on a timer so we could escape.

**Director Charbonneau:** I assume that didn&#39;t work out so well? You were still in the theater lobby when we found you.

 **Agent Gaines:** We tried to backtrack, but the whole area had become further transformed while we were in the theater. It was like a colorful maze, and we couldn&#39;t find our way out.

**Agent Wilson:** When the SRAs went off, it pulled everything from their world back through the opening. Left us an unstable mess of a theater that nearly buried us.

**Director Charbonneau:** It&#39;s a good thing we found you when we did. 

 **Agent Gaines:** Yeah, I&#39;d say we&#39;re all grateful for that.

**Agent Wilson:** Anyways, that pretty much sums up what happened to us in there. If I may, sir, I&#39;d like to say something else for the record.

**Director Charbonneau:** Of course.

**Agent Wilson:** I have been dealing with this SCP and the monsters within it since the beginning. I have NEVER seen anything quite like what we saw during this last mission. Take it from myself or the rest of my team who were essentially walking inside their world. Everything about it is so incomprehensively wrong. The feeling of it. We obviously couldn&#39;t see it in its true form, it was all just colored walls and cartoony characters through our visors. But we could feel with every molecule of our bodies just how horribly wrong this place is.

//Agent Wilson pauses for a moment.//

**Agent Wilson:** What I&#39;m trying to say, is the Foundation needs to make every effort to contain this thing. To keep it out of our world. If even one of those openings were to be left uncontrolled, it could destroy everything.

 **Director Charbonneau:** Believe me when I say we&#39;re doing everything in our power to contain SCP-7095. Thank you for your time, Agent Wilson and Agent Gaines. 

**Agent Wilson:** Of course, sir.

**Agent Gaines:** Thank you.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Agent Wilson&#39;s and Agent Gaines&#39;s recounting of the events of Incident-7095-2 has been corroborated by the other members of MTF Eta-10. In order to prevent these breaches of SCP-7095 from getting out of control, we may have to rely on more unconventional methods of containment to ensure the safety of our world.

[[/div]]

Sporadic breaches of SCP-7095-1 instances into baseline reality continued to occur for nearly three months until current containment procedures could be established. With cooperation from Dr. Thomas Sokol, SCP-7095-DELTA was reactivated to assist in the containment of SCP-7095 and its inhabitants. These measures were deemed necessary by the O5-Council, as uncontrolled breaches by SCP-7095-1 into our dimension could ultimately bring about a CK-Class Reality Restructuring Scenario. To facilitate these efforts, the former Project Delta complex has been repurposed and reestablished as Area-95. SCP-7095 and its component anomalies have since been collectively reclassified as Esoteric.
