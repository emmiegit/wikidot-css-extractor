[!--If you are translating any of my works, you may notice that I use the Trans Pride logo &amp; banner on every article I post. As I understand it, according to [https://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14274488/discussion-celebrating-diversity-on-site#post-5130695 this 05command post] made by Gene R, some countries explicitly have laws against such content appearing anywhere. If you are translating my works, and your country has laws against such stuff, you are free to remove it in order to be able to post translations of these works to your site. This said, if your country does not have a law against such, &amp;/or your country later repeals such laws, I would kindly request you keep these CSS changes in any translation you post, &amp; add the corresponding theme to your site. I cannot force you to, of course, but it would be kindly appreciated. In a similar request, if you come across any instances where I refer to myself as &#34;they&#34;, &#34;them&#34;, or &#34;their&#34; (either on a hub page, in a discussion post, in an article, etc.), or you wish to refer to me in a post you make, &amp; your language does not have a gender-neutral pronoun equivalent, you should use feminine pronouns for me, unless the text specifies otherwise. I greatly appreciate every single translation done on any one of my works, so I wish to accommodate other branches however possible. If you have any questions related to any of my work that you need answered to make translation easier, I will gladly help out however I am able. Thank you very much for considering my requests.--]

[!--Feel free to not translate the below, if you are translating this page.--]
[[collapsible show=&#34; &#34;]]
if inactive, the following get custody of the following articles. under no circumstances do i approve rewrites of any articles i wrote, even my collaborations, except for specific cases i will note of. people with custody of my articles may try to contact me about changes to the article or otherwise are free to do minor changes, such as: touch up grammar/spelling/clinical tone (barring exceptions noted either in the source code or in the discussion thread proper) and approve of sensible crosslinks, add related tales/translations/readings/etc of the scp in the info box, change/update themes (provided the trans logo prominently remains in some fashion on the page), and even make minor changes to story stuff if they feel it is warranted and in the spirit of the rest of the article.

dolphinslugchugger: custody by default of articles, either from an article not listed here or taking over/superseding another custodian for custody of an article for various reasons. also anime is art too guys, by default, as it is now its article. if inactive or unwilling to have custody, all articles shall be considered without a custodian, ie, as per normal with articles from inactive or unknown authors.

eldritchcadence: 2091, 930-j, my beloved gecko

djkaktus: 2091, leeway, damej (can be rewritten if needed as i did not contribute enough to the article to have a say in blocking any major updates or improvements), eternal bliss delight

☆Kyun~! Let&#39;s All Give It Our Very Best To Stop This Apocalypse! ٩(｡•́‿•̀｡)۶ ☆ (tygently, minmin, jekeld): skies made strange hub, a quiet night and birth of a new day

wrongjohnsilver, psul: prelude: primae formae,  wriggle like a fucking eel

jacob conwell: 2906 (may be updated or rewritten as conwell sees fit, as i doubt tg or i will be super motivated to do so or care much about it happening), super stars

a random day: 150

lordstonefish: like clockwork

faminepulse: damej (can be rewritten if needed as i did not contribute enough to the article to have a say in blocking any major updates or improvements)

th4nkyoub3n: 3090, major updates must be approved by dolphinslugchugger or someone dolphinslugchugger trusts to approve such.

the great hippo: the physical world

doctor cimmerian: 2290 by default, as it is now his article.

sorver (discord server): all gaw stuff, all my drafts, permission to finish or use any, finished or otherwise.

prussianblue (irc channel, if no longer around, then referring to any of the regular users of that channel): all my drafts, permission to finish or use any, finished or otherwise.

additionally, though i cannot actively stop anyone from doing so (and indeed i would rather include this here than make a post about it), i would rather be contacted via wikidot (some moderators/administrators + whiteguard are able to get in touch with me offsite) if an article of mine is included or adapted into a paid or commercial project. i will not try to stop any included in commercial projects prior to November 27, 2021, but any after would be nice to be approved by me. all free creations (such as art or cosplay etc.) based off my work is fine, but i do not inherently approve or associate with any. i cannot stop whatever content ends up being made, but i do not endorse anything by default.
