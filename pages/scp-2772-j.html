&gt; **Interview SCP-2772-J-01**
&gt; 
&gt; **Honest Salesman:** Dr. Gleason
&gt; 
&gt; **Stingy Bastard:** Agent Caesar Spago
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Agent Spago has just arrived at Site-56 after the conclusion of an unrelated [[[SCP-4618|interview]]].
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gleason:** Hey, Caesar, you&#39;re back! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Spago:** Hi, Gary. It took me seven hours to walk all the way back here from Brighton High, all because Donahue didn&#39;t have the sense to pick me up afterwards. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gleason:** Man, it looks like you needed some reliable transportation! Wait till you see this!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Spago:** That&#39;s nice, but I just want a coffee and some vacation pay right n-
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr. Gleason drags Agent Spago to the Site-56 parking lot without Agent Spago&#39;s consent, and stops in front of SCP-2772-J.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gleason:** Look at this bad boy! It&#39;s got air conditioning, and exclusive trim-
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Spago:** Gary, I don&#39;t want to buy your Explorer. I already have a car.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gleason:** But with //this//, you could&#39;ve driven back instead of walking!
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Spago:** //&lt;in a rage state&gt;// Well, it&#39;s too late now! 
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Spago starts to walk away.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gleason:** Caesar, wait! I still haven&#39;t told you about the seat warmers!
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Following Agent Spago&#39;s refusal to purchase SCP-2772-J, Dr. Gleason was recorded making a sales pitch to Researcher Murrieta, who also refused.

&gt; **Interview SCP-2772-J-02**
&gt; 
&gt; **Opportunity Provider:** Dr. Gleason
&gt; 
&gt; **Annoying Cheapskate:** Dr. Victoria Vomac
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Dr. Vomac is currently in the market for a new vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gleason:** //&lt;meekly&gt;// Vicky, could I speak with you for a second?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Vomac:** Yeah, sure, what do ya need?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gleason:** I heard you&#39;re looking for a car to buy, so I thought that-
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Vomac:** Oh [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-343|343]]], not this again.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gleason:** Yes, this again! My SUV is perfect for your family, and it holds more cargo than that minivan you&#39;re wanting to buy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Vomac:** Gleason, we&#39;ve already been over this. I&#39;m not buying your car.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gleason:** So what?! You&#39;re just gonna sink 30 grand in a mommy-mobile, when you can get my Eddie Bauer for a tenth of that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Vomac:** Get out of my office.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Dr. Vomac&#39;s refusal to get a great deal must be the result of some sort of infohazard. I will have to look into this. -Dr. Gleason

&gt; **Interview SCP-2772-J-03**
&gt; 
&gt; **Deal-Making Doctor:** Dr. Gleason
&gt; 
&gt; **Greedy Miser:** Researcher Taylor Tassajara
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Researcher Tassajara is the only one at Site-56 that Dr. Gleason has not asked at this point.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gleason:** Excuse me? Are you Tassajara?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Tassajara:** Oh, yes. You must be Gleason. Nice to meet you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gleason:** Look, I... I have something I&#39;ve never told anyone before.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Tassajara:** Is this about the Ford you&#39;re trying to sell?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gleason:** No, it&#39;s- actually, yeah, it&#39;s about that. How did you know?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Tassajara:** Everyone warned me about this. And just to get this out of the way, I&#39;m not buying SCP-2772-J.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gleason:** Ah, you&#39;ve seen my database entry. So will you buy it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Tassajara:** //&lt;in an annoyed tone&gt;// I just said no! Get away from me!!
&gt; 
&gt; //Researcher Tassajara runs down the hall, away from Dr. Gleason.//
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Shoot. Looks like the infohazard spread to her, too. -Dr. Gleason

//Director&#39;s Note: Dr. Gleason, the creation of an SCP entry just to sell your SUV is unacceptable. See me in my office.//

&gt; **Interview SCP-2772-J-04**
&gt; 
&gt; **Innocent Entrepreneur:** Dr. Gleason
&gt; 
&gt; **Pretentious Penny-Pincher:** Director Peter Palermo
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** This is a scheduled meeting regarding SCP-2772-J.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Palermo:** Gary Gleason, sit down.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gleason:** Hello, Mr. Palermo. I&#39;ll take cash or credit for my SUV. I have the papers ready.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Palermo:** //&lt;confused&gt;// Wha... what? No, we need to talk about &#34;2772-J&#34;. And it&#39;s //Director// Palermo to you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gleason:** Oh yes, my SUV. If you want, I&#39;m willing to cut a hundred dollars off the price.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Palermo:** This is ridiculous! You cannot write an SCP entry just to advertise your damn car! You need to delete it, or I&#39;m gonna get you terminated.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gleason:** Oh, I see. You&#39;re affected by the infohazard, too.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Palermo:** //&lt;confused out of his mind&gt;// Wha... what??
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gleason:** There&#39;s a infohazard going around causing people to react with hostility towards SCP-2772-J. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m trying to find a cure.
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Palermo:** No, no! This isn&#39;t a infohazard, it&#39;s just that no one wants your car!!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Gleason:** It&#39;s okay, Director Palermo. Your viewpoint isn&#39;t natural, you&#39;re just a victim of a infoha-
&gt; 
&gt; **Director Palermo:** //&lt;in a rage state&gt;// GET OUT OF MY OFFICE!!
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** The Director does not seem to be immune to the infohazard. I should investigate whether it affects civilians. -Dr. Gleason

//Director&#39;s Note: It seems that the only way to get rid of Dr. Gleason&#39;s pleas is to just buy &#34;SCP-2772-J&#34; from him. So, who&#39;s gonna take one for the team? It&#39;s only 1900 bucks now.//</textarea></pre>
