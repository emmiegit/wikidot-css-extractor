++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION HISTORICAL CONTINUITY COMMITTEE

The following file has been found to contain a large number of inaccuracies in relation to the currently modeled historical progression. Through collaboration with the Temporal Anomalies Department this has been confirmed to be a product of the retrocausal anomalies described herein. The progression of events described below can be confirmed to have happened in one or more previous historical progressions with 98.6% certainty.

**Special Containment Procedures:** As there exists no means of preventing SCP-5715 Events, containment efforts are instead focused on documenting any alterations caused by SCP-5715-2. To this end, [[[Welcome to Delta T|Temporal Site-02]]] is to house a data center capable of storing multiple Foundation database backups. These backups are to be continually updated to ensure minimal loss of information between SCP-5715 Events.

Temporal Site-02 has been outfitted with the Tachyon-Flux Monitoring System (TFMS). The TFMS measures tachyon concentrations within our baseline reality to determine if an SCP-5715 Event has occurred. Following the detection of an SCP-5715 Event the TFMS will automatically initiate Protocol Veritas.

SCP-5715-1 is to be housed at Site-17 within a standard humanoid containment cell outfitted with a Mk I XACTS device. SCP-5715-1 is required to see an on-site psychologist weekly to ensure their continued psychological well-being.

To prevent retrocausal tampering, all information relating to SCP-5715 is to be stored within Temporal Site-02&#39;s private database, and may only be accessed through select terminals with IsoCom functionality.[[footnote]]Isochronous Communicator: technology developed to allow for synchronized communication between parties in isolated time frames.[[/footnote]]

**Description:** SCP-5715 is a recurring phenomenon in which universal tachyon flux will cease, effectively halting the flow of time. The interval between subsequent events is seemingly arbitrary, with no determinable factors able to prompt or delay the onset of an SCP-5715 Event. Additionally, a lack of any preemptive signs means SCP-5715 Events can only be confirmed after their occurrence. Thus far the only consistent means of detection is verification from SCP-5715-1 or data analysis done by Protocol Veritas.

SCP-5715 was first discovered by former Foundation researcher Joseph Carter, now SCP-5715-1. Dr. Carter was assigned to Project Kairos, an initiative aimed at developing applications of targeted tachyon emissions. During the course of testing Dr. Carter was exposed directly to a malfunctioning tachyon emitter, which, for unknown reasons, granted them the ability to remain cognizant during SCP-5715 Events.

SCP-5715-2 are entities that only manifest during SCP-5715 Events. Size and form vary greatly between instances, however all share a constantly shifting exterior resembling television static as well as a lack of depth cues[[footnote]]A visual cue that allows an individual to perceive depth in an object.[[/footnote]] resulting in a two-dimensional appearance regardless of vantage point. They do not carry out any biological functions and are non-physical in nature. Instances of SCP-5715-2 will spend the majority of an SCP-5715 Event wandering aimlessly, often phasing through solid matter in the process.[[footnote]]A consequence of any entity occupying an environment with no time, rather than a unique ability possessed by SCP-5715-2.[[/footnote]] The only physical evidence to SCP-5715-2&#39;s existence are the higher than average tachyon concentrations found in locations they have visited.

Instances of SCP-5715-2 are capable of adding or removing items, structures, and organisms (designated as targets) to/from existence. This will retroactively alter all prior interactions with the target, changing history, records, and associated memories to align with the target&#39;s new state of existence. This interaction is theorized to be accomplished through the highly complex manipulation of tachyons entangled to bradyons[[footnote]]Any massive particle that travels slower than the speed of light.[[/footnote]] resulting in a new historical progression. Instances of SCP-5715-2 are believed to be sentient, however all meaningful attempts at two-way communication have thus far failed.

**Addendum 5715-1: Initial Discovery**
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Access Post Event-5715-01 Files&#34; hide=&#34;Close Files&#34;]]
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. David Tyler
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewed:** Dr. Joseph Carter
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** On 02/17/2006 Dr. Carter was working with the Project Kairos research team. During preparations for planned testing Dr. Carter was exposed directly to an active tachyon emitter and was seemingly teleported across Site-17. Immediately following the event Dr. Carter collapsed and began having a seizure. He was rushed to the site&#39;s medical wing for recovery. This interview was conducted the following day.
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tyler:** State your name and title for the record.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** Level three researcher Joseph Carter, currently head technician of Project Kairos.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tyler:** Could you please explain the events leading up to the incident?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** Well, Dr. Richards, Dr. Allen, and myself were sent to prep the observational equipment for the upcoming experiment. It was pretty routine but we kept getting readings from the emitter when we shouldn&#39;t have been, I ended up going into the chamber to fix the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tyler:** Instead of following protocol and reporting the issue?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** Well at first we tried to adjust the receiver remotely, but, regardless of the frequency we dialed in, the emitter just kept firing. The tachyon levels were weak enough to be harmless. Also as head technician I would have to be the one to fix it either way, so yeah, I just went in.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tyler:** And this is when the incident occurred?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** Yes. One moment I was standing in the testing chamber, and the next I was on the other side of the site with my head screaming at me. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tyler:** So... the emitter teleported you across the site?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** That&#39;s what I thought at first but once I could think clearly, I realized I had memories that weren&#39;t there before. It still hurts when I try to think through it all but I definitely remember seeing the others frozen in place, I was trying to get their help but... nothing. I remember running, looking for anybody who wasn&#39;t frozen. Then everything around me started moving again and I got hit with the worst headache of my life.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tyler:** Interesting... well I suppose that covers everything for now. You will be temporarily relocated to an isolated domicile and scheduled for regular testing throughout the next two weeks to insure that no anomalous phenomena persist. After which you will be permitted to return to your work. Understood?
&gt; 
&gt; (//Dr. Carter remains silent, in apparent contemplation//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tyler:** Carter, is that understood?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** What...? Oh yeah, sorry, it&#39;s just that I was... well, I was supposed to see my daughter this weekend.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Tyler:** Unfortunately that will have to wait. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll understand.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** Right.
&gt; 
&gt; [END LOG]
The incident was initially classified as EE-32983. Dr. Carter was placed in temporary containment for testing and observation. Following Event-5715-02 this was reclassified as Event-5715-01.

&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Molly Langman
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewed:** Dr. Joseph Carter
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** On 02/25/2006 security footage of Dr. Carter&#39;s isolation unit captured him seemingly teleporting across the room before collapsing. He was once again taken to the site medical wing for treatment and recovery.
&gt; 
&gt; Containment Specialist Molly Langman personally volunteered to conduct this interview, citing her experience working with Dr. Carter on multiple projects as a valuable asset in ensuring his cooperation.
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** So... let&#39;s get started. Well first off they wanted to know what you were thinking about when it happened? They&#39;re probably trying to see if it has a thought based trigger or something.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** (//Silence//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** Joseph?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** ... They&#39;re gonna lock me away, aren&#39;t they?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:**  You know that&#39;s not really for us to decide.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** (//Silence//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** Look... I can&#39;t say for sure what will happen, but I know cooperation makes things go a lot smoother. I mean best case scenario, we figure out how to undo this mess. And even if that doesn&#39;t work out you will probably get some say in what they tell your family. But, I can&#39;t guarantee any of that if you don&#39;t talk to me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** ... When I was a kid, my father took me to the Grand Canyon. It was breathtaking, I had never seen anything so open and free. To this day it&#39;s one of my favorite places to visit. I was hoping to take Lizzy there one day. (//Pauses//) That&#39;s what I was thinking about.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** I see. Um... last time you were explaining to Dr. Tyler how you experienced a rush of memories, did that happen again?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** Yeah, it didn&#39;t feel like it was quite as much information as last time though, so it was easier to sort through it all. At first I didn&#39;t realize it was happening again, but then I noticed how silent it was. When I tried talking no sound came out. I started to panic and pace around the room, but then it just ended, and suddenly I was hit with another headache.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** From what we can gather from the scans you seem to be undergoing spontaneous periods of rapid neuron growth, which seems to be what&#39;s causing the headaches. The current theory is that your brain is forming these memories all at once whenever these incidents end.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** Well that explains why it feels like it all happens at once.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** By chance, did anything else stand out to you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** ... When I was panicking I tried to calm myself by taking some deep breaths, but I realized that I wasn&#39;t breathing. No air was entering my lungs, not that it would have mattered as my lungs weren&#39;t moving anyways. My entire body was just... numb. Even my heart wasn&#39;t beating. All I could feel were my own thoughts.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** Yet you were still capable of moving around?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Carter:** It didn&#39;t feel like moving, not once I started paying attention to it. I could get my legs to move but it took deliberate thought, as if I was switched into manual. And even then I didn&#39;t feel the ground below my feet, or any actual sensation of movement.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** Well I believe that&#39;s all the questions we have for now. They will let you know of any developments and decisions as they happen.
&gt; 
&gt; (//Dr. Langman gets up to leave.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** And Joseph, there&#39;s still a chance that if they can fix you they can use amnestics to let you be with Lizzy again.
&gt; 
&gt; [END LOG]
On 02/26/2006 Dr. Carter was classified as SCP-5715.[[footnote]]At this point in time the anomaly was believed to be an isolated effect tied to Dr. Carter. Following the discovery of SCP-5715-2 and the development of a better understanding of the component parts of the anomaly, Dr. Carter was reclassified as SCP-5715-1.[[/footnote]] Original containment procedures are stored within Temporal Site-02&#39;s database and may be accessed with Level 4/5715 clearance. 

Note: Dr. Langman was unauthorized to make the claims she did at the conclusion of the interview, however as it had a markedly positive effect on SCP-5715&#39;s willingness to cooperate with Foundation personnel no actions were taken to reprimand her.

**Addendum 5715-2: Discovery of SCP-5715-2**
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Access Post Event-5715-07 Files&#34; hide=&#34;Close Files&#34;]]
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Andrew Wittenbrook
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-5715
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** On 04/07/2006 SCP-5715&#39;s anomalous abilities activated while they were in transit between their cell and a testing room. They were later found hiding underneath a table in the site cafeteria. 
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wittenbrook:** So what exactly happened? Was this event as particularly long as last time?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715:** … No, it wasn&#39;t anywhere near as long... Its just...
&gt; 
&gt; (//SCP-5715 falls silent.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wittenbrook:** Please continue.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715:** ... I saw something.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wittenbrook:** What do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715:** When I realized that another event had started I looked around the hallway, and right on the back wall was this blotch of... it looked like static. At first I thought something was wrong with my head, some weird side effect of the headaches, but then it moved.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wittenbrook:** The static started spreading?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715:** No, it was more like it was emerging from the wall. At first I thought it was fixed in place, a visual glitch, but as it started to pull itself through I realized it had volume to it. It was this amorphous blob of static... but it still looked flat.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wittenbrook:** And what exactly did this blob do?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715:** It was just swaying in place in weird jerky motions. I had no idea how to react, and I was too scared to stare at it directly. Yet I couldn&#39;t bring myself to move either, I didn&#39;t want to draw attention to myself. Me and that thing sat there for what felt like a couple hours, and by that point I figured it wasn&#39;t gonna move, so I thought about making a run for it, but then it started to rush towards me. I ended up running through the site until I reached the cafeteria. I ducked under one of the tables hoping it wouldn&#39;t notice me. A few seconds later it was over and you guys found me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wittenbrook:** I see. That&#39;s quite a lot of new information we will have to process. I&#39;ll let you know if we have any further questions.
&gt; 
&gt; [END LOG]
The following day Dr. Wittenbrook admitted SCP-5715 for a series of CT scans and meetings with on-site psychologists, believing that SCP-5715 was suffering from visual hallucinations.
[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Access Post Event-5715-15 Files&#34; hide=&#34;Close Files&#34;]]
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Molly Langman
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-5715
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** On 07/19/2006 SCP-5715 alerted site security that an individual named Angela Fisher, an alleged member of site staff, had vanished immediately following the occurrence of an SCP-5715 Event. Initial investigation found no record of an Angela Fisher under Foundation employment. Upon being informed of this SCP-5715 refused to speak further with interviewers, requesting that Dr. Langman conduct the interview instead. After some deliberation the request was eventually granted.
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** So... how are you feeling? They’ve noted in your file that you are handling the memory rush a lot better now.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715:** So I&#39;m assuming you also read how Wittenbrook thinks I’ve lost it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** He worded it a little differently than that, but yes, I saw what he said.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715:** And?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** And what?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715:** Do you think he’s right?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** ... I don’t agree with his theory. It makes sense on a surface level, but the evidence just doesn’t support it. He’s arguing that the increased brain activity is causing you to experience hallucinations, yet for some reason you&#39;ve only experienced symptoms whenever time freezes? Seems like he’s reaching to me. Not to mention that your scans don’t turn anything up. (//Pauses//) However, there’s still the Angela Fisher situation.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715:** So you really don’t remember her?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** I’m sorry, no. (//Pauses//) Could you tell me about her?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715:** I didn&#39;t know her all that well. I&#39;m pretty sure she worked with humanoids, though that&#39;s not all that surprising considering we&#39;re at Site-17. Her work didn&#39;t have much overlap with mine but I do remember a couple years back she had to consult with some of our people about some assignment of hers. Not that any of that matters, its not like you&#39;ll suddenly remember her.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** Well no, probably not, but the way I see it there are still some important options to cover. First would be that Wittenbrook is right and the time stops really did mess with your head. Second would be that Angela has gone antimemetic on us, which still leaves some very important questions, such as why you can still remember details about her. And perhaps the most important option to consider: Angela did exist, but now she doesn’t.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715:** ... As in a localized CK-Class Event.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** It’s a possibility we should look into to. Assuming your memory wasn’t affected we may be able to find a discrepancy between what you should know and what you actually know.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715:** We should also check my work history with the Foundation. If the restructuring was retrocausal in nature, as I’m starting to suspect, it’s very likely that there are now differences in the history of people who interacted with Fisher.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** I’ll request the files and some other materials so we can get started.
&gt; 
&gt; [END LOG]
On 07/19/2006 Dr. Langman initiated an official investigation into a possible CK-Class Restructuring Event related to SCP-5715. Dr. Langman requested several devices from Dr. Anastasakos, the head of Project Kairos, and control over the containment procedures of SCP-5715 for the duration of the investigation. All materials as well as permission to conduct tests on SCP-5715 were approved, however control of containment procedures remained under Dr. Wittenbrook.
[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Official Findings of Investigation 5715-01&#34; hide=&#34;Close Files&#34;]]
On 09/03/2006 the following message was sent by Dr. Langman to Site-17 Director Weathers as well as Dr. Anastasakos.
&gt; **FROM:** Molly Langman
&gt; **TO:** Site Director Weathers; Dr. Anastasakos
&gt; **SENT:** 09/03/2006
&gt; **SUBJECT:** [URGENT] CK-Class Restructuring Event Confirmed
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; Having concluded my investigation, I can now confirm with utmost certainty that a CK-Class Restructuring Event has transpired. You will receive my full investigation report upon its completion, however due to the nature of my findings I have elected to send a summary in this email, as I believe it is imperative that this information reach high command as quickly as possible.
&gt; 
&gt; Initial interviews with SCP-5715 turned up several discrepancies between recorded history and the history SCP-5715 remembered. Notable examples of events not correlating to recorded history include:
&gt; * The existence of a Foundation employee named Angela Fisher
&gt; * The start of SCP-5715&#39;s Foundation employment in 1996 (records show 1999)
&gt; * SCP-5715&#39;s assignment to a project centered on studying retrocausal loops (though such studies have been conducted by the Foundation, our records do not show that SCP-5715 participated in them)
&gt; * The assassination of U.S. President George W. Bush on 05/10/2005
&gt; Though the majority of these discrepancies could not be confirmed to have been true through interviews alone it is of note that SCP-5715 knows accurate personal information about Dr. Chance Johnson, a former Foundation researcher who retired in 1998. According to SCP-5715, Dr. Johnson acted as a mentor and friend upon their joining of the Foundation. Our records would suggest that these two never met, and that SCP-5715 would not have access to this information.
&gt; 
&gt; Beyond this we were able to find quantitive proof to the existence of the creatures observed by SCP-5715. By using tachyon counters provided by Dr. Anastasakos, we created an array of detectors spread across Site-17. SCP-5715 noted the locations of these entities during the latest event; this information was then overlaid with the tachyon counter array. It was found that tachyon counters in close proximity to the creatures were detecting tachyon concentrations at least ten times the average.
&gt; 
&gt; However the most significant evidence found in support of a CK-Class Event was acquired from the files kept at Temporal Site-01. Access to the site&#39;s catalog was requested in order to find files that aligned with SCP-5715&#39;s version of history. Due to SCP-5715&#39;s previous status as a member of Project Kairos, files relating to their work may have been housed at Temporal Site-01. A quick search found that these causally isolated records corroborated SCP-5715&#39;s claims. Upon further inspection we were also able to locate proof of Angela Fisher&#39;s existence. A video of a seminar on dealing with humanoids with history altering abilities was deemed to be of enough importance to the RCT-Δt to be stored at Temporal Site-01. Angela Fisher was a facilitator of this seminar and can be seen throughout the video.
&gt; 
&gt; It has become apparent that the entities observed by SCP-5715 are not only real but capable of altering reality through means that have thus far gone undetected by our standard reality monitoring equipment. These creatures have already caused one CK Event we are aware of, and may very well have caused hundreds more in the past. This situation requires an immediate response from O5 Command and the RCT-Δt to formulate adequate containment procedures.

On 09/08/2006 SCP-5715 was officially reclassified as SCP-5715-1, the designation SCP-5715-2 was created for the entities observed by SCP-5715-1, and Dr. Langman was made a permanent member of SCP-5715-1&#39;s containment team.

**Addendum 5715-3: Containment Procedure Updates**

In response to the threat posed by SCP-5715-2&#39;s reality-altering abilities a series of discussions ensued to determine effective methods of containment. Proposals ranged from the neutralization of all instances of SCP-5715-2[[footnote]]Deemed impossible due to lack of effective termination methods.[[/footnote]] to the widespread implementation of XACTS Devices.[[footnote]]Denied due to [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2000 REDACTED]].[[/footnote]] On 09/24/2006 an outline for Temporal Site-02 was submitted to the RCT-Δt, which was promptly put into motion. Temporal Site-02 was deemed operational on 10/15/2006, through the use of temporal dilation and manipulation technologies.

-----
Protocol Veritas acts as the primary method of confirming an SCP-5715 Event as well as the best method of identifying any alterations caused by SCP-5715-2. This is achieved through the comparison of the most recently available backup stored at Temporal Site-02 and the current database. Any unaccounted for differences found between these iterations will result in the declaration of a CK-Class 5715-type Restructuring Event. 

Following confirmation of an SCP-5715 Event, Protocol Veritas will continue to scan and compare the two iterations of the database in order to find all new, altered, and erased SCP files. New files require no alteration or further action. Altered files will be reviewed and edited to incorporate as much accurate and relevant data as possible. Erased files will undergo review by Level 5/5715 personnel or O5 Command, in cases of high priority, to determine the feasibility of reestablishing containment. In the event that an anomaly is still extant, containment efforts will be reenacted as soon as possible, with records of its discovery being updated to match the new historical progression. SCPs found to be nonextant will remain unaltered within the database.

**Addendum 5715-4: Personal Logs of SCP-5715-1**

Following the development of new containment procedures it was deemed vital that more information on SCP-5715-2 be gathered. To this end SCP-5715-1 was tasked with recording their experiences and memories of SCP-5715 Events in addition to participating in regular interviews. The following is a series of selections from SCP-5715-1&#39;s journal and interviews deemed relevant to the nature of SCP-5715-2 or SCP-5715-1&#39;s mental well-being.
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Access Journal Entry, Section 1: 10/02/2006 - 11/15/2006&#34; hide=&#34;Close Entry&#34;]]
&gt; 10/02/2006
&gt; 
&gt; So I&#39;ve just been officially tasked with keeping a journal of the SCP-5715 Events. I&#39;ve never really been one to keep a journal, I always felt weird putting unfiltered thoughts on paper, but it&#39;s better than just sitting around not doing anything. Who knows, maybe learning about SCP-5715-2 is the key to getting me back to normal. I guess I&#39;ll just have to wait till time freezes again to find out.
&gt; 
&gt; -Joseph Carter

&gt; 10/06/2006
&gt; 
&gt; Fortunately it wasn&#39;t that long of a wait. Despite still getting headaches after each event I think I&#39;ve gotten better at remembering the details. Doesn&#39;t really change the strange sensation of only remembering your own thoughts and actions after the fact, but I do think I&#39;m starting to get used to it. Anyways, this marks the 26th SCP-5715 Event I&#39;ve experienced. It felt pretty short, around 10 minutes for my best estimate, though duration is usually one of the harder things to make sense of once its all said and done. 
&gt; 
&gt; I saw three instances of SCP-5715-2 (I should probably figure out a better name for them). The first was only partially sticking out of the ground so I couldn&#39;t get a good look at it, but it seemed to just be sitting there. I only managed to get a quick glimpse of the second one because it raced past me, heading west for who knows what reason. I ended up going to one of the courtyards hoping to find more, and that&#39;s when I saw the third one. It was floating in the sky right next to a bird, which disappeared when time started again.
&gt; 
&gt; Major takeaways:
&gt; * They seem to be free to move around space in whatever way they want, ignoring physical obstacles and even gravity
&gt; * As far as I can tell they can only affect things they are physically near when the event ends
&gt; 
&gt; -Joseph Carter

&gt; 11/15/2006
&gt; 
&gt; The irregularity in the time between events is starting to mess with me. It would be one thing if there was a way to predict how much down time I have, but as it stands the uncertainty of when I&#39;ll be thrown back into temporal limbo is keeping me on edge. There have been a couple of occasions where two events happen in the same day, and one particularly awful 48-hour period that had three. However, it&#39;s been about three weeks since the last event, and I think that was somehow worse. I couldn&#39;t stop myself from wondering when it would happen, and unfortunately I started to wonder if it would happen at all. 
&gt; 
&gt; The event itself was fairly mundane and short. I only saw one -2 the whole time and it just hung out by a rock that doesn&#39;t exist now. I really have no idea what these things are trying to accomplish. At first I assumed they were malicious but after seeing them delete a bird and a rock I&#39;m left wondering if they have any motives at all, or if everything they do is just random. I&#39;m really hoping that I&#39;ve missed something here, the idea of a collection of entities that alter reality for no reason at all isn&#39;t one I enjoy.

&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Molly Langman
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-5715-1
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** The following is an excerpt of the interview conducted on 12/03/2006 following Event-5715-32 as part of standard procedure. A full transcript can be accessed from Temporal Site-02&#39;s database.
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** Ok, so what about the &#39;dash-two&#39; entities? Did you learn anything new from them this time?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** You know how it took me almost two months before I saw a single instance?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** Yeah, that&#39;s probably part of the reason Wittenbrook called you crazy.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** Well it doesn&#39;t make any sense to me. Why is it that now I see at least one instance every time?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** What are you suggesting?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** I have no idea if I&#39;m somehow creating these things, or if they are just attracted to me, but one way or another it&#39;s my fault. I&#39;m the reason people like Angela Fisher are gone now. I mean, what if they keep erasing people? What if they erase L—
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** I&#39;m going to stop you right there. They haven&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** It&#39;s not like you would tell me if they had.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** She&#39;s what, nine now?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** Yeah, why?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** As far as the Foundation is concerned that information is useless, no reason to keep it locked up safe and tight in their big new fancy causally isolated database. So, if she really was gone, there is no way I could know that.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** I... thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** For?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** We both know that&#39;s the exact kind of information the Foundation would keep around to keep me happy and compliant. But thank you for letting me hope.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** ... You know, you should really start seeing your situation for what it is.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** And what would that be?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** These things were more than likely already messing with reality long before you showed up, getting away with it scot free, until you caught them red handed. Without you, people like Angela Fisher would be gone, without a single reminder that they were ever here. But, because of you, we can work towards making sure no one is forgotten like that ever again. So the real thanks should go to you.

&gt; 12/04/2006
&gt; 
&gt; I realize now that I&#39;ve been slacking. Despite knowing about these things since April the only real information I&#39;ve been able to gather is that they are fucking with reality. I&#39;m nowhere close to determining a motive, or what they hell they even are.
&gt; 
&gt; My main priority right now is to understand why their numbers are growing. I&#39;ve requested access to some of the data gathered by the TFMS. I&#39;m hoping that we have enough basic information by now to recognize some patterns and start eliminating some theories. I doubt they will give me much of the data they collected, but at this point I will take anything, I just need somewhere to start.
&gt; 
&gt; -Joseph Carter

&gt; 12/21/2006
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m still waiting for them to process my request for the TFMS data, which isn&#39;t all that surprising, it&#39;s not exactly standard procedure to allow an SCP to comb through classified information, even if that SCP helped design the prototype of the machine they&#39;re using to gather that particular information. I&#39;m fairly certain that if it wasn&#39;t for Molly intervening on my behalf I would have a lot less agency and ability to help in neutralizing my anomalous abilities.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite the lack of progress on that front something did come up that I needed to write about. I don&#39;t usually spend a lot of time observing any one particular instance of -2, I try to find as many as possible, and then I just stop paying attention to them once I note anything they are near. However, during this last episode I decided to spend as much time observing a single -2 as possible, just to see if I could pick up any new behaviors, maybe find something that I missed.
&gt; 
&gt; I ran into a -2 pretty quickly, it was hovering through the hallways, but it didn&#39;t really stand out from the others in any special way. I started to follow it around, keep my eyes on it, and I also started to focus in on the static. It was practically unnoticeable at first but the longer I focused on it the more the static started to calm, the chaos slowed, it looked more cohesive, more... real.
&gt; 
&gt; However, while the static calmed the actual entity became more chaotic. Its shape changed rapidly as it expanded and contracted in unnatural pulses and it moved in jerky unpredictable motions. It looked like an animal in pain, thrashing out against my gaze. I don&#39;t know how I know all of this, but it wanted me to stop, to look away, to release it from my perception. The longer I looked the more pain it felt, and the more I could understand and hear it. I was approaching some kind of threshold, and I don&#39;t know what would have happened if I crossed it. I ended up looking away out of fear.
&gt; 
&gt; I can still hear it screaming.
&gt; 
&gt; -Joseph Carter

&gt; 01/05/2007
&gt; 
&gt; I got the data from the TFMS last week, and have been going through it since. Between that and the general paranoia of wondering when the next event will happen I haven&#39;t gotten much sleep recently. Luckily I can say that the sleepless nights have payed off. Since the tachyon counters are spread across the globe (and evidently there are even some on the moon) we can track the general movement of -2 instances by comparing tachyon concentrations between events.
&gt; 
&gt; If I was somehow creating these things then they would be diverging away from me over time, spreading out across space, however, we see the opposite. These things are converging towards me, slowly closing in on me from the depths of space. As terrifying as that sounds it&#39;s actually somewhat relieving to finally know something definitive about them.
&gt; 
&gt; The working theory is that the -2 have been around longer than I have, presumably wandering the universe, stranded in no-time, messing with a world they aren&#39;t even fully a part of. Then I come along and get myself a time-share in temporal limbo and suddenly they want to meet the new resident. I have no idea how it is that they sensed me, but evidently even atemporal static beings aren&#39;t immune to curiosity.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m so close to understanding these things, I have to be. We already knew that they are non-physical, and now, knowing that they aren&#39;t just mindless husks, it feels pretty safe to assume they operate like I do when I&#39;m in there: just pure thoughts and consciousness. Biggest difference is that they presumably don&#39;t have a body to go back to when it&#39;s all said and done.
&gt; 
&gt; That still leaves how they got stuck in that hell. If I can figure that out, figure out how they exist like that, I can figure out how to free myself from it. Finally be allowed to go home, to be outside unsupervised, --to see my little girl, assuming she still--
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m tired. I need to sleep. I&#39;ll be able to think better after some rest.

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-5715-1
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Following an SCP-5715 event on 01/09/2007 SCP-5715-1 was found to be in a catatonic state. They spent the next 23 days in recovery. They were interviewed on 02/01/2007 to determine what transpired.
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;re alright.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** That&#39;s pretty informal of you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** What do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** Worrying about an SCP. Not very professional.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** Well, you may be an SCP, but you&#39;re also my friend. Besides its not like you are the first anomaly who has worked with us.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** An anomaly... you know I never realized how degrading that term could be. To imply that someone&#39;s state of existence is so unusual as to be considered wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** You know I didn&#39;t mean it like that.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** (//Silence//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** Joseph, come on.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** (//Silence//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** Fine. Can you at least tell me what happened?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** ... Did you read my journal entries?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** Of course, it&#39;s part of the job.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** Well, like I mentioned in the journal I thought I was close to figuring out the &#39;dash-two&#39;. It felt like I was just missing one final detail that would make everything click, and then I could finally free myself. The only problem is that I had no idea how to find that last piece of the puzzle.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** ... But I&#39;m guessing you eventually came up with something.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** Yeah, a stupid idea I was desperate enough to try.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** What did you do?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** I realized that me and the &#39;dash-two&#39; have access to one another&#39;s consciousnesses, or at least there is nothing stopping us from taking a look inside. That&#39;s how they were able to sense me, and that&#39;s how I was able to hurt one just by looking at it for too long. We can&#39;t affect one another physically, especially since physicality means nothing to the &#39;dash-two&#39;, but we can interact with one another&#39;s thoughts.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** So what, you guys are all just telepathically linked?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** Not exactly. If you think of the mind as a house then telepaths are effectively breaking and entering, usually having to put in effort to do so, but during the events it&#39;s as if all the doors are unlocked and all you have to do is walk inside.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** So what exactly did you do with this revelation?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** I walked inside. I looked at one of those things till it started screaming again, except this time I didn&#39;t look away. I let myself cross that threshold I was scared of last time.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** What did you see?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** I couldn&#39;t understand most of it. A combination of images and ideas that don&#39;t fit into the human mind. Memories of a world so alien to ours that even the simple things looked wrong. Concepts that don&#39;t exist in our universe. But hidden between all that chaos were emotions that I recognized: so much fear, dread, and longing. You know, they used to live normal lives, or at least more normal than the infinitesimal existence they have now.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** What happened to them?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** Something came, or maybe it was Nothing? I don&#39;t have words for it. All I know is that It came and they had to run. Eventually they had no choice but to escape and hide somewhere else. They were confused though and they didn&#39;t understand the rules here. They ended up burrowing themselves deep into time itself, and now they are stuck.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** How are you even sure of any of this?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** Because I felt it on a fundamental level. It wasn&#39;t just some hallucination or mind trick. I felt their longing: they desperately want some semblance of the lives they used to have. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** What about their retrocausal abilities? None of that explains how and why they are messing with history.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** They are intertwined with time, they could theoretically change it however they see fit. The only reason they haven&#39;t made our reality a cacophonous mess is because they don&#39;t want it to be. There is purpose in the choices they make. Painstaking trial and error, all to push existence in one direction. They needed something from the physical world to latch onto, something more real that could help pull them out. Do you know what that makes me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** (//Silence//)
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** (//In elevated voice//) I&#39;m just a goddamn fucking tether! It doesn&#39;t even matter if I find a way to fix myself because if I ever try to pull myself out they&#39;re gonna come up with me. The only way ...
&gt; 
&gt; (//By this point Agent Garland, who was overseeing the interview, deemed SCP-5715-1&#39;s aggressive behavior as a potential threat to Dr. Langman and called in security to terminate the interview, sedate SCP-5715-1, and return them to their cell//)
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** ... I can become normal again is by screwing up time itself. I&#39;m forever gonna be an SCP, living my life in a cage, and I didn&#39;t even get the chance to say goodbye to my daughter. I spent years paying more attention to this goddamn job than her, and now I can&#39;t even fix my mistak—
&gt; 
&gt; (//Security agents enter the room and successfully sedate SCP-5715-1 removing them from the room//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** (//Whispers//) I&#39;m sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; [END LOG]
Following this interview it was determined that enough information had been gathered about SCP-5715-2 to no longer warrant the aid of SCP-5715-1 in determining their origins. As such, on 02/02/2007, the current iteration of containment procedures were enacted.

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-5715-1
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** On 07/15/2007 SCP-5715-1 requested an interview be conducted citing a &#34;necessary change to current containment procedures&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Langman:** It&#39;s been awhile since you agreed to participate in any interviews, much less personally request one. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** I needed time to think about things.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** Of course. You seem to be a doing a lot better now. So, what exactly did you need to talk about?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** ... You need to amnesticize me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** I&#39;m sorry, what?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** The Foundation needs to wipe my memories from before I became an SCP.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** I don&#39;t... why would you ever want us to do that?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** I recently found out that, like the &#39;dash-two&#39;, I can phase through matter during events. Turns out physical obstacles don&#39;t mean much when you&#39;re just thoughts. The only thing that was holding me back before was that I was subconsciously restraining myself. I could just walk right out of whatever containment cell you put me in.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** Why are you telling me this? If you had left, then we would have never realized. You&#39;d be written off as another casualty of the &#39;dash-two&#39;.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** Consider it my last act of service to the Foundation. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** That&#39;s bullshit and we both know it Joseph. If you&#39;re going to try to go and get your entire life erased, at least give me the courtesy of telling me why.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** You&#39;re right that it would be too easy for me to just walk right out of here. Even if you guys did eventually find me I could just leave during the next event. I&#39;m sure they&#39;d find very creative ways to keep me locked up eventually, but the simplest way to keep me here is take away my motivation for leaving.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** Elizabeth.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** I could only stop myself for so long before I tried to go and see her. I&#39;d want to tell her how sorry I am for paying more attention to work than her. To apologize for leaving her so suddenly, without ever getting the chance to say goodbye. Or even just the chance to tell her that I love her one last time. So the threat of me breaching containment is very real, but the truth is I&#39;m terrified that if I went looking for her, she wouldn&#39;t be there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** But to forget about her entirely? Could you really go through with that?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5715-1:** Molly, I spent a long time thinking this over, it&#39;s not a decision I make lightly, and I&#39;m having a hard enough time just saying it out loud. But I have to, because I can&#39;t spend the rest of my life fearing that she&#39;s gone.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Langman:** I... understand. I don&#39;t see my superiors having any problem with your request, so you&#39;ll most likely be escorted to the site&#39;s medical wing sometime in the coming days to receive your amnestic treatment.
