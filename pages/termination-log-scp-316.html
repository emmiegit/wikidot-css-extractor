**Location: [[[decomm:scp-316-d|SCP-316-D]]] Containment Facility**
&gt; **Clef:** So you&#39;re SCP-316?
&gt; 
&gt; **316**: I prefer to be called Dyne the Unfettered.
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Dyne, huh? That short for anything?
&gt; 
&gt; **316:** No, just Dyne.
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Cool. Well, I&#39;ve been going over your file, and I have a few questions to ask you.
&gt; 
&gt; **316:** Please go ahead.
&gt; 
&gt; [DATA EXPUNGED]
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** &lt;laughter&gt; Ain&#39;t that the truth. Anyway, this looks good. Looks like we won&#39;t have any problems.
&gt; 
&gt; **316:** Thank you very much doctor.
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Call me up sometime, I&#39;ll buy you a beer.

**Post-Incident Interview 316-Clef**
&gt; **Interviewer:** When was it that you realized SCP-316&#39;s true nature?
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** It was when I was doing my rounds. I noticed that. . .
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** One moment. For the sake of posterity, please clarify what you mean by &#34;your rounds.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Oh, right. Well, after the [[[decomm:scp-531-d|SCP-531-D]]] incident, I was asked to take over evaluation of the other humanoid SCPs. I guess with my experience, the bosses figured I had a good nose for sniffing out humanoid Scips that needed to die. . . anyway, I figured that 316 was your average superhuman, when I realized something weird, walking out of that first interview.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** And what was that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** I liked him.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Is that strange? SCP-316 is. . . was. . . a likeable guy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** I don&#39;t like ANYONE at first. Especially not Scips. Anyway, that raised my suspicions, so I studied his file a bit closer, and noticed something strange. He&#39;d had favorable contacts with every problematic human SCP on file, from Able to Saint, all positive. . . even Able for crying out loud, and that sociopath REALLY doesn&#39;t like anyone.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** It was then that you determined that you had been compromised.
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Yes. But I needed proof too. I wasn&#39;t going to make the same mistake I did with [[[SCP-239]]]. So I decided to make a small test.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** You mean the fencing match?
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** I mean the fencing match.

**Location: Dr. Clef&#39;s Office**
&gt; **Kondraki:** Hey, Clef, what&#39;s up?
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Not much, Konny. How did the fencing match go?
&gt; 
&gt; **Kondraki:** Great! He kicked my fucking ass, but it was all good. I got one touch on him, that&#39;s all that counts.
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Really. And Whaddya think about Dyne?
&gt; 
&gt; **Kondraki:** Awesome guy. We&#39;re gonna go again next week. Why the questions?
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Just curious. Hey, I had a question for you about this year&#39;s personnel evaluations.
&gt; 
&gt; **Kondraki:** Sure.

**Post-Incident Interview 316-Clef**
&gt; [BACK]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** And the significance of this was?
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** You know I fence too, right? Saber and Foil. I don&#39;t fence with Kondraki, though, because the last time I did, I beat him by one touch in a 15 point match. He took off his mask and threw it against the wall, and insisted on an immediate rematch. Draki&#39;s a really sore loser, and he&#39;d just smilingly accepted a loss from a complete stranger. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** That was when you decided to terminate SCP-316?
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** That was when. But I couldn&#39;t make the same mistakes I did with 239. I needed to do this subtly. . . not break in willy nilly and botch the job. That&#39;s why I recruited a bunch of relative unknowns instead of going to established and respected SCP Foundation personnel.

&gt; Re: Personnel Evaluations
&gt; 
&gt; Please report to my office at the first available opportunity.

**Post-Incident Interview 316-Clef**
&gt; **Interviewer:** This was when you proceeded with Protocol Nineteen?
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Correct.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Please explain Protocol Nineteen, for the record.
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Protocol Nineteen is a method for terminating difficult subjects, especially those with protective psychic barriers. I was inspired by the method the Foundation used to retrieve [[[SCP-668]]]. In any case, it relies on a simple method: each individual carries out a single step in the termination sequence. Alone, each step is not dangerous or fatal to the target. However, when carried out in tandem, the effects are terminal.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** And what sequence did you use to terminate 316?
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** I would rather not say.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Why not?
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** A good poker player never shows his hand. I may need this ace up my sleeve again at a later time.

**Location: [[[decomm:scp-316-d|SCP-316-D]]] Containment Facility**
&gt; **316:** Did you really think that would work?
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** I was kind of hoping it would, yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **316**: Your betrayal hurts me. More, though, I am amused by the fact that you believed that you could even hope to best me in a sword fight.
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** On second thought, yeah, that was a bit silly of me, wasn&#39;t it?
&gt; 
&gt; **316:** I could kill you any time. . . but I think I&#39;ll do it slow. Watch you as I cut you apart piece by piece. Who knows? Maybe I&#39;ll even enjoy watching you fail.
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** I didn&#39;t fail. . .
&gt; 
&gt; **316:** . . . what?
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** This sword fight isn&#39;t meant to kill you. It&#39;s meant to distract you.
&gt; 
&gt; **316:** *laughs*

**Post-Incident Interview 316-Clef**
&gt; **Interviewer:** And this was when your backup attacked?
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Yes.

-----
**Surveillance Log x316███, Date █-██-█████-██-████**
**Location: [[[decomm:scp-316-d|SCP-316-D]]] Containment Facility**
&gt; **316:** You fail again, Clef.
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Damn. 
&gt; 
&gt; **316:** Did you really think that I would not notice your cronies attempting to attack me from behind? Your cowardly tactic has completely failed to. . .
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Shut up.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;gunshot&gt;

**Post-Incident Interview 316-Clef**
&gt; **Interviewer:** And that was when your hidden sniper took his shot?
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Can you please state his name, for the record?
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Who says it was a he?

**Surveillance Log x316███, Date █-██-█████-██-████**
**Location: [[[decomm:scp-316-d|SCP-316-D]]] Containment Facility**
&gt; **316:** . . . aaaaagh! My leg!
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Hurts, don&#39;t it? Even that&#39;s going to take you some time to heal. And I don&#39;t plan to let you do that.
&gt; 
&gt; **316:** You sonovabitch! I&#39;ll kill. . . 
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Hit him again.
&gt; 
&gt; [more gunshots. screaming.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** You made a mistake, Dyne. You thought I only had one backup plan. The truth is, I came in here ready to terminate you any way I needed to. If it came down to it, Ice would press a little red button that would set off the on-site nuke. Any means necessary.
&gt; 
&gt; **316:** You asshole! You&#39;ll never get away with this! I&#39;ll heal any wounds! I&#39;ll come back from. . .
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** I don&#39;t think so. Gibbons, hand me the lobotomizer.
&gt; 
&gt; **Gibbons:** Here, boss.
&gt; 
&gt; *SLAM*
&gt; 
&gt; **316:** AAAAAGH!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Do you feel that, 316? That&#39;s the feeling of a railroad spike being driven into your skull by a pneumatic hammer. It&#39;s penetrated your frontal cortex and destroyed most of your higher brain functions.
&gt; 
&gt; **316:** . . . aaaaaaaaagha. . . 
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** You&#39;re going to regenerate that wound. It&#39;s going to heal up around the spike. But that part of your brain is never gonna grow back. Neither is this part here. . . *SLAM*. That&#39;s your brain stem. That was supposed to control your motor coordination.
&gt; 
&gt; **316:** . . . ngggggggggggh. . .
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Let&#39;s see. . . what else should we mess around with? How about the heart? *SLAM* And the spine *SLAM*. And, just because you pissed me off, here&#39;s one for your balls. *SLAM*

**Post-Incident Interview 316-Clef**
&gt; **Interviewer:** So. what is the current situation with SCP-316?
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Terminated.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** How so?
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** We threw what was left into a hidden compartment in NASA&#39;s Hermes space probe. In about a week or so, that probe is going to have a malfunction on the way to Jupiter and plunge into the sun.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** And if he somehow manages to regenerate his lost functions even after that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Who the fuck cares? How is he going to get out of the sun&#39;s gravity well? And if he wakes up on route and breaks out, he&#39;s going to be on a parabolic path straight into the sun anyway. Newton&#39;s third law: you need a reaction to get some action, and he doesn&#39;t have enough re-mass to break out of his suicide orbit.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** I see. One quick question.
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Shoot.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Is there any reason why you chose to personally lobotomize the subject using a railroad spike driver? It seems that the sniper could have done so from a distance.
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Therapy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Please explain.
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** I don&#39;t like being manipulated. I especially don&#39;t like having my head messed with. Doing the honors myself was good for my soul.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Remind me never to piss you off, Doctor.
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Don&#39;t worry about that. If you do, you&#39;ll never know.
