Honestly I never know what she&#39;s thinking.  Emotional openness is not Varga&#39;s deal.  But on the positive side, she&#39;s basically ageless.  Been a Director since the mid-80s and she&#39;s looked roughly 45-55 years old that whole time.  Skeptical to a fault, but that makes sense in the position.  Quietly fierce, protective of her agents, and inscrutable.   Rating two stars based on being totally clueless as to who she really is.

Nice library though.

**Edit:** She can&#39;t read these right??

This guy is potentially the kindest man I’ve ever met. He genuinely cares about all of his employees, but my god the shit he gets into during his research would scar a torture-trained navy seal. How this guy can read, research, and publish pieces about some of the most disgusting, horrifying things and come out the other end asking if people want to get donuts with him is insane. I hope he’s okay. There’s not a lot behind those eyes.

Nice enough guy, but when they promoted him to Director he divided all the Site personnel into three teams and assigned us an elaborate competition with different scorings and points. It wasn&#39;t clear if it was like an icebreaker or a team building exercise, but no one really worked on it. We all just kind of ignored it while doing our regular routines. He stopped talking about it after a month and I can&#39;t tell if he forgot or is just self-conscious about the thing and doesn&#39;t want to bring it up.

I told him I was former US military on my first day and he would not stop asking me about boats. He has an entire filing cabinet dedicated to pictures of military boats. Probably tens of thousands of them. I told him I was Army and didn’t care for boats or the navy and he called me a shit-eating heel. Haven’t had a word with him since.

I remember my first day like it was yesterday. Me and this other guy were getting onboarded, and the other guy stumbled onto something that was a &#39;teachable moment&#39; sort of deal, so she took him aside and I guess they went on some sort of adventure! Anyway that guy died horribly because the floor became invisible name-eating cockroaches or something -- this was during the adventure, //inside the Site!// -- and she got a bruised ankle or something, and now there&#39;s a hole in the universe where the guy used to be, but you can still sort of hear him screaming if you take expired mnestics.

She is //intensely// unprofessional in every interaction.

**Edit:** I have been informed that the individual described above is not in fact Director McInnis. I amend my review: he is //intensely// unprofessional in every interaction. He swears every other word, he is //constantly// mocking the guy who does replication studies, he never leaves the archives and every time you ask him a question you can see him choking down a joke about your word choice. Also he looks like if Santa was homeless.

He&#39;s not a bad dude overall — he knows what he&#39;s talking about around 99% of the time. His weird fasination with esoterics is my main problem. I had to do some grunt work on his files when I was interning at 43. I had to keep making trips back and forth to the library to get the definitions of what a &#34;Sapientia&#34; means. He wouldn&#39;t let me take the reference out of the library because I &#34;had to learn them this way.&#34; Pretty good at proof reading though.

Sirius Reverend once cheated a djinn into giving him unlimited wishes. I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s against the Theological Ethics Code of Conduct but after seeing him tear a daemon in half with his bare hands I dare not to report him. Those eyes have seen things no mortal should, and I fear the day that they may fall upon me and regard me with anything less than respect.

He doesn&#39;t even use the wishes, by the way. He cheated the djinn just to prove he could.

Awful. I’m pretty sure he only hired me because my personnel file said I was in Gamblers Anonymous. Constantly tried to provoke me into betting more than he knew he paid me. Which is next to nothing.

Strong and engaging presentational skills, however you informed people twice within 2 minutes that they had 7 minutes left to finish their current task. I suggest using a timer in the future to avoid making simple errors like that, as they reflect poorly on your organizational skills.

As neither a scientist nor a professional administrator of any kind, Director Ostrander contributes very little to Site-232&#39;s internal operations. She has however advanced our mission inestimably, and has so far given me no reason to believe that I will be forced in the near future to employ highly experimental and untested Ontodimensional-Interstitium-Manipulating technologies in an attempt to decommission her, should such a thing even be possible. Also she might be able to read this right now. Before I even send it, I mean. Maybe before I typed it? Five stars.

I went to Ivo’s office for what he called my “orientation” and he was just sitting there in this black leather executive chair, back to the door, staring out the window. It was cloudy outside, always fucking cloudy. The walls were covered in these artifacts—relics and paintings and diagrams, I don’t know. I didn’t get a good look at anything. His desk was this rich mahogany monstrosity, the kind with eighty drawers and sub-compartments, and on top is this white, almost crystal skull of some kind of sea animal. I got into 184 for a thesis on deep-sea crabs, but if I had to guess I’d say it was some kind of porpoise. Ivo pulled something out of the desk—a turquoise billiard ball—and set it gingerly down. He said I was to take five minutes before bed each night and stare into it, then I had to sleep right away. Make sure it’s the last thing I do every day. He gave me a number to call the following morning if I had the dream. He said I’d know the one.

A thoroughly uncomfortable experience. This guy couldn&#39;t write his bulletin memos more purple if he tried. He went to the beach once and he thinks he’s Lovecraft or something. 2 stars.

I was writing up our annual report on containment procedurs -- those of you in the field will know what a time crunch that is -- and Vincent walked into my office (well, my cubicle. shared cubicle), and told me he had something more important to do. When I tried to protest he unplugged my computer (technically just the monitor) and took it to his office. He came back with a stack of about 3,000 pages of paper. Apparently the printer malfunctioned overnight and printed off a document with the names, age, blood type, and &#34;likelyhood to give their lives for Vincent Bohart in an emergency situation&#34; of Site-333&#39;s employees nonstop. He told me I was promoted to &#34;Secure Document Destruction Specialist&#34; and responsible for dealing with it. Then he handed me these:

I&#39;ve worked under O5-1 for the last twenty years. He was an old withered shell of a man when I first met him and he has somehow become even smaller. I think it is from the hate keeping him alive — hate is very dense and pulls your skin in close. He&#39;s a good boss, though. We rarely do any work. He prefers to spend his days in some sort of meditative exercises, keeping the worries of the outside world away.

Last week we went down to the river for three days. We spent the entire time in waders, water up to our knees, fly fishing in the creek. I&#39;d almost think the water would knock him over, the man is so small, but he stood there, up to his waist and didn&#39;t capsize. O5-1 insisted that he gut and clean all the fish we caught himself, and I was in no hurry to tell him otherwise. They made for a delicious meal.

But when we returned to Site-01, he told the other Overseers that he caught a fish this big, and stretched his arms out to their fullest. He lied. I caught that fish. A star falls from the heavens.

One of my colleagues pissed him off with some joke I can’t remember at this moment. The next day he gets his lunch and it’s been replaced with slugs. The day after his entire office was filled with slugs. Like an inordinate amount. Think of a lot of slugs in a confined area and then triple it. Fucking psychopath.

One Christmas he made an announcement he was going to &#39;Mr. Beast&#39; everyone in the Site. We walk in the next day and the entire third floor was gutted and replaced with a large, red, crudely spray-painted circle and he forced us to stand within its perimeter to win &#34;way too much money.&#34; After around an hour two people were literally sucked through the floor and were nowhere to be found. We found out afterward that since we&#39;re bordering with Hell they thought this was an offering. I won the money which is why he gets an extra star.

From my first day, the Director has been watching over me. Sidling around a corner, oozing in a nearby toilet, and squeezing through the emergency ventilation ducts, her ocular pseudopods stare wide through their nictitating membranes. She often tries to comfort us recently-arrived researchers, bringing us into a warm embrace and congratulating us on our &#34;clean vibrations&#34;. After offhandedly mentioning my overpowering homesickness to the other personnel in a sealed experiment chamber, no sooner had I returned to my chambers than I discovered an envelope, filled with illicit surveillance photographs of my closest kith and kin, replete with looks of complete happiness and ignorance of their observers.

However, the Director must improve in her treatment of the meeting rooms. Whenever she uses them, the chairs are ripped open, the table is scuffed and warped, and the biscuits taste very sticky and wet inside our mouths.

But last week we were investigating ghosts at the Jackson Sloth Memorial High gym, and I mentioned how much I hated gym class as a kid, and I resultantly spent the rest of the night trapped in the utility closet by ghost jocks while my team members were forced to play an endless game of ghost basketball to the //Space Jam// theme song. I got us out of there by pointing out that we were a visiting team, since none of us ever attended JSMH, and the ghost jocks were all using retired numbers which are unacceptable in extramural play. They still gave me an atomic wedgie on the way out. Felt like complete shit about it, and the next day Bailey promotes me because I &#34;had my own POV episode.&#34; So //I don&#39;t know.//

Pros: He’s a visionary. His projects are universally successful, and his work will be remembered for generations. For a 98-year-old he is surprisingly sprightly.

Cons: Working with him can be gruelling. He is not the most communicative of directors, so when he makes you do one hundred fucking takes it&#39;s a little hard to see how well it&#39;s going. That, plus the exhaustion from one hundred fucking takes doesn&#39;t help much. Also he goes on and fucking on about the moon landing and faking his death. You&#39;d think he&#39;d be a little more wise to confidentiality.

Bit of a weird character. Started off really fun, literally everyone wanted to talk to him and he always had something fun to say. The higher ups said they wanted to bring him in to help team exercises, but after a while he just kept on spouting these really weird comments. Not too fond of most groups it turned out. For some reason the computer whizzes kept dragging him in and out of the aic workshop, must have messed with his head a little. Anyway I haven&#39;t heard from him in ages, hope he&#39;s alright 

**Edit:** Saw Genai recently, couldn&#39;t understand a word he said, he was acting like he&#39;d only learnt English yesterday, but at least he&#39;s less problematic. Might have to make it two stars just for that.

On the seventh of every month, the Site receives its monthly supply of provisions. On the seventh of every month I receive a request from the director for three 1 gallon jars of Sysco mayonnaise delivered directly to his office. On the sixth of every month his secretary sends the three jars from the previous month back to the kitchen. They are always scraped clean. Once, a jar had the wrapper of a chocolate mint inside it, the type that would be on a hotel pillow. One time I sent light mayonnaise to him and he screamed at me for fifteen minutes.

No one told me when the Foundation left the Lucky Star Diner. I just came to work one day and they were tearing down the entire building to make way for a minigolf course. I didn&#39;t have the personal contact information of any of my co-workers or a way to get in touch with management. I hadn&#39;t heard anything about it one way or another. I ended up questioning the last several years of my life: had I really been working for a secret non-government institution? Was the anamolous real? I became obsessed, drove my family and friends away, started breaking into buildings throughought Atlantic City, glancing over my shoulder every day expecting to see some shadowy figure stalking me; had they meant to amnesticize me and forgotten? Would they come back to finish the job?

This lasted for about a year. Then I realized I was still receiving bi-monthly payments from &#34;SCPF_333&#34; on my banking. Turns out they just forgot to tell me. I got an email directing me to this site in my personal account this morning. I&#39;ve not worked a single day for them in the last decade, and they just keep sending me money.

Vincent, wherever you are, fuck you. And thank you.

He&#39;s alright. But there was this one time I went to his office to pass him some papers and caught him wrapped in a giant cocoon-like a sleeping bag. It was gone the next time I stopped by but his office is now full of moth terrariums. I think I see his face on their wings.

The first time I met Mr. Doe was at 3 AM in front of my house. I looked out the window and saw him floating in the distance, bathed in harsh light. Feeling like I was hallucinating, I called my roommate, but he had already disappeared.

The next morning, I heard a rumor that &#34;the dead who were wronged will return as a spirit of vengeance.&#34; Recalling the events of the previous night, my heart started pounding and I vomited from stress. I ran out of the building and when I looked behind me, I saw his vulgar eyes watching me. He knew what I did.

Other than that, he&#39;s a pleasure to work with. Funny guy!

Every week I have to log on here and say something like &#34;come on guys, that&#39;s enough character assassination, this is the guy who got Belphegor //the Prince of Sloth// to sign the Undervegas Labour Pact&#34; or &#34;alright, don&#39;t overplay the supervillain angle, he only spends so much time staring out the big windows at the night skyline with one hand behind his back and the other adjusting his Illuminati tie-clip while he chuckles softly because he knows you&#39;re watching and he likes to put on a show,&#34; and I&#39;m getting sick of it. Yes, okay, at my interview he asked if I could beat him up, and when I said I didn&#39;t think so, he didn&#39;t want to hire me. Yes, //sure,// you can trace a line of causation from him shouting &#34;Look what I can do!&#34; and the death of Mother Teresa. And I&#39;m not denying that his unfamiliarity with the names of the Seventy-Two Demons in the //Ars Goetia// nearly started an interdimensional incident when he was unexpectedly introduced to Count Furfur. And then Duke Vapula. And then King Purson. I had to force him to fake a stomach cramp by punching him in the gut before he met President Amy and got us all killed, and he specifically cited the punch in my next performance review as &#34;hotter than hell, and I speak from authority.&#34; But on the other hand... yeah, I honestly can&#39;t remember where I was gonna go with the opposite side of this argument.

Overall a good colleague. His work on the SIMULACRUM has paved new paths of research into thaumaturgic anomalies without needing to sacrifice nearly as many junior reserchers. However, his frequent inappropriate outbursts and proclivity towards deleting all of our progress whenever a janitorial staff member looks at him funny //has// made his genius difficult to work with at times.

A wonderful person inside and outside of the workspace. My only issue is that they’re terrible at hiding when they’re pissed off. You can always tell when Faran’s having a bad day because they address everyone as “author” in a very respectful but spitting-on-your-boots tone. Great brownies also.

It is so cool to be here doing science and containment at this site. I love to work with all of my scientist and buddies and Director Grange who is my boss (in this hierarchy we all enjoy) is great at telling us what to do with all of our time. I am the kind of scientist who loves to know important secrets about foundation and I enjoy sharing them with all of my colleagues at Site 138 because we are all given clearance to share our favourite secrets about anomalies and the foundation. There aren&#39;t any issues here and we love to kill anomalies every week for our entertainment as a staff exercise, and we all get paid to do fantastic things like keep real people hostage. I love my job here and I encourage anyone to write an application for transfer to Site 138 to No. 38 Ophidia Lane, Three Portlands and TELL NO ONE AT YOUR CURRENT SITE to give them an awesome surprise when you transfer.
