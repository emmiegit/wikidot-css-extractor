**September 2nd, 1902:** People can be so unnecessarily cruel sometimes. I know this is a public passenger car and all, but that doesn’t mean you can be loud the whole way through? Is it just common courtesy, you know? “Treat others how you want to be treated.” I’m not going to cause a commotion over it, though. I don’t want to look like the bad guy and all.

**September 5th, 1902:** The train finally arrived in Istanbul. I don’t know how much more I could have taken sitting in that thing. I made some revisions to my writing during the trip, so I guess that’s a silver lining.

**September 9th, 1902:** The professor did not like “Ghost of Tomorrow” I had put my heart and soul into writing this piece. He claims it lacks “stakes” and “emotion.” That is just untrue! It is so emotional! 

However, he did say that it has some potential. I mean, of course, this piece has potential! I made it with my sweat and tears! Regardless, I guess I am new to the field at the professional level. Failure is just one step towards success. 

I can make this better. I know I can.

**September 27th, 1902:** How are people not seeing the beauty of my work? I guess it might not sound as engaging on paper but on the stage. On the stage, it would be a masterpiece! They would soon seek forgiveness for their initial distaste. 

Damien said he thinks “Ghost of Tomorrow” is good, though. So at least I have him to assure me that the greatness I see in the writing is not a simple delusion of mine.

**October 10th, 1902:** What am I not seeing here? My classmates seem to be learning from the lectures. Are they hearing something different than I? Like yes, I know the basics and everything; I get the idea of “Chekhov’s gun,” but like beyond that, the lessons feel nonsensical. I don’t think these professors are worth the floor they stand on.

**October 31st, 1902:** My academics are going along fine, yet I don’t feel like I’m learning anything. I listened to Mr. Brelitrov’s advice and stopped trying to make “Ghost of Tomorrow” for now. He said something along the lines of, “there are always other paths you can take. Don’t get stuck in a rut, or you might lose yourself.” He’s probably right; I’ll need to take a different approach if I want my work to meet the standards of the greats. 

Aren’t my works good enough already?

**December 19th, 1902:** I got good marks during that first semester, but I don’t know how I did it. I don’t think I learned anything. My scripts were still looked down upon, and even [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2273 |Mr. Beletrov]]] didn’t believe they were any good either. 

Well, being back at home has given me time to think. As I played with Tarik in the backyard, I believe I’ve finally come up with a solution to my problem.

**March 7th, 1903:** Maybe the professors are right. Emotion was lacking in my scripts. The actors can never express the emotions I want them to convey. Why can’t they just say as I say? Do as I do?

Nevertheless, I know he will understand soon enough. What’s important right now is having them both perform at once. This has proven difficult, it’s extremely taxing on my mind.

**April 13th, 1903:** My creative genius is finally being recognized! I am getting top marks in all of my classes this semester. I guess all I needed was a little push. I am unique after all, I have my quirkiness, so that explains why I needed to do hands-on work to better my writing. 

Controlling Cassandra and Damien at the same time feels almost impossible! I can’t control them both at once. It’s so hard. I need to think of other approaches.
