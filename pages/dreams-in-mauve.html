Dr. Romero had been enduring the stress of the office environment for several days after being relocated. He felt surrounded by piles of documents, files, and colleagues speaking in technical and scientific terms. This was somewhat bothersome to him because he believed that constantly using that formal language made people seem robotic, disregarding the human factor. He had been transferred to Site-12 in Devon due to his extensive and respected track record at the Foundation. Since his adolescence, he had dreamed of visiting England, especially the Devon and Cornwall area, partly fascinated by the mythology and folklore of the place. However, he found it impossible to engage in tourism in those Celtic lands due to the overwhelming workload assigned to him. This frustrated him immensely, and the only moments of freedom he had were the few hours left for sleep. When moving from Miami, he only took the essentials, except for a book he was allowed to keep after a raid conducted by the Foundation in a residence occupied by Scarlet King cultists, who were under the Foundation&#39;s surveillance. The book was titled &#34;Dreams in Mauve&#34; and had been written by an Irish author named Grant S. Kennedy. It was a rather peculiar text, difficult to classify as academic, novel, or essay, due to its dreamlike nature. Every night, before sleeping, he would read a couple of pages and easily drift off, not out of boredom, but because the content of the book, inherently poetic, made him daydream and wander to the point where sometimes he couldn&#39;t tell if he was still awake, which, in a way, relieved the stress caused by the relocation.

At first, he enjoyed the inspiration and musings that reading the book brought him, but over time, the dreams and visions became increasingly bizarre as he progressed in the reading. The book seemed to explore the dream content as a literary genre and from an academic perspective. It spoke of a world that could be accessed through dreams, where any action taken there could have an effect in the physical realm. The book approached this subject from an occult perspective, particularly related to the English occultist Aleister Crowley. Romero had read a lot about Crowley in his adolescence, and the fact that he had shown interest in the occult at that age had served as a kind of curse or blessing, leading him to become a member of the SCP Foundation and hold an important position to this day. The dreams provoked by the book became increasingly incoherent, and upon analyzing them while awake, they made no sense whatsoever. However, during the dream, everything seemed real and possible.

Weeks passed, and during that time, Romero delved deeper into the world of dreams. There, he developed a different life, another identity, and everything that came with it. He had friends in that world, and it all felt so real. However, upon awakening, he experienced emptiness and frustration that flooded his heart with sadness, often leading to silent tears.

One night, on October 13th, Romero had a dream that completely changed his life in the physical plane. In the dream, he was sleeping in what appeared to be a country inn. Upon waking up in the dream, he saw a small lizard and a snake at his feet, but instead of feeling disgust or fear, he felt at home. He descended to the ground floor, where Chandraputra awaited him, a sage he had met during one of his many journeys in the dream world. Romero, known as Achad in that place, mentioned to Chandraputra the presence of the reptiles in his bed upon waking. Chandraputra, straightforward and direct, explained that it was the definitive sign that it no longer made sense to cling to that illusory reality he called the &#34;Real Life,&#34; and that the egregore that inspired and powered that world he

called the &#34;dream world&#34; had provided him with a space to be free. They headed back to the room, where the lizard and snake had been, now replaced by small fluorescent blue larvae. Achad didn&#39;t fully understand, but Chandraputra placed them in vials and told Achad that they should make their way to the Oracle of Hypnos, not far from the inn. Without hesitation, they set off on the journey.

Upon arriving at the Oracle, Chandraputra opened the vials and released the larvae into a nearby lake. As he did so, an entity with the appearance of Romero in the &#34;Real Life&#34; manifested, but enveloped in a black aura emanating from his entire body. He seemed burdened and sad. He gazed at Achad, and Achad did the same, then approached him peacefully and with a redeeming essence. Facing his own self, Achad observed that shadowy figure without feeling fear. Guided by a cosmic impulse, he embraced it. In doing so, he felt his entire life as Dr. Romero pass through his mind like a film, gradually experiencing feelings of depersonalization. He couldn&#39;t perceive the passing of time while embracing that figure, but he didn&#39;t have to, as he found himself in the Dream World. In an instant, the figure dissolved into a violet dust that, as it fell to the ground, dissipated and became indistinguishable. Achad lost all emotional and spiritual connection to what had once been and felt free and willing to stay there forever, living a life where he was embraced by those who, perhaps, had been stifled by the demands of the modern Western world, just like him. He left with Chandraputra towards the inn, while the egregore watched over him from an even more remote area, feeling happy about Achad&#39;s integration into the Collective.

At Site-12, people noticed that Dr. Romero hadn&#39;t gotten up and wasn&#39;t present at breakfast, despite having many pending tasks. Concerned about the behavioral changes they had observed in their colleague over time, they went to check on him in his room. Upon entering, they found Romero in bed, eyes closed, with the book &#34;Dreams in Mauve&#34; by his side. He had torn out a page from the book, and he had also cut out an excerpt that read as follows:

//&#34;In the ether of dreams, where the awakened soul resides,//

//The Children of Oneiroi dance, crafting uncertain tides.//

//Freedom in apparent death, catalepsy of the soaring self,//

//In Morpheus&#39; vast embrace, life unveils itself.&#34;//
