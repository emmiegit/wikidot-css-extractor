SCP-7000

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to its original habitat, SCP-7000 cannot be moved from its original location. Foundation agents and researchers within the Ministry of Environment and Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia are to be stationed at Balong Keramat Darma Loka site to monitor all of the remaining species of SCP-7000 under the guise of endangered animal protection conservation site. 

Due to an increasing amount of trend embezzlement because of SCP-7000&#39;s popularity within the local community. Any unauthorized personnel or locals that are attempting to access the Darma Loka conservation site are to be met with force. 

**Description:** SCP-7000 are a collective designation of 53 //Tor douronensis// that are located in Darma Loka conversation site, Kuningan, West Java, tentatively known by the local community as Kancra Bodas or God&#39;s Fish due to its ties with the famous King Siliwangi.

When consumed, SCP-7000 will start to give its subject the ability to manipulate probabilities subconsciously. The subject had a higher chance of success when proceeding doing any daily activities that are involved with probabilities, with a higher chance of the desired result to be happening in the subject&#39;s favor. This includes a small activity that includes probability elements to it, such as flipping a coin, which would always land on the same side based on what the subject desires. Even if the subject didn&#39;t intend on getting the desired result, it would give the subject the result that is deemed as the best result.

Its anomalous properties could be seen a few hours later if the subject consumed SCP-7000&#39;s meat, with the effect wearing off once the meat within its subject&#39;s body had completely digested. Consuming its meat continuously would stack the anomalous properties within the subject&#39;s body, with the longest effect recorded wears off after 104 hours by just consuming SCP-7000&#39;s meat three times a day for two days.

**Addendum: History**

Jaya Dewata, also known as Prabu Siliwangi, was born in 1401 in Kawali Galuh, or what is today the Ciamis region. He also goes by the name Prabu Dewataprana Sri Baduga Maharaja, as stated on several recently discovered inscriptions. The father of King Siliwangi was Prabu Dewa Niskala, a descendant of King Niskala Wastu Kencana, who ruled the Sunda-Galuh Kingdom from 1348 to 1475 AD.

When King Siliwangi was in charge of the Pajajaran Kingdom, he was at the height of his power. The Pajajaran kingdom was always in a condition of peace and order under his rule. Protecting not only its people from that region but also the nature surrounding it.

King Siliwangi resides at where the current local community would call his final resting place as Darma Loka, in which where he meditates and took care of every animal within the Javanese forest that he is famously known for Kancra Bodas (God&#39;s Fish), Maung Bodas (God&#39;s Tiger) and many other animals that are indigenous to the region.

SCP-7000 is first mentioned in the passage that had been written by King Siliwangi itself that was found back in 1970 by the Indonesian government. With its content and the copy of the passage had been released to the public, which is currently stored at Sri Baduga Museum in West Java. Below is the translated version of the original passage written by King Siliwangi as transcribed by Head of Foundation&#39;s Linguistic Department, Miklos Rinewffy:

&gt; And as I gazed at the clear sky, the breeze of the forest’s wind hits my body. A disturbed flow of wind made me open my eyes amid meditation and behold, I saw a man walking in the distance.
&gt; 
&gt; He is a friend of mine, carried on his arm was a sack of water in one and another filled with fish.
&gt; 
&gt; He came closer upon noticing me, and so he began telling me how he was in a stroke of bad luck, for each day his catch dwindled in numbers and he couldn’t keep providing much more for his family.
&gt; 
&gt; I looked upon his catch and how I saw those fish still alive, then I asked what he’ll do next with it. He wished to cook this immediately for his family.
&gt; 
&gt; I objected to him and gave him the advice to spare them first. He firstly refused, but I insisted and he was finally willing to listen to what I advised.
&gt; 
&gt; I took the fishes from him and set them free on my pond. And I rehearse what I said to him, for he is to be patient and let them live until they bear their offspring. And as for tonight, I gave his family my rice sack enough for tonight.
&gt; 
&gt; He became a diligent man. Taken care of the fishes on the pond and for that, I gave him his reward every day.
&gt; 
&gt; Soon the pond filled with fishes, what once started with only have few. And when one finally died after so long, I gave it to him.
&gt; 
&gt; I told him, eat this and any other fish when their end has come and you and your family shall be prosperous for the rest of your life.
&gt; 
&gt; He did what I told and everything happens as I told him, he and his family now live a prosperous life more than he could ever imagine.
&gt; 
&gt; And now I’m writing this for the future generation. To spare living beings, to live along nature. I will keep guarding nature for I am-
&gt; 
&gt; 
The rest of the passage cannot be translated as the original paper was lost and torn due to its aged condition. But it was the first historically recorded documentation of King Siliwangi&#39;s salutary interest toward the animals in the Javanese region, compared to the most famously known counterpart of it the Maung Bodas or God&#39;s Tiger.

Due to its popularity within the finding of King Siliwangi&#39;s writing, there was an uprising trend within the local communities from the Javanese region to hunt down every animal that is in the Javanese region. It was believed by the people that the animal that was taken care of by King Siliwangi had a &#34;magical&#34; effect that would increase their luck. This was known by one of the locals that tried to eat the fish that are in the Darma Loka site and had their lifestyle grown exponentially.

People started not only hunting down every ray-finned fish or //Tor douronensis// that were in the Javanese region. This was none other than by some people that are trying to use SCP-7000 for their own personal consumption to increase their luck for gambling, which had grown very popular during that time in Indonesia.

[[include component:image-block name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Panthera_tigris_sondaica_01.jpg/800px-Panthera_tigris_sondaica_01.jpg|align=right|width=50%|caption=Last image known for Pantera tigris sondaica or A Javanese Tiger.]]

The Indonesian government had issued a drastic action to protect SCP-7000&#39;s from the public, preventing any local communities from hunting and killing all of the fish. While this was effective, but the public averted their eyes towards the Javanese Tiger or //Pantera tigris sondaica//. The Javanese people believed that the Javanese Tiger was &#34;Maung Bodas&#34;, one of King Siliwangi&#39;s favorite animals, had &#34;magical&#34; effects just like SCP-7000.

This led the Javanese community to start hunting the Javanese tigers for the meat to be consumed, its tooth to be made as a lucky charm and its pelt to be used for fashion that was sold on the premises as &#34;Lucky Patterns&#34;. The local community most of the Javanese tigers in the region until its population were decreased exponentially, until its status was changed from least concerned to critically endangered until they were only 25 species left in the wild. 

The Indonesian government had made its own conservation site for the Javanese Tigers that was caused by the site-wide illegal hunting to protect its existence. But it was declared to be extinct in early 1990, due to the locals continued hunting of The Javanese Tigers while it was guarded by the government.

With the rising trend of gambling in Indonesia, the government decided to ban gambling entirely. Several Foundation agents embedded in the Indonesian government reported about the situation regarding SCP-7000. 

Both the Foundation and the Indonesian government came to an agreement to protect the existence of SCP-7000 under the guise of an endangered species. With the Indonesian government warrants heavy sanctions for both gambling and illegal hunting to this day.</textarea></pre>
