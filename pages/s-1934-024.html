= **__S-1934-024 PROFILE__**

**Subject:** Magical Artifact

**Ease of Supervision Rating:** Medium

**Hazard Rating:** High

**Standard Protocols of Maintenance:**
# Artifact self-contained within subterranean burial chamber at an undisclosed location.
# Burial chamber has been modified to include 25 living spaces for on-site practitioners, as well as a PA system.
# Basic food rationing for practitioners.
# Copies of digital media and literature are free upon request by practitioners. 
# Artifact must be inspected for damage by practitioners at the start of every month.
# Location has been secured, and Security Zone Jayfar-5 has been established around the object&#39;s resting place. Non-castrated personnel are to operate from this location. 
# This project is conducted in partnership with the [[[oria-hub|Office for the Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts.]]] This joint operation has been in effect since 1985. Authorized personnel may refer to ORIA Project 112 &#34;CHASTE IDOL&#34; for more information.

**Special Protocols:**
# Seized human resources (&#34;practitioners&#34;) will be sourced from ██████████████. Practitioners will be selected in accordance with standard protocol. All practitioners must be castrated at Area 4 prior to deployment at Security Zone Jayfar-5.
# Protocols as written in ORIA Document D.TDL24 have been ratified by the Ministry in the Artifact&#39;s containment. Methods of magic and occult ritual as described in D.TDL24 will be performed by 10 or more practitioners at a time. These practitioners must be in the presence of the Artifact at all times and must be closely monitored.
# 2 additional practitioners must permanently reside at Security Zone Jayfar-5 in the case that one either dies or is otherwise unavailable. Artifact does not register unconscious persons as present.

**Description of Subject:** 
Large spherical object of unknown origin or composition. 2.2 meters in diameter. Weight of 475 kilograms. Discovered by the Ministry in 1934. Previously under the possession of the British. Artifact was returned to its burial chamber by the ORIA in 1980.  Incapable of autonomous operation, however no means of ceasing the Artifact&#39;s effects has been discovered. 

Composed of a currently unknown type of phaneritic igneous rock (speculated). Along with this material, traces of iron (13.4%), beryllium bronze (48.1%), and phosphorous acid (3.041%) have been recorded by mass spectrometers. Artifact emits heat at 30 degrees celcius. 

Artifact is perceived by practitioners as a young African boy. Apparently, this entity is always reclining on a golden altar or table in the place of the sphere. A minority of practitioners perceive the entity as wearing regal attire, however the majority observe the boy as naked.

Historical records suggest that the Artifact was once situated upon an ornamental bronze/copper mantlepiece, possibly constructed during the Rashidun Caliphate: this object is currently missing. 38 additional non-anomalous Artifacts have been recorded by practitioners within the object&#39;s burial chamber. Initially discovered encased in a 28 cm thick [[[scp-1427|rhodium carbide shell,]]] however this has been removed and is currently stored in Area 4.

Humans who have not had their sexual organs removed will undergo hazardous cognitive alteration within the Artifact&#39;s presence: all activities associated with sexuality and childbearing will become highly traumatic to the victims to the point of self-mutilation. It has been found that this process is achieved through an electromagnetic pulse emitted by the object once every hour. Subjects whose minds have been altered by the Artifact will express favor in the prospect of joining the ranks of its practitioners, often requesting genital mutilation. Atheistic subjects exposed to the Artifact have professed their faith in God afterwards. 

Exposed subjects will claim to become a member of a &#34;third class&#34; of citizen, akin to slaves or serfs. The subject&#39;s self-worth will additionally be destroyed. Subjects have an unusual fear of performing autonomous actions, and require permission from the Artifact&#39;s perceived owners in order to perform any sort of activity.

If the Artifact is not surrounded by castrated human subjects at all times, it will seek out victims on the surface. Artifact must be tended to at all times. This is vital to its suppression.

Its practitioners advise against destroying it, as it may unleash a darker power or curse yet more terrible than the one we have presently observed. Based on the precedent against destroying objects of magic, we have decided to obey this command.

&gt; 1. The CHASTE IDOL is undoubtedly harmful to all life. Dr. Mohammadien&#39;s observations of the Barid Jinsiana monks has confirmed their ritual&#39;s viability in containing the CHASTE IDOL&#39;s anomalous influence. The Organisation will assume the role of managing willingly castrated participants, as well as the original monks, in the CHASTE IDOL&#39;s confinement. The Organisation&#39;s collaboration with the monks is also an asset to research of the southern Arabian peninsula concerning similar artifacts which have been discovered.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. The magical ritual of the Barid Jinsiana used in order to suppress the influence of the Sphere has been enacted probably since the weapon&#39;s relocation to ██████████ in the Sultanate of Oman, where it was buried. Specialized volunteers who have been castrated before having ever had penetrative intercourse and pledged to a life of celibacy are to be assigned to the care of the artifact at all times. At least 1 of these volunteers must be present and awake at all times with the artifact, but at least 10 must be present and awake with the artifact once a day.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Previous to the British acquisition of the artifact, it was cared for by an early iteration of the Barid Jinsiana. They describe the object as a young black boy. According to them, the artifact or entity is motionless at all times, reclining upon his bench. It is known within their organisation as &#34;the Golden Child.&#34; Outside interactions with surfacing monks should be kept to a minimum, as they are volatile, possibly having been affected by the Sphere in some other way. The Barid Jinsiana should never be restrained, and encouraged to spend as much time awake and with the artifact as possible. This has a drastically marked effect on the emissions of the artifact, reducing the potentially lethal emissions to almost zero. As long as this equilibrium is maintained, the artifact is harmless.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. This method seems to be the most reliable way of containing the object&#39;s power. The practices of the Barid Jinsiana are indeed ancient, possibly originating from pre-Islamic Southern Arab faith, and have been preserved by various entities&#39; repeated employment of the monks and volunteers, both willing and forced, some of which who would inevitably become monks themselves, that this cult has been preserved throughout history. The earliest mention of the cult&#39;s utilization was during the Roman-Persian Wars, when the Sphere was captured by the Romans and used against Parthian soldiers. The monks, whom the Romans called //castratus,// and their cult was moved to Crete, where the object was once again buried. The location of this chamber is unknown to the Organisation. 
&gt; 
&gt; 5. The placement of earth over the Sphere is speculated to be of additional significance to its suppression. However above-ground ritual occupation has never been tried, it has become a tradition of the Barid Jinsiana to bury the artifact along with their treasures, and they have been known to become agitated when made to do otherwise. For the purpose of seamless cooperation with the monks, their wishes should be respected.
&gt; 
&gt; 6. In general, the protocols of the monks of Barid Jinsiana are best upheld by the Organisation, as cooperation with them is the most inexpensive and direct method of containment. Their methods have been proven over the millennia, and the Organisation, as well as the allied Omani Ministry of Magic, are equipped to secure a volunteer force willing to undergo the necessary procedures for its maintenance.
&gt; 
&gt; 7. This memorandum drafted and transmitted 14 June 1980.

= __**HISTORICAL EVALUATION**__

The Artifact traces its heritage to the land of Oman, for as often as it has been appropriated by the hands of foreign powers, it has also remained within the hands of the Sultan twicefold. The Sultan of Oman&#39;s Armed Forces reserved the right to the Artifact in our military should it desire, however the Ministry should advise against it. The Artifact&#39;s Omani heritage is rightly recognized by our allies, the ORIA, and various partnered agencies of the paranormal from other Arab nations.

Professor Ahmed bin Bahla of Muscat University first identifies the Artifact in historical records in a 5th century account by Achaemenid general Anoshiruvan during a patrol of the Maka satrapy, presently the northern portion of the Sultanate. At the time he commanded a party of 30 warriors and magi on a mission to survey and possibly seize various magical items from the native population. Anoshiruvan recounts that 27 of his soldiers encountered a tribe of Arabs in the vicinity of present-day Yanqul: all of them had been driven to a state of total servitude to the tribe. Later, Anoshiruvan and his remaining men would again encounter a caravan of Arabs in the night. He was approached by the Arabs, and was presented by a cloth which contained the severed penises of his men. Anoshiruvan decided against pursuing the tribe, as he believed their magic to be too strong, and the expenses of the battle to be too great. This event has been linked to the Artifact. 

Ancient reports of soldiers encountering a dark force in southern Arabia and exhibiting similar characteristics of demoralization and genital mutilation suggest frequent use of the Artifact in warfare. The Artifact was moved to Persia in 115 BC, as recounted by King Antiochus VIII Grypus of the Seleucid Empire: while in Syria, a loyal tribe of Arabs presented the Artifact to him, accompanied by 20 naked men (perhaps early Barid Jinsiana) who had had their penises removed, which nullified the Artifact&#39;s transmission. The men and the Artifact were donated to Antiochus, and it was purportedly used in the 116 BC civil war between Grypus and his brother Cyzicenus, though actual evidence for this is scant.

The Artifact was seized by the Romans in 1 BC and used for war in the Near East. Use of the Artifact in war is unrecorded beyond this point. It would change hands several more times, from the Romans to the Byzantines, and then the Venetian Republic (which is possibly linked to an incident involving the genital mutilation of 12 men and women in Venice), and was then gifted to Sultan Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi of the Omani Empire in 1756. Ahmad contained the object in its present burial tomb, but in 1798, Sultan bin Ahmad would gift the object to the British East India Company for supposed use in India. In 1948, the Artifact was returned to Oman when India become a proper British colony.

= __**INTERVIEW WITH VOLUNTEER &#34;FARFOUR&#34; REGARDING THE ARTIFACT**__

&gt; __Present:__ Dr. Dhaki bin Hadi, Subject &#34;Farfour&#34;
&gt; __Date:__ 06-06-1999
&gt; __Foreword:__ Subject &#34;Farfour&#34;, whose actual name is not disclosed out of respect for the Barid Jinsiana, is a willing volunteer of our containment program for the Artifact. Before, he was a member of the Area 3 Science Team, however due to personal circumstances he decided to volunteer for the maintenance of S-1934-024 in 1998. During his time in servitude, he has successfully assimilated into the Barid Jinsiana monks, and has become a legitimate member of their order. One year after his enlistment, Dr. bin Hadi requested an interview with him in order for us to better understand the reasoning of the Barid Jinsiana.
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Subject&#39;s reasoning as to why he volunteered for castration have been removed from this transcript in respect of Dr. bin Hadi&#39;s specifications&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. bin Hadi: Why do you care for the object?
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Farfour&#34;: It is a child, sir. It must be taken care of, or else it will hurt itself.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. bin Hadi: That&#39;s not how we see it. Before your initiation into the order of the monks, you agreed with us that what was in the cave is a spherical object. Why now do you see a child?
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Farfour&#34;: Initiation into his mission lends a new perspective on things, doctor. I myself can&#39;t explain it. When the child accepted me, and agreed not to maul me, he opened himself up to me and presented to me a child dressed in raiment. I knew from the first day that he was a beautiful child, and that it was my responsibility to parent him.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. bin Hadi: Are you still aware of the mission assigned to you by the Ministry?
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Farfour&#34;: I haven&#39;t forgotten.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. bin Hadi: You know what the child is capable of? You know why you and the monks must contain it?
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Farfour&#34;: His power is terrible, doctor, but he is a pure and innocent child.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. bin Hadi: That doesn&#39;t matter to the Ministry. For all intents and purposes, the object is a hazard. But I am straying from the topic at hand. When you were initiated, when and how did you first come to the conclusion that this was your responsibility?
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Farfour&#34;: I knew it from the moment I entered with my genitals removed. The cave became my home, and the monks my people. It is a natural process. This is my natural position. The child created man and divided him into three sects: the men, the women, and the slaves.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. bin Hadi: Do you still believe in God?
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Farfour&#34;: I do. I see him every day in that cave.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. bin Hadi: So you believe the child is God, then? 
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Farfour&#34;: That is a difficult question to answer, sir, since the definition of God is so obscure. There are many entities that your Ministry deals with that could be considered gods. Why did God create them? Did He create them, or are there other powers greater than just the one God?
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. bin Hadi: I&#39;m having a hard time understanding you. So you&#39;re saying there is more than one God, and that your child is one of them?
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Farfour&#34;: There is no God, doctor. There are magical beings, and some beings are more powerful than others. Humans are at the bottom of the chain of magic, and the humans that the child mauls are even lower than that.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. bin Hadi: That&#39;s an awfully nihilistic view.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Farfour&#34;: To me, the mere existence of the child is proof. You created a whole Ministry to be level with magic. There are countless paranormalcy organisations who try. But none have succeeded. I&#39;ve worked in this field long enough to know that we can&#39;t match up to magic. We are ants on our anthills, and we refuse to acknowledge that there are far bigger creatures who would stamp us out. The child is one such creature, and the child is kind to us.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. bin Hadi: The child drives men to insanity, &lt;CENSORED&gt;; it turns us into its slaves. 
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Farfour&#34;: But the child does no such thing! Doctor, the child guides us to the truth. There are men who are not worth continuing their legacy. There are dead chains for every generation. The men who go to war and die are destined for death. The child helps us to realize that, doctor. You must understand. The child is merciful to us.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr bin Hadi: Based on our research, the child only converts people to this destiny. There have been good men who have been ruined by that thing. Are you saying that every man exposed to its magic is destined to die by it?
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Farfour&#34;: It is destiny. No man can know it. 
&gt; 
&gt; Dr bin Hadi: Very well. Thank your for giving me this opportunity, &lt;CENSORED&gt;. Your sacrifices have greatly aided our cause.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Farfour&#34;: Thank you for leading me to him, doctor. Now I am at peace.
