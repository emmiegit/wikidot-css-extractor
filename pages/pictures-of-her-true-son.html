He shakes his head 

at a shelf 

stuffed full 

of faded plastic bouquets

shuffles down

past smeared

once-beaming poster boxes

pushing runny lotion 

and greasy banquets

his pack

covered with patches bleached

cut

from blackened tarp fabric

bobs

against bustling morning traffic

hands caressing 

the steaming plastic tops 

of mugs of coffee

and sleek metallic cups 

mated with ears

fixated only on the voice 

from within

chattering.

-

He had been 

a bombardier 

during the war. 

Manicured hands

drew numbers from a bowl

pasted

across the wavering lines 

of the television

sending him

stumbling away 

from the cinder-blocked hedges 

of home

thrust into 

a dizzying, frenzied world

where engines scream

streaking high above 

stagnant canopies

before their gleaming bellies

are ripped apart, by blooming spores

celebrating death

to which his response

was flipping a switch

sending barrels plummeting

through radio cackles 

relaying figments

final howls

of strained prayer

from

the men on the ground

clutching sobbing families

sheltered

under flimsy thatched ceilings

waiting

for incineration 

from the heavens.

-

He had tried 

desperately 

over the course 

of so many 

bloodshot nights

to wash

the spores

their cries

sticking to his pores

in a gasoline, incense 

streaked crust

all away. 

First it was the soothing burn

of the corner store’s cheap gin

stinking of 

lukewarm juniper and malt

then

crushed salts

trickling down from a paper packet

onto a tarnished spoon

held over a sputtering flame

before being tapped

at the press of a plunger

pricking his facade

with a silver stalk

feeling the crust 

slipping away

into a muddied 

euphoric 

haze

coursing deep

through beaded convulsions

across 

fraying veins. 

-

When he stops

before the mead 

of peeling, pockmarked benches 

the pack thumping down 

to rest

out escapes 

a

labored

racking 

breath

as 

withered

waxing 

eyes

cast themselves up 

to the departure board

watching

through the peephole

a sticky, shimmering bokeh

the destination tickers 

take flight.
