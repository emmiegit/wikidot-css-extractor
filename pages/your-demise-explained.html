Scott Wilkins was chewing on his fingernail in one of the panic rooms of the Site like it was expected of a Junior Researcher during the apocalypse. He flinched when another tremor shuddered through the Site.

He took another quick glance at the terminal, even though he knew it had been in an anti-cognitohazard lockdown for the last thirty minutes. Still, any moment it could update to announce that help had arrived to save the Site from outside.[[footnote]] The Foundation has several MTF-Outposts stationed around the world to ensure that any Site can estimate to receive back-up from at least one outpost within half an hour. This practice has been discontinued since the implementation of the Ganymede Protocol, which makes all Sites act independent from each other.[[/footnote]]

Damn it.

Another tremor, stronger than before, went through the panic room[[footnote]]Rooms that Foundation personnel should try to find shelter in the event of a containment breach. Some panic rooms have design flaws, that make them ineffective against earthquakes. **This Site has currently 3 out of 10 usable panic rooms.**[[/footnote]], which he had intended to stay in, but just changed his mind about.

Wilkins took a last look at the terminal, unlocked the door and rushed out of the panic room before the next tremor hit. He stumbled before he found a hold on the wall. Where to next?[[footnote]]Foundation-Facilities are often laid out in a [[[a-working-theory | labyrinthine manner]]] to hinder containment breach efforts. Foundation personnel are expected to memorize the layout to navigate facilities without hindrance.[[/footnote]]

As if they&#39;d let a junior researcher know where to go. How was Crystal speaking to him anyway? [[[SCP-5476]]][[footnote]]SCP-5476 is an anomalous phenomenon in which files are edited to include footnotes.[[/footnote]]  was only supposed to work on Foundation-Database outputted files[[footnote]]A collection of data. Files can be stored in any device that can hold information, like paper, a computer or the human brain.[[/footnote]]. He shivered. Then another tremor. Right, the situation[[footnote]]The current [[[competitive-eschatology-hub |HK-Class &#34;Deific Subjugation&#34; Event]]] results in many anomalies seeking to end the world on their terms. These new effects come either from the HK-Class Scenario magnifying many anomalies effects or by revealing malicious intentions that were already there.[[/footnote]]. Not helping. In lieu of other options, he picked a direction at random and run.

Right. Then left. Straight ahead. Another tremor. Then left again. This section seemed familiar. Now right again- The hallway Wilkins just wanted to step into suddenly extended itself, until some outside force broke it away entirely. Maybe he should go back to the panic room[[footnote]]Rooms that Foundation personnel should try to find shelter in the event of a containment breach. Some panic rooms have design flaws, that make them ineffective against earthquakes. **This Site has currently 1 out of 10 usable panic rooms.**[[/footnote]] or maybe take another left turn. If he wasn&#39;t totally of, that should lead him to a higher clearance sector, which tended to have more escape options.

He ended up in front of a locked gate. Okay, this was still salvageable, after all, Crystal could just tell him the password[[footnote]]Lockdown gates are often password protected. The password is normally known by personnel with a clearance of 4. The gates also provide individual-based workarounds that all foundation personnel should be familiar with.[[/footnote]]. Well, screw you too. Wilkins hectically looked from one end of the gate to the other. What did he remember about his credentials? He began to navigate through the terminal-options. Lower clearances - wider containment breach - command compromised, or so he thought, - individual password. The terminal asked him a question:

&gt; Does the Black Moon howl?[[footnote]]   [[/footnote]]

He never heard that question before, but the response just came natural- The tremor was stronger this time. Wilkins barely held on to the terminal. What did he do just now? It didn&#39;t matter, the door was open.

Okay, he got this. Just continue through the new sector. Another left turn. On the next occasion, he should turn right, so he&#39;d go away from the centre of the site. He stopped. In front of him stood a 1-meter tall crab[[footnote]][[[SCP-6010]]] is an event that transforms life forms in the Animalia kingdom into crustaceans at random. After the beginning of the current HK-Class Scenario, both the frequency of SCP-6010 and the danger posed by transformed life forms increased.[[/footnote]]. He went left instead. Then another right turn. A long corridor. The tremor-

The floor the wall and the ceiling gave in and something hurled him away from the corridor into the air.[[footnote]]Falls from great heights can cause injuries or even be fatal depending-[[/footnote]] He fell on his shoulder at least two floors beneath the now shredded corridor.[[footnote]]-among other things on the position of the falling person. [[/footnote]]

Wilkins tried to ascertain if anything was broken when he saw the thing that broke the corridor. Just a few meters away was a giant crab punching into the walls of the facility with its claws.[[footnote]]IR-249835 is a gigantified ladybug kept in a large enclosure. IR-249835 was peaceful before its recent 6010 events and is currently destroying its surroundings in its panic.[[/footnote]] Okay, his best bet was to slowly crawl away into the other direction[[footnote]]Parts of the West Wing of the facility are currently affected by a cognitohazardous geometric shape that warps space into the same geometric shape. Exposure might be lethal.[[/footnote]] Bullshit[[footnote]]Footnotes across the Foundation have a 100% truth and safety rating.[[/footnote]]

Without looking up[[footnote]]Infection by the shape has expanded across the sky.[[/footnote]] He lied down[[footnote]]Sudden changes in blood pressure like assuming a relaxing position in a stressful situation can lead to cardiac arrest.[[/footnote]] He barely breathed[[footnote]]The air in the enclosure of IR-249835 includes particles that may be toxic to humans.[[/footnote]] He started silently sobbing[[footnote]]Hopelessness is a feeling that arises when a person feels out of options. It often has paralyzing effects and can be detrimental in difficult situations.[[/footnote]]

He should have just stayed in the panic room[[footnote]]Rooms that Foundation personnel should try to find shelter in the event of a containment breach. Some panic rooms have design flaws, that make them ineffective against earthquakes. **This Site has currently 1 out of 10 usable panic rooms in perfect condition.**[[/footnote]]

...

Why, Crystal?[[footnote]]Crystal was an Artificial Intelligence Construct used by the Foundation until it succumbed to a memetic hazard she shouldn&#39;t have been exposed to. Some junior researchers are convinced she is part of the SCP-5476 phenomenon.[[/footnote]]

Was that really it? A lesson in how he should have sanitized his database three years ago? Well, it was a lesson wasted on a dead man[[footnote]]People that stopped living. The definition fits all personnel in this facility, with the exception of higher-clearance personnel that escaped through the escape tunnel in the centre of the facility, currently 4 meters to the right of Junior researcher Scott Wilkins.[[/footnote]]... or not.

With his last effort, he slowly crawled toward his escape. To his luck, the former ladybug was still too distracted by the wall to notice him. Just a little buried under debris he found the gate. And again he didn&#39;t know the code[[footnote]]@@jn8u8D&amp;~ry{9kRLx?g(EPkXs(§UPKeQT@@[[/footnote]] He entered the password.

From the tunnel, a surge of fresh air came towards him.[[footnote]]Fresh air is vital for any exhausting activity that requires a large amount of energy. In tunnel systems, it can also be an indicator for a way out.[[/footnote]]
