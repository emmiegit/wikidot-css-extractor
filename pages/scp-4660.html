[[include component:image-block name=SCP-4660-1.jpg|caption=SCP-4660-1]]

**Item #:** SCP-4660

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4660-1 is to be contained on-site at SCP-4660-3, within a Type S Mammalian Anomaly Containment Chamber. The chamber is to be inspected daily for attempts to breach containment. This chamber and the property on which SCP-4660-3 has been built is maintained by staff from [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-64|Site-64]]]. SCP-4660-1 is to be fed using an appropriate feeding schedule, with a veterinary physical examination to occur once monthly for any changes in SCP-4660-1&#39;s health.

SCP-4660-2 is to receive daily inspections for unsanctioned damage. All attempts to remove SCP-4660-2 have been indefinitely suspended.

**Description:** SCP-4660-1 is a female specimen of //Felis catus//.[[footnote]]Domestic Cat[[/footnote]] SCP-4660-2 is a pink collar made of an as of yet unidentified aramid fiber, affixed around SCP-4660-1&#39;s neck. SCP-4660-2 has an attached brass tag engraved with &#34;Buttercup,&#34; as well as a phone number.  SCP-4660-3 is a single story suburban home in Portland, Oregon.

When SCP-4660-1 expires or moves farther than a 50 meter radius from SCP-4660-3, it immediately vanishes, then reappears within SCP-4660-3&#39;s living room, causing a detectable spike in Elan-Vital Energy.[[footnote]]One of the components of aetheric energy, which powers all thaumatology.[[/footnote]] Any injuries sustained by SCP-4660-1 prior to this event will have regenerated with no signs of scar tissue or other trauma. SCP-4660-1 shows signs of distress while outside of SCP-4660-3 and will attempt to reenter the building. If no mundane means of entry are possible, SCP-4660-1 has been observed to trigger minor anomalous abilities[[footnote]]Abilities observed have included short-range teleportation, enhanced strength, and achieving velocities exceeding what is possible for a non-anomalous member of SCP-4660-1&#39;s species.[[/footnote]] or causing its own death, to achieve reentry. While within SCP-4660-3, SCP-4660-1 behaves similarly to non-anomalous members of its species.

Attempts to remove SCP-4660-2 from SCP-4660-1 have proven impossible. Removal of SCP-4660-2 will cause SCP-4660-1 to reappear in the living room of SCP-4660-3 with SCP-4660-2 around its neck. Any damage sustained to SCP-4660-2 that severely compromises its integrity or otherwise removes it from around SCP-4660-1&#39;s neck likewise will trigger SCP-4660-1 to vanish and reappear within SCP-4660-3. --Testing to remove SCP-4660-2 from SCP-4660-1 for an extended period of time is currently ongoing.-- Testing to remove SCP-4660-2 from SCP-4660-1 for an extended period of time has been suspended per order of the Ethics Committee.

The number listed on SCP-4660-2&#39;s tag is currently out of service. Local phone records have identified the number as being a former landline for SCP-4660-3. Attempts to contact previous owners of SCP-4660-3 are ongoing. As of the time of writing, none of these former owners, with the exception of SCP-4660-3&#39;s most recent residents, have been located by Foundation agents.  

**Discovery:** SCP-4660 was discovered on September 31st, 2017 following the detection of several spikes in Elan-Vital Energy within the vicinity of SCP-4660-3. An investigation by members of MTF Tau-51 (&#34;Urban Brawl&#34;) lead to the discovery of both the properties of SCP-4660-1 and SCP-4660-2. 

**Addendum: Interview Log 4660-01**

&gt; **Interviewed:** Jayden Coles
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** [[[Portland Vice|Agent Beatrice Ross]]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** The following interview was conducted at SCP-4660-3 on October 1st, 2017, following the discovery of SCP-4660-1 after it demonstrated its ability by getting hit by a car. Agent Ross was selected for the interview due to her expertise as resident thaumatologist of MTF Tau-51. Jayden Coles is the former owner of SCP-4660-3. SCP-4660-1 was present during the interview due to the inability of SCP Foundation personnel to remove it from the site of SCP-4660-3. 
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;Begin Log&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Ross:** Afternoon Mr. Coles. I&#39;m Agent Ross. My colleagues and I will be out of your hair soon enough. I just got a few questions for you about your cat.
&gt; 
&gt; **Coles:** That&#39;s not my cat.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ross:** Pardon?
&gt; 
&gt; **Coles:** Buttercup isn&#39;t my cat. My husband and I are deathly allergic. Apparently, it&#39;s been terrorizing this place for years now. Most of the previous owners were content in just letting it inside. It&#39;s a very friendly cat. But, you know, deathly allergic.
&gt; 
&gt; //Coles shrugs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Coles:** Are you guys going to take it away?
&gt; 
&gt; **Ross:** It&#39;s very likely we will have to, yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Coles:** Good. It&#39;s all yours.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ross:** You&#39;re very quick to get rid of her.
&gt; 
&gt; **Coles:** Can you blame me? It&#39;s constantly trying to get inside my house. We&#39;ll hear it meowing outside for hours and hours, suddenly stop, and then appear in our living room like some kind of Houdini. I&#39;ve watched it throw itself in front of cars, get torn apart by a coyote, and chew holes in the garage door. It creeps me out. Two weeks ago it threw itself through the glass on the second story window. Those were new panes. A cat shouldn&#39;t be able to do that. To be honest with you, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a cat anymore. I mean, just watch this.
&gt; 
&gt; //Coles crosses the room, picks up SCP-4660-1, and throws it at a nearby wall. An audible crack is heard as SCP-4660-1 makes contact, and it immediately vanishes and reappears at the center of SCP-4660-3&#39;s living room.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ross:** Jesus Christ! What the hell is wrong with you?!?
&gt; 
&gt; **Coles:** Look. Good as new. 
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-4660-1 is apparently unharmed. SCP-4660-1 watches Coles briefly, then moves to a corner of the room before lying down. Ross takes several notes and then resumes the interview.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ross:** So what do you think it is?
&gt; 
&gt; **Coles:** I don&#39;t know. I just wish it would stop coming back. Or at least it wasn&#39;t so friendly. That would make all of this easier. I personally watched it die nine times in the last six months... 
&gt; 
&gt; //Coles sighs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Coles:** Listen, if you guys can stop this, it&#39;s all yours. Hell, we&#39;ll sell you the place if you want. My husband and I just want to get away from that thing. 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**

As of 03/10/2017 the property containing SCP-4660-3 has been purchased from its former residents and converted to a satellite site while maintaining the guise of civilian housing. Surveillance of Jayden Coles and his family is ongoing.
