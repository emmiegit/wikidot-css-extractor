So this is probably where I&#39;d add an inspirational quote, but I&#39;m not that smart. Or inspirational for that matter. Any-who: Welcome to HunterDog&#39;s totally original page, this is 100% (of 0%) the first article ever made (it definitely isn&#39;t) and is completely the first like this. I don&#39;t have any main character or whatever, as Dr. Dog just isn&#39;t it, so it&#39;s not like a personnel page or anything.
Anyway, I like food, so I&#39;m probably just gonna stick some pictures of food I like:

Anyway that concludes my presentation about food. Man I am definitely a foodie. I rate it all food/food. (Except for the Zebra, which was pretty fuckin&#39; cute.)

Hey! I made some stuff (surprisingly.)

[[[SCP-5450]]] - Fintastic Soup, figures. It&#39;s food, but when eaten. You become shark-ized. Maybe Sharkinator-9000 would have been a better name. Yeah, probably not. Made it in seven hours for Jam-Con 2020.

[[[SCP-5750]]] - Can&#39;t say no to cookies! Man I crave some thin mints now. Seriously though they are delicious. Made this in six hours for Jam-Con 2020.

[[[critter-profile-potoooooooo|Critter Profile: Potoooooooo]]] - Even if I made him, I still love him. My first article! Made this in a day for Jam-Con 2020.

[[tab About Me]]
So now I gotta make a page about myself? Who&#39;s idea was this. Anyway I&#39;m HunterDog, or Dog. I love articles with a comedic, sad, or wholesome tone. Comedy articles are foremost my favorite, wholesome being next. Sad is the other emotion. I&#39;m not the most emotional person, so good, sad pieces can spark something.

Seriously. Who&#39;s idea was this, it means I gotta write more. Yeesh.
So more things about me:
I love Wilsons Articles. Seriously, I love all the critters.
I don&#39;t really read any other GoI&#39;s other than wilsons.
I love silly ideas over serious ideas. While serious ideas are good for important pieces, I tend to actually prefer sillier articles.
I love food. Send me food articles. (Not Ambrose though.)
I absolutely adore pieces that use character interactions to tell a story. 
I love the occasional long article. If it&#39;s kept me through, I don&#39;t mind the length.

Ambrose, just doesn&#39;t do it for me.
Prometheus Labs, similarly.
Horrible Comedy. Please, I love to laugh/smile.
Thaumiels (It must be an exceptional Thaumiel for me to like it.)

[[tab Characters]]
This is the page for my characters, anyone is free to use them as long as you portray them properly.

Sadly there is no big ones yet, maybe in the future. I originally had someone planned to use in all my things but it just didn&#39;t happen.
