We&#39;re doing a bunch of new things for this month&#39;s Site News! Changes include a revamped Fan-content area, a contest recap, and an editor&#39;s choice section! Feedback on all of these things would be greatly appreciated, so please let us know in the comments what you think about it.

Before we start though, I just want to give a huge thank you to TSATPWTCOTTTADC and Uncle Nicolini, without whom none of this would have been possible. Seriously, they&#39;re amazing.

[[size 75%]]This is a series showing off news from the site, articles from the past month[[footnote]] with a rating above 0 [[/footnote]], and fan-content for you to check out and discover! Be sure to leave a comment with your thoughts![[/size]]

++++* Fandom Stuff
* [[[scp-oct-hub| SCP OCT Hub]]] - In the void left by March Madness, a new unofficial site arena has opened up. Original Characters vs Original Characters, the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny and Posting has begun. Organized by PeppersGhost.
* [[[scp-series-5| SCP Series 5]]] - The 4000 contest has finally concluded (check out the post-game stats page below) and Series 5 is finally open to contributions! Get out there and start making articles!

++++* Event Featured Articles

This month had no theme! Instead, winners from the previous [[[Doomsday Contest]]] got their articles featured! Check them out below!

++++* Featured Articles

* The featured articles for August were [[[SCP-3379]]] (&#34;D-11424 and the Arctic Meat Hole of Infinite Wonders&#34;) by Darkstuff and Weryllium, [[[SCP-3564]]] (&#34;The Immortal Bard, Act Ⅱ: Return of Shakespeare&#34;) by MaliceAforethought, [[[SCP-3934]]] (&#34;For Sale: Loch Ness Monsters&#34;) by Modern_erasmus, and [[[Parts]]] by Fieldstone.
 * In [[[SCP-3379]]], D-11424, inter-dimensional free-man, is put through a series of challenges, possibly for the right to his kidneys. I&#39;m not sure though, don&#39;t speak walrus.
 * In [[[SCP-3564]]], Shakespeare comes back from the dead to do...something. Certainly something.
 * In [[[SCP-3934]]], MC&amp;D play fetch with the Foundation using the Loch Ness Monster.
 * In [[[Parts]]], sacrifice is made apparent in the face of overwhelming good.


++++* Editor&#39;s Choice Articles

* [[[SCP-3009]]] (&#34;Hi, I&#39;m Your Snappelganger!&#34;) by Keyii - Wonderful characterization of lovable characters will have you attached to Stacey Lee quickly.
* [[[SCP-3758]]] (&#34;The Last Dodo&#34;) by daveyoufool - A very predictable article until it very much isn&#39;t.
* [[[SCP-3844]]] (&#34;To Slay a Dragon&#34;) by Captain Kirby - Science cannot truly kill whimsy.
* [[[SCP-4028]]] (&#34;La Historia de Don Quixote de la Mancha&#34;) by The Great Hippo - Huge bias here, but I love Don Quixote and this meta-narrative is truly incredible.
* [[[SCP-4239]]] (&#34;Project Kenowhere Central Volunteer Hub...&#34;) by scarhaver and Dolphinslugchugger - Pretty much a GAW 001 proposal.
* [[[SCP-4113]]] (&#34;Long is the Way You Must Wander&#34;) by Doctor Cimmerian - Rule of cool reigns supreme here. Vikings, space, and lightsabers.
* [[[Inside the Wall]]] by Taylor Itkin - This is truly inspired and I highly suggest it.
* [[[Intermission]]] by tygently - I had no idea what Third Law was prior to this, but the article got me interested in exploring the canon.
* [[[ListPages Magic and You]]] by Croquembouche - The most helpful tool once could imagine for learning Listpages wizardy.

Varaxous
&gt; [[[SCP-4069|SCP-4069: Out of Range]]] by Cyantreuse is a pretty excellent read. Don&#39;t let the beginning fool you, this isn&#39;t a failed self-deletion. There&#39;s a lot going here, much of it deeper than it may seem. 100% worth a second read through, 200% worth reading through the follow up.
&gt;
&gt; [[[SCP-4999|SCP-4999: Someone to Watch Over us]]] by CadaverCommander. All I need to say about this one is that it&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve read something and gotten chills because of it.
&gt;
&gt; [[[SCP-4017|SCP-4017: An Epilogue, Too Late to Matter]]] by 9Volt. There&#39;s a LOT of stuff here and all of it is extremely interesting. Exploring some aspects of Volt&#39;s own Second Hytoth, this piece really takes the &#39;History&#39; theme to the max, exploring a lot of the Foundationverse through out. Warning: reading it may cause you to spend hours reading the other Church of the Second Hytoth articles.

Uncle Nicolini
&gt; [[[scp-4007|SCP-4007: Kagemusha]]] by weizhong is by far my favorite article in the entire contest. It&#39;s expertly written and does everything to make you say &#39;Wait, what?&#39; before the big reveal. I won&#39;t spoil it for you, so I highly encourage you to give it a read.
&gt;
&gt; A few other favorites of mine (in no particular order) are as follows;
&gt; [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4444 SCP-4444: Bush v. Gore] by djkaktus
&gt; [[[scp-4041|SCP-4041: Teach the Controversy]]] by Weryllium
&gt; [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4999 SCP-4999: Someone to Watch Over Us] by CadaverCommander

You will notice little &#39;📈&#39; emojis besides some articles. That denotes SCP articles which were under 30 and tales which were under 20 when this edition of site news was posted. Give them a little love! Speaking from personal experience, the most frustrating thing that can happen to an article is not deletion, but stagnating below 20 without any comments. So try to read, vote, and comment on these articles! They&#39;re often hidden gems :)
