**Item #:** SCP-1987-J

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All printed copies or recordings of SCP-1987-J are to be destroyed, except for a single printed copy to be stored in a locked safe at Site 5150. One six-string electric guitar, of any standard model, is to be made available for testing purposes. As of ██/██/20██, testing is to be conducted by and on D-class personnel only. Any people or objects affected by SCP-1987-J are to be examined immediately after conclusion of test and archived or neutralized as necessary. Female staff members are not to be exposed to SCP-1987-J&#39;s effects under any circumstances.

In the event of a manifestation of SCP-1987-J-1, the D-class responsible for activating SCP-1987-J is to accept its request. No staff are to interact with SCP-1987-J-1 directly. Test subject may be reassigned in event of failure; in event of success, Procedure Counter-XK-25R624 is to be enacted immediately.

Mobile Task Force Omega-2112 (&#34;Beaumont Police Department&#34;) is to monitor major and independent music publishers and online music distribution networks for any indication of an independent rediscovery of SCP-1987-J. In the event of a containment breach, all offending media is to be removed from public consumption and MTF Omega-2112 is authorized to execute Procedure Kasem, Procedure Sumner, or Procedure Cobain at O5 discretion.

**Description:** SCP-1987-J is a sequence of chords intended to be played on an electric guitar, which produces several anomalous effects when played. SCP-1987-J has been discovered independently by several individuals since the development of the electric guitar in the 1930s. The earliest known written copy exists in the form of a hand-written tabulature dated to 1965, with the note &#34;To J.H. - pretty cool, huh? -L.R.&#34; in the margin. 

[[include component:image-block name=tab.jpg|caption=Partial SCP-1987-J tabulature]]


Extensive testing has indicated that any person who is aware of how SCP-1987-J is intended to sound when played, and has access to an electric guitar and amplifier, is able to produce SCP-1987-J, regardless of any previously documented ability to play guitar or lack thereof. Once play begins, anomalous effects begin to occur within the area where SCP-1987-J is audible after approximately 1.6 seconds, and continue to manifest every 10-30 seconds, until play ceases or SCP-1987-J-1 manifests. No specific pattern as to the effects produced by SCP-1987-J-1 has been discerned to date. All effects produced by SCP-1987-J are permanent and are not reversed by cessation of play or subsequent exposure. Effects documented as a result of SCP-1987-J include:

* Perception by onlookers that the player is unusually physically attractive or charismatic.
* Spontaneous lengthening of the player&#39;s hair and/or enlargement of genitals.
* Apparent age of all females within area of effect changing to approximately eighteen years, and/or spontaneous manifestation of eight to ten such individuals if no female subjects are present. (Concurrent transmogrification of subjects&#39; clothes into thong bikinis, lingerie, or leather fetish gear has occurred in 68% of documented instances - extensive testing has been authorized to determine where effects are correlated.)
* Transformation of late-model automobiles in area of effect to vintage hot rods, muscle cars, or custom motorcycles.
* Spontaneous manifestation of large quantities of distilled alcoholic beverages.
* Spontaneous manifestation of sparks, pyrotechnics, or large fans.
* Immunity of the player to bullets.
* Resurrection of the dead, either to their previous state or as &#34;zombies&#34; loyal to the player.
* Spontaneous manifestations of &#34;dragons&#34;, dinosaurs, or scantily-clad female &#34;angels&#34; loyal to the player.
* Liquefaction of observers&#39; facial features.
* Spontaneous pregnancy in fertile female subjects.
* Spontaneous pregnancy in infertile female subjects.
* Spontaneous pregnancy in male subjects.

Testing has determined that all above effects are only produced when SCP-1987-J is performed on an electric guitar. Attempts to produce SCP-1987-J on acoustic guitar, keyboard, banjo, ukulele, or saxophone have produced a memetic field which causes all observers to view the player as &#34;uncool&#34; or &#34;a sellout&#34;, with extended test sessions resulting in permanent [REDACTED] testicles.

SCP-1987-J-1 is an entity resembling a Caucasian male of approximately 25 years age, which to date has manifested on any occasion when performance of SCP-1987-J has passed a collective total of three minutes, one second in duration. SCP-1987-J-1, which has variously introduced itself by the names &#34;Count Rockula&#34;, &#34;Sir Rocksalot&#34;, and &#34;the Lord of the Strings&#34;, will immediately upon manifesting order the player to cease and challenge him or her to what it describes as an &#34;Epic Rockdown of Rocktimate Rockstiny&#34;, which has been observed to take the form of a &#34;guitar duel&#34; between SCP-1987-J-1 and the player, with the offer of &#34;Ultimate Rockness&#34; if the player is successful.

The nature of &#34;Ultimate Rockness&#34; has yet to be determined - in all observed instances, SCP-1987-J-1 has declared itself the winner and demanifested, followed by the player&#39;s spontaneous transformation into an instance of SCP-1987-J-2 - an unattractive male (regardless of the player&#39;s original gender) approximately 45 years of age, wearing the uniform of a gas station attendant, which identifies itself as &#34;Earl&#34;, and claims to be a fan of country music. All instances of SCP-1987-J-2 have proven unable to produce SCP-1987-J or to display any degree of skill with the guitar, and have been assigned to the maintenance of the Foundation&#39;s motor pool.

//Memo from Dr. Klein: As of ██/██/20██, I am hereby forbidding all staff other than D-class from conducting tests on SCP-1987-J. To date, thirty-eight researchers at Site 5150 alone have become iterations of SCP-1987-J-2 while attempting to acquire the power of Ultimate Rockness. Site 1137 is now facing a five-month backlog on critical laboratory work; however, we possess well in excess of the required automobile maintenance staff, and will have to resort to assigning the SCP-1987-J-2 instances as D-class due to a lack of work to assign them. As tempting as Ultimate Rockness may be, we have more important concerns at this time.//</textarea></pre>
