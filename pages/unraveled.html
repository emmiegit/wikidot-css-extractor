//&#34;Think of reality as a tapestry. Each individual strand within that tapestry represents a concept within this reality construct. As in any fabric, these concepts are interwoven to provide a stable basis. Pick at one long enough and it will snag, creating highly localized damage to the structural integrity of reality. Keep picking at it, and everything unravels.&#34;//

&gt; On 21 September 1999, hikers in the hills surrounding Hrastovica, Croatia discovered human remains in a cave system. The remains showed extensive trauma to the skull and brain. The following log was recovered from a miniaturized Solid State Drive (SSD) embedded in a recording device implanted directly into the temporal lobe.

&gt; {{Watching that scroll across my retinal display is distracting and at the same time mind-numbingly boring. This thing takes so long to start up, it feels like I&#39;m getting old while it boots.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Anyway, first things first. My name is...you know what? I&#39;m not even sure who I&#39;m recording this for. I&#39;m me, I think. Anyway, so, first deployment...yeah. I don&#39;t know how long to go in this rust bucket, so I&#39;ll...wait. Grabenwald is looking at me funny.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{I stared him down, don&#39;t know what his problem is anyway. Like I said, once again first mission time and I want to record this for my kids. Heh, kids. Wish I could do video as well, but they didn&#39;t install that shit this time round, so this&#39;ll have to do. What I was trying to say before Grabenwald went all bug-eyed on me just now is that I&#39;m in a big old Mi-24P Hind-F heading to my first deployment, off to fight the big bad unraveling, again.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{I remember the eighties, at least, I think I do. Maybe not me, but it&#39;s definitely in my head somewhere. I think I remember people back then whining about the Russians nuking us to hell and back; funny thing how we were the ones that managed to pick so hard at the scab holding this piece of shit reality together that we ended up breaking it completely, hah. I&#39;m guessing we&#39;d take a good old-fashioned nuking over what happened any day.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Anyway, we&#39;re en-route to some shit-hole called Hrastovica, supposed to be in Croatia or something. Reports about general faulting and distortions with possible extra-reality incursions, the usual. What it comes down to is bugs, things I can&#39;t look at for too long and things that have tentacles in all the wrong places. Doesn&#39;t matter, the stuff we have with us will take care of any nasties we...GODDAMN CABRERA, STOP FUCKING SINGING...anyway, NO, YOU DICK. Anyway, I just realized I probably sound jaded. Suppose I am, really. I don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;ve done a first run, none of us do. All I know is that I would give anything to be able to turn back the clock and kick our asses, just stomp into that boardroom underneath Site-Alpha and kick their collective asses to make sure whoever came up with Project Arclight ends up pushing daisies, even if it&#39;s me. We never should have messed with those strands out in the Davis Strait. Let sleeping shit lie, people, that&#39;s your motto for today. And yesterday. And tomorrow, but definitely yesterday. If we had, maybe we&#39;d still have more than one inhabitable continent. Gotta go for a moment, be right back.}}

&gt; {{Told you it wouldn&#39;t take long. Had to slap some sense into Cabrera. If he opens up with &#34;She&#39;ll be coming round the mountain when she comes&#34;, I swear I&#39;ll break his face. Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, no more &#39;murica. Right. Well, I got this song in my head called &#34;Yellow Submarine&#34;, don&#39;t know who it&#39;s by, but they sing something like &#34;We all live in a yellow submarine&#34; or something, and it&#39;s pretty much like that, only instead of a submarine, it&#39;s Europe and it&#39;s not yellow, it&#39;s grey. Almost two billion people squashed together, behind walls that probably won&#39;t protect us when everything finally collapses into insanity.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Wait a minute, MTFC is saying something. Oh, she&#39;s telling Cabrera to shut up. Good. Tough old fucker she is, twenty-four and a total veteran. I&#39;m sixteen and if I&#39;m lucky in eight years time, I&#39;ll be alive. Well, I&#39;ll be alive anyway, but maybe I won&#39;t. It&#39;s confusing. Anyway, heard she&#39;s taken so many hits there&#39;s nothing in her body that was there when she was hatched.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{We&#39;re about to touch down, so I&#39;m going to have to actually pay some attention to what&#39;s going on. Won&#39;t pause, not worth it.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Back. Had to adjust the noise reduction filter level though. God, this place really is a shit-hole. Houses cobbled together from Aircrete blocks and some kind of metal sheeting, goats wandering in the street, no asphalt, just dirt roads. Seriously, the fuck did they sent us now? Shit, have to go again, control estimates contact in six and Donovan is assing about. He&#39;s going to...}}

&gt; {{That&#39;s better. One of my lenses got knocked off-center, I think. Probably damaged the nano-cables connecting them to the implant&#39;s core, or some other scientific-sounding bullshit like that. Seems to be okay now. Anyway, big old spatial anomaly to the face when we disembarked, pushing through unknown number of hostiles, nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before, but that&#39;s not saying a lot. Big fuckers too, hard to focus on, look like...uhh...tapeworms crossed with little tornados? Doesn&#39;t make sense, I know, but that&#39;s the best I can do. Took out six of us and one gave me a nice little slap before we managed to neutralize them with Christophson&#39;s banishment gear. Sometimes I&#39;m glad we&#39;re working with the GOC these days. I&#39;d be happier if they&#39;d stop using those god-awful code names. Christophson wants us to call him Snake. Seriously.}}

//July 23rd 1999, reality iteration X34-BH-SS1C//

In a covert facility hidden beneath the streets of The Hague, Foundation lab technicians were preparing O5-6#5122 for birth.

&#34;Again?&#34; a mousy-haired tech with an ungainly hunch asked.

&#34;Again. Can&#39;t seem to keep themselves alive, but then, that&#39;s some awful stuff they have to go up against,&#34; his colleague answered.

&#34;I know, but you wonder why we don&#39;t give up. Most of the earth&#39;s population squashed into one continent, reality breaking up around us...why even bother anymore, you know?&#34;

&#34;Good question, Vin. If I wasn&#39;t busy doing my job I&#39;d answer that that&#39;s probably just the human race for you. It doesn&#39;t give up, even when hope is a meaningless word.&#34;

Senior technical assistant Vincenzo DiGatta squinted at the vat. &#34;What I really want to know is why they insist on cloning themselves instead of sending out soldiers.&#34;

&#34;Well if you want to know, Meyers over in Strategic Command has a theory. Something about them being the ones who caused it, and them wanting to be the ones to solve it. Doesn&#39;t help that these days the peasant to professional ratio is something like a million to one.&#34;

&#34;So why bother?&#34; Vincenzo said again.

&#34;I don&#39;t know, Vin. I just don&#39;t, okay? Let&#39;s just get this done so the boys in Cyber can add the mods.&#34;

They silently watched the monitors as the cloned fetus entered a phase of rapidly accelerated growth.</textarea></pre>
