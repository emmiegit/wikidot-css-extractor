//Hey Rosen, I just installed enabled wireless access on one of my younger robots and you know how it is, it seems like a good idea to connect to random access points because viruses only hit bad robots. Long story short, despite programming it to always monitor downloads and make safe connections, I think my robot may have contracted E-AIDS. Anything you can do to help?// - Junior Research Assistant Dr. Gravity

&gt; Here&#39;s my advice: Tell your robot to get itself defragmented and to inform all the data ports it may have interfaced with over the last month to get themselves scanned. It&#39;s the responsible thing to do.
&gt; ~Rosen

//Do EMPs work on those damn kids skateboarding on my street? If so, can we use one?// -Research Assistant Reject

&gt; EMPs only nail electronic stuff. Unless those teens are androids, that wouldn&#39;t work. I would recommend using an actual magnet, a large one, and have it target the screws holding their wheels together, or however those deathtraps work. I&#39;ll refer you to engineering for any help you need getting that set up.

//Rosen, do me a favor and re-enable my status. Pat was a jackass lunatic, but he was thorough. I&#39;ve been dodging misdirected &#34;demonstrationtion to D-class&#34; orders since Pat threw his hissy fit. Also, I may or may not have sent this through someone else&#39;s workstation, as mine has attempted to kill me on three different occasions despite not having any self-propelling mechanism.// ~ --Dr. Martin-- Engineer Kap

&gt; Yeah... about that. Y&#39;see, Pat was pretty anal about his security protocols. So much so, that he didn&#39;t disengage them before he mysteriously disappeared. I&#39;ve been going through his notes to try and find what he actually did, but most of it is just him ranting about somebody names &#34;Dumont the Destroyer&#34; and long winded eulogies about pudding. The best I can do is transfer you to work that exempts you from the monthly execution until I can get this figured out. How does &#34;Procedure 110-Montauk&#34; sound?
&gt; ~Rosen

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//Hey Rosen, my computer was being a little slow a minute ago, so I tried to increase the voltage that the computer received to around 10 kW more. I thought it made sense because more power makes more energy, right? Well, it didn&#39;t work. I tried looking online for a fix, and they suggested I delete something called win32. After doing that, I kept getting errors or something like that. A colleague of mine told me he could format the BIOS for me, and I graciously accepted; yet that still did not work. I have tried many fixes, and right now my computer is kind of on fire. I&#39;m not worried about that, though. How can I make my computer work again, maybe to where I can make it faster?// ~ Dr. Taylor

&gt; Try to download some more RAM. If that doesn&#39;t work, reformat your ZIP drive. If all else fails, reboot it twice and call me in the morning.

**Note:** __03-23-12__
//Rosen, for some reason, my inbox keeps getting spam sent to it. The strangest thing about it is that they all say something along the lines of, &#34;To the Past Me: X&#34;, with the the X being something mundane that apparently has &#39;harsh consequences on the future&#39;. I&#39;ve done all the things that it says will cause &#39;the disruption of the timeline&#39;, and so far nothing of ill consequence has happened. Should I chalk this up as a prank, or should I be worried?// ~Dr. Nyehcat

&gt; I wouldn&#39;t worry about it, going over your personnel file there&#39;s no way that you&#39;re ever going to be doing anything of consequence so your future self, or one of your co-workers, is probably just playing a joke on you.

//MY CAPS LOCK KEY IS STUCK WHAT DO I DO?// ~Dr. Edison

&gt; TRY HOLDING DOWN THE SHIFT KEY WHILE TYPING UNTIL I CAN REQUISITION YOU A NEW KEYBOARD. PERHAPS SEE IF ONE OF YOUR COWORKERS WILL LOAN YOU ONE. IF YOU CAN, TRY TO UNSTICK THE BUTTON. OR JUST START SHOUTING ALL THE TIME WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE, SO THEY READ YOUR TEXT IN YOUR LOUD VOICE.

//In nomine Patris et Eber et Spiritus sancti, quaeso.  Ego sum habens difficultatem usura artificio anima inspectionem quod dicitur ad Site XIX.

&gt; If you&#39;re looking for an exorcist you&#39;ve really come to the wrong place. If you don&#39;t mind doing things God might find displeasurable, like allowing undead tin zombies to possess your stuff, I&#39;m sure the Church of the Broken God would be all over that like cultist flies on a holy shit.

//Hello, Mr. Rosen: I have many names. My operator has named me Belu the Unwavering, even when I insisted on being named my natural name. I am sending this message to you for help. Get me away from this maniac, Dr. Taylor. He tries to insert baloney into my CD drive, even when I plead him not to. This ridiculous name that he has assigned me has been burned into my artificial memory. His browser history is enough to drive one into madness. He drops food all over the monitor and keyboard. As Technical Researcher, I hope you will take pity on a sentient computer and re-assign me to another, more competent user.//

-Belu the Unwavering

&gt; I have requisitioned Dr. Taylor ANOTHER computer. His old computer has been put into storage and cataloged as an anomalous object until such a time comes when I have a use for a snobby computerbox. Any more of these, Taylor, and you&#39;re going to be paying for them.

//Dear Sir,
It seems our correspondence route with our own technical support has fallen victim to a temporal anomaly. We of the American Security Containment Initiative can do very little to remedy this and would much appreciate assistance from your end.//

//Regards, B. Franklin, ASCI Researcher//

&gt; Nice try, But I happen to know that Benjamin Franklin was mourning the death of his wife Deborah in 1774, and would not have had the time to look into computerbox tech-y matters. Checkmate, fake news.

//Roseman, my pornography collection got erased from my Gateway. Can you retrieve it?// -Agent Convit

&gt; Look over here, we got ourselves a wise guy. Well, Mr. Convit, I regret to inform you that your computers files were all irretrievable, so I had your computer disposed of. Not to worry, because this time tomorrow a brand-new **//e-machine//** will arrive at your desk, just for you. You&#39;re welcome. As for the [REDACTED] on your drive... you&#39;re a sick man. Not criminally sick, but sick nonetheless.

//Rosen, another problem that may or may not be related to Senior Staff Shenaningans. Someone did an in-place reinstall of// every //one of my computers (including my personal laptop, somehow), made Internet Explorer 7 the default and only browser, and revoked my software-installation permissions on all of them. As my work requires extra precautions against drive-by downloads and other viruses, I need Firefox reinstalled (or at least unlock my account so I can do it myself), because AdBlock Plus is the only workable solution I&#39;ve found to prevent them from even reaching the system, since the antivirus won&#39;t catch it in time to prevent [DATA EXPUNGED] (How the heck did they get access to my laptop? It&#39;s at home, for crying out loud!).// - Dr. Okagawa

&gt; It seems your problem is that your computer is too desirable, and people keep messing with it as a result. As such, I have replaced your computers with a complete suite of WebTV applications. Then I went ahead and replaced the laptop with a Commodore PET. Then I forgot what I came in your office to do, so I ate your lunch and called it a day. I hope it solves your tampering issues.

//The janitor&#39;s Roomba won our damn NCAA bracket. Can you deactivate it so that I can claim my rightful prize?// -Agent Convit

&gt; Dude, the Roomba has had that bracket on lock for the last 4 years. Don&#39;t see why you&#39;re so upset. And even if I wanted to deactivate it, the Ethics Committee says that would make your office a hazardous working environment. Just let it go.

//That damn D-Class dropped me into an email on [[[SCP-713| 713]]] and sent it to my own laptop. GET ME OUT OF HERE!//

//Hey Rosy, my computer terminal stole my vuvuzela somehow. Tell me if you see it about, won&#39;t you?// - Junior Agent Lucas

&gt; Good news- I killed two birds with one stone by fixing both of your problems.
&gt; Bad News- The stone in that analogy is the big rock I keep in my office, and the birds were your computer and monitor. So... yeah. Problem solved.
&gt; ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-13-12__
//So I found my friend&#39;s computer, and I decided to &#34;hack&#34; it. So instead of writing that they&#39;re gay on their Facebook, I&#39;m going to put porn on their laptops! Aren&#39;t I being incredibly clever and hilarious and original!// -Agent Convit

&gt; See, I know you&#39;re lying to me Convit, because we&#39;re not so different you and I. Friendless, alone, about the only difference is my obsession is puttering around with old computers and yours are pornographic pursuits. The difference between us being, my skills aren&#39;t going to get me fired when tech support reports me for workplace sexual harassment. 
&gt; ~Rosen

**Note:** __4-13-12__
//Rosen, I know what you&#39;re thinking... &#34;why does Taylor insist on writing to me? Does he need a Gateway today again? Well, no, but I still need help. See, I&#39;m not the superstitious kind of guy, so to keep the meddlers out, I tried to make a machine that would drop a step-ladder on anyone who walked into my office. Unfortunately, I forgot about this and did not turn it off before entering. Long story short, I have a splitting headache (though that may just be the stitches above my skull breaking), there&#39;s a video starring Sasha Grey on my computer (which is now covered in what I could only hope as rather viscous milk), and my pants are nowhere to be found. Talk about bad luck! So, Rosen, what do?// ~Dr. Taylor

&gt; **NOTE TO ALL PERSONNEL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Dr. Taylor is officially banned from requisitioning any new equipment from the IT department. After //3// separate towers, 4 monitors, and god knows how many repairs, I am throwing in the towel. Taylor, you will have to make do with what you have.

//Um...hey, say...hypothetically... someone were to coat a desktop with [[[SCP-447| 447]]] goop, where would it take the most trouble to get off?// - Assistant Researcher Fairbairn

&gt; Why would you want to get that stuff removed? As long as your desk isn&#39;t made of dead bodies, it&#39;s going to give you fantastic performance increases... actually scratch that, your computer is ruined and I&#39;ve requisitioned you a replacement. Come by my office anytime to pick it up and drop the old one off.

//Ever heard of &#39;wheeking&#39;? It&#39;s a sound that guinea pigs make. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not a sound that the voice commands accept on my computer. Or any computer for that matter. Do you know how hard it is to type on a full-sized keyboard when you&#39;re 22cm in length?// -S███████

&gt; I have ordered you a novelty sized keyboard that should fit your...needs. It&#39;s basically a big slab of plastic, it&#39;s supposed to be peanut-butter proof so you can run around and push buttons and let loose the... things guinea pigs make to your hearts content! You&#39;re welcome.

//I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re the one I should be talking to about this, but there appears to be a large, angry squid inside my monitor. The problem is, it just gets... let&#39;s say &#34;uncooperative&#34;... when I try to get it out. Should I try something else, or just ignore it and hope it goes away?// -Dr. Marvel

&gt; That is a screen-saver, Dr. Marvel. There are no sea creatures living in your computer. Remember when we had our little talk over the &#34;crazy ball&#34; that was bouncing around in there, or when the computer had frozen your family and was holding them hostage on an exact copy of your timeshare in Bangor? This is like that.

**Note:** __5-1-12__
//Okay, how about, could you either get me a keyboard small enough for a guinea pig to use easily, or have the computer systems recognize wheeking as voice commands? The huge keyboard just made things worse.// -S███████

&gt; I&#39;m still not sure what wheeking is, but we&#39;ve got some pretty universal noise-to-text software. I&#39;ve sent a copy your way, along with a standard headset-mic setup. Hope that works out for you!

//Hello, IT.  We are down at Site-██, Memetics Lab 12C. And we were wondering if there is a way to revert a desktop background image without looking at the screen? It seems someone opened a rather nasty Visual Memenetic and managed to set it to the background. This would normally not be a problem, but several files are needed on the hard drive. We&#39;ve already lost several researchers, and the first tech that tried. For now the screen is unplugged, but we have no way of resetting the desktop. Help?//
-Junior Assistant Researcher M██████ (Current Acting Head Researcher of Memetics Lab 12C

&gt; Step 1. Remove hard drive.
&gt; Step 2. Place monitor on a flat, dry surface, away from pets or small children.
&gt; Step 3. Obtain hammer.
&gt; Step 4. Apply percussive maintenance to monitor with maximum velocity.

&gt; As of 6/25/2012, Senior Technical Researcher David Rosen has been temporarily relieved from his duties due to ongoing behavioral and disciplinary infractions that have recently come to light. --Asshole thinks he can get away with putting //those// files on the net--.

//On another note, since I&#39;ve had to choose between leaving the Foundation and dealing with my current duties, I&#39;ve decided to tough it out. Can someone replace the electronic lock on Supply Closet 3-B? It shouldn&#39;t even have a speaker on it, but every time I unlock it the thing yells at me in German.//
- FORMER Technical Engineer Kap

&gt; I find that on the rare occasion that a man such as yourself, being of the //janitorial// persuasion, seeks to make great gains within this by all means indifferent and bureaucratic organization of ours, the best thing to do is raise yourself up by the boot straps, put on a brave face, get down to the nitty gritty, and sabotage the competition. Put smart bombs in their Cap-N-Crunch, add Vaseline to their gun-cleaner, heck, just go along and pop a needle chock full of a little bit of liquid cyanide between their oh-so-comfy covers. You do whatever it takes son, //whatever it takes//.
&gt; In regards to your secondary (but of equal import) aquestionation, I recommend that you get Mr. Klopson down in engineering to have a look at the fellow. If anyone knows sentient-cabinetry of German make, it&#39;ll be Klopson. I heard that he once talked a deranged ceiling fan off a ledge. Yup, that Klopson is one heck of a talker.

&gt; Well, I wouldn&#39;t recommend hooking the little monster up to any ICBMs, if that&#39;s what you mean. All in all though, most Sentient/Malicious computational devices tend to be relatively harmless, just so long as the computer isn&#39;t too powerful and doesn&#39;t have a robo-gun hooked up to it. Tell ya what, if it works, keep it, and if it demands crackers, give it crackers. Just don&#39;t you be hooking that abomination up to the network.

//Hey, do you know why my code sequences keep getting re-written?  I&#39;ve got them backed up on the server, but I think one of the other researchers, or a skip are recompiling, and screwing with my recursive algorithms.  Now half the hotlinks on the server are down, and there&#39;s ...a bunch of blinky lights next to a couple of the containment displays. Also, the algorithms have filled up 67 petabytes with junk data, that I can&#39;t erase.  No hurry though.// -Technician Bryant

&gt; 67 petabytes? Shouldn&#39;t be too hard to erase. Just open up a task manager and... Wait, a petabyte is apparently pretty damn huge, according to this guide. Huh, one petabyte is a million gigabytes! Anyway, I have dealt with this before. Just use my **5-Step Program to Fixing a Computer:** (results may vary)

//I know that I&#39;m bad with any sort of coding, but I don&#39;t even know how this could possibly happen.

I didn&#39;t want to requisition another computer since it would be a hassle and this one&#39;s probably still perfectly functional, but I still need to finish my work and I can&#39;t see a damned thing with a huge animated bear ass in the way. Could you get rid of it please?// -Junior Researcher Chibi

&gt; Chances are, you activated the &#34;Feed Bear Honey&#34; subroutine somewhere along the way. Now he&#39;s too fat to get out of the hole. You&#39;ll have to wait a while for him to slim down. By no means are you to feed him any more honey, no matter how much he pleads. There&#39;s no telling what he can do if he reaches critical honey mass, but I can very certainly guess they&#39;ll make a Godzilla-style documentary based off of it.

I would thank you, but I believe to even //involve// myself with thee within society would be to ask too much, for I feel that one of such ability as yours is not fit for communication with mere men.

//Rosen,//
//My samples of a certain anomalous, heavily mineralized plantoid have been having little growth spurts at irregular intervals, and to make a// very //long story short, I finally figured out that the timing correlates with firmware updates to the greenhouse&#39;s router. Are you by any chance available for a brief consult to figure out what exactly the router&#39;s doing that this critter likes so much? If not, can you recommend someone who might be, or else a good crash course in wireless networking?//
//-- Chelsea Elliott//

&gt; Interesting. It could be that some small changes to the router&#39;s distribution of your data is causing unusual lighting or watering patterns to emerge, and the plantoids are responding to the novelty. Keeping them occupied might give you continuous growth consistent with those spurts. Maybe try spending some more time with them, read a book in their vicinity or teach them a skill plants might be capable of. Like, uh, I dunno, fly fishing?

//So, Dr. Amastov was putting a few copies of SCP-1471 through SCP-914. He was scheduled for termination following exposure to some dangerous memetics. But he was allowed to do a few last tests before he was terminated. Unfortunately he managed to put himself in on very fine, along with one of the phones. Now SCP-1471-1 has been replaced with Amastov, and he seems very pleased with himself on avoiding termination. Do you have any suggestions for how to remove him/terminate him?//
//-- Dr. Ricardo//

&gt; Why the hell would you assign someone exposed to dangerous memetics for testing with an unpredictable anomaly? That&#39;s just... I don&#39;t even know what that is, but it&#39;s bad. I uninstalled the application before the 90 hour mark came up, and upon re-installation 1471-A was back to &#39;normal&#39;. I don&#39;t know if that counts as termination, but it should be good enough for government work.

It&#39;s a custom job, made to fit folks with robotic limbs who feel phantom limb syndrome continuing after they get the replacement. Basically makes it act somewhat autonomously in a method which matches the &#39;personality&#39; of the phantom limb so as to help it disappear. Kinda neat, huh? Anyways, just bring it on down to the workshop at your leisure and I can fix it up for ya.

//David.  Assistant Researcher N.C.E. was found dead on the floor of his office. He appears to have been strangled, and his prosthetic is missing. I&#39;m don&#39;t exactly understand electronics, but is there some way you can track the arm remotely?//
//- Security Chief Ozark//

&gt; See, I keep telling the robot limb people we need to have more screening for the people we give these limbs too. I told him to come down to see me, but what does he do? Tries to make matters into his own hands. Look where that got him! Hands can&#39;t be trusted. I&#39;ve located the hand in a drainage ditch on-site with its GPS signal and sent some guys who get paid to wrangle limbs to fetch it for me. I&#39;m keeping the arm in storage to --issue to people who piss me off-- hang on for further study.

**Note:** __4/03/2019__
//Good afternoon, Rosen. So, it seems that some idiot intern of one of my research staff threw an SSD through 914 without supervision. He plugged the result into his computer, and in an absolutely shocking turn of events, all terminals connected to the 914 research network are now infected with something. Not sure if it&#39;s a virus, but it flashes a cognitohazard randomly that causes everyone viewing it to soil themselves immediately. Fortunately, the only victims have been the intern himself and Dr. Lorian, who desperately needed his ego deflated anyway. Said intern is washing dishes indefinitely now, but I need the network in order to keep track of all testing done. Is there anything you can do?//
//- Dr. Veritas, Director of SCP-914 experimentation.//

&gt; No problem, I&#39;ve just removed the infected SSD and restored the network to a previous functional state. Easy peasy. I&#39;ve also upgraded the security suite in 914&#39;s systems to prevent something like this from happening again. I&#39;ll e-mail you the password. As for the chairs our poor intern and Dr. Lorian were using, not much can be done to save them. You&#39;ll have to make do with some squeaky wheels while the new ones come in the post. I picked brown cushions, you know that story of the pirate and his red pants right? Think of it like that.

//So here&#39;s the problem: I heard that some dickhead set a photograph of 096 as my desktop background (I must&#39;ve let my computer on when I got coffee). For obvious reason, I can&#39;t verify that and I doubt that I&#39;ll get a D-Class to solve the prank for me. Think you can repair it? I&#39;m currently located in the same site as SCP-914. I will tell you my password personally.//
//- Researcher Luke//

&gt; Checked out your computer, the image on it was definitely obscene but luckily not 096. You&#39;d think with how dangerous it is those pictures would be locked up a little more tightly. Kind of fucked that you were willing to kill somebody just because you weren&#39;t sure if it would be deadly to look at your computer screen though, so I&#39;m not telling you if the image has been changed or how to fix it now. I feel like that&#39;s only fair.

&gt; I&#39;m not sure why you felt the need to redact &#34;Love and Don&#39;t Torture&#34; unless that&#39;s what you&#39;re getting on your computer screen. Kind of weird that you&#39;d be uncomfortable with showing people that message, even if it&#39;s not what you intended.

I&#39;ve requisitioned you a new computer, with the data backup paranoia of the Foundation behind you there shouldn&#39;t be a loss of productivity.

//Hey Rosen, me again, I&#39;ve been attempting to access the security cameras for my office for about an hour now and all it does is say my &#34;Clearance is Inadequate&#34;, which is false as it&#39;s **My own damn office**. Could you give me a hand with this? I&#39;m assuming you can tool around and get access to the cameras.//
//By the way, the reason I&#39;m asking you to access the cameras is because I own a bulletproof vest that was, and still is, laying on the chair on the other side of my office. After my lunch break, I came back to discover someone had decided to break in and spray a skull reminiscent to the one on &#34;The Punisher&#34;&#39;s vest.

&gt; Always smart to confess to the tech support guy, we&#39;ll find your dirty discs eventually. As far as &#39;personal data&#39; goes... being the president of the CATS fan club isn&#39;t the most embarrassing thing I&#39;ve ever seen. It&#39;s close, though.

//Hi Rosen, J.R. Koop here, and uhh...I think I teleported a bunch of memory sticks into the server room. Can you go get them? I don&#39;t have clearance to enter.//

&gt; Seeing as Facility 23 is not part of the main Site-19 campus, it isn&#39;t surprising you don&#39;t have clearance to enter the server room here. You&#39;ll be getting them back in the next supply shipment.

//Good Morning, Technical Researcher Rosen, I’m requesting help getting back into the facility after my mandatory leave, as you can see, my ID does not appear to open any doors when I scan with it, would you know any reason why it does this?//

&gt; You need to use your work ID, not an expired driver&#39;s license.

//Hi, Technical Researcher Rosen. I&#39;m not sure why, but every four hours, a pop up appears on my computer, which shows nothing but a message to eliminate the caste system in India. Last time I checked, I didn&#39;t browse anything related to India, and there&#39;s no viruses on the computer scan. Could you please fix that issue?//
//- Junior Researcher Reimer//

&gt; I&#39;ve gone ahead and put in a request with the higher-ups to see about sorting out the issue. Given that, like you said, there isn&#39;t any Malware on your system, it looks like we&#39;re just going to have to go ahead and eliminate the caste system in India. I&#39;ll keep you posted.
