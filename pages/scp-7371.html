**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7371 is to be contained within a 325 square foot lead lined concrete chamber located in the ██████ of Site-██. This chamber is to be styled after standard Foundation living spaces. SCP-7371 is not to exit this chamber from shift end to shift start, or for longer than █ hours. All electronic devices capable of controlling site systems are to be confiscated before approaching SCP-7371, or before entering their chamber while they are inside. Requests to enter the chamber must be approved by personnel of clearance level four (4) or higher, and the lead lined dead-bolted door must  be sealed upon its closure. In the event of a breach or incident, the interior deadbolt is to be disconnected to prevent SCP-7371 from leaving the chamber.

**Special Containment Procedures (prior to Incident SCP-7371-1):** SCP-7371 is to be contained within a 325 square foot standard Foundation living space located in the ██████ of Site-██. SCP-7371 is allowed to roam freely at any time.

**Description:** SCP-7371 takes the form of a standard male humanoid, approximately twenty two (22) years of age, that goes by the name of “Dr. John Doe”. SCP-7371 is generally very calm and collected, unless in high stress circumstances.

SCP-7371 demonstrates the ability to swap personalities. It cannot swap personalities at will, instead doing so seemingly at random. No correlation between the personality swaps and any anomalous and or ordinary occurrences have been concluded (Richard this isn&#39;t accurate anymore, see Addendum SCP-7371-3).
SCP-7371 has also demonstrated the passive ability to create small pulses of electromagnetic interference. Despite the fact these pulses can affect Foundation equipment, the strength of interference emitted during the pulses has very low readings and barely affect anything, therefore no extreme caution is to be advised (As per Incident SCP-7371-1, this is now out of date -Richard).

Albeit limited, one of SCP-7371’s personalities shows some level of medical knowledge. SCP-7371 may prove useful as medical personnel due to the low amount of medical personnel at Site-██.

**Discovery:** SCP-7371 was discovered off the coast of one of Hawaii’s many islands, specifically Maui. SCP-7371 was discovered by field agent ██████ while he was on a vacation trip. Agent ██████ had noticed a pattern of occasional electrical interruption. This interruption somehow managed to extend to Foundation issued devices. Upon investigation, the source was traced to SCP-7371, collapsed on the floor of an abandoned concrete building. SCP-7371 was then intercepted and captured under fears of intercepting and or severing Foundation communications.

------

The following is approximated based on security camera footage and personnel accounts:

On the ██ of June ████, SCP-7371 was walking past the containment chamber of SCP-████, when they caught a glimpse of the SCP&#39;s appearance. This startled SCP-7371, sending him into an anxious state. This prompted an electromagnetic pulse, the strength being dramatically larger, possibly due to their anxious state. This electromagnetic pulse caused the containment door to fail, leading to a containment breach.

Post incident (as well as after some smaller incidents involving SCP-7371&#39;s own cell), SCP-7371&#39;s object class has been changed from Safe to Euclid, it’s risk class has been bumped, and safety measures of it&#39;s containment chamber have been increased. SCP-7371 is still permitted to roam Site-██, however they are to stay away from containment cells and to not leave their own cell in-between ████ and ████ hours. SCP-7371 also no longer changes personalities, further interviews have been scheduled.

The following is one of the interviews conducted between Dr. Johnson, Dr. Joyface, and SCP-7371:

&gt; **[BEGIN LOG]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Johnson:** Hello SCP-7371. My name is-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7371:** Johnson, your name is Richard Johnson. I read your name-tag.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Johnson:** Ah I see.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Johnson:** So, now that your personality has stabilized. Can you tell me a bit about yourself?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7371:** Do I have to?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Johnson:** Yes SCP-7371, you have to.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7371:** Fine. But only if you call me by my name for this and future interviews.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Johnson:** And that is?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7371:** John, Dr. John Doe.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Johnson:** Perfect. So can you tell me some of what you remember regarding this “accident”, Mr. John Doe?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7371:** Well, I worked for this small research company. I was in a high level scientific position. We were working on a project, then I saw this weird green light, and next thing I know I&#39;m being carried away by your security agents.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Johnson:** Interesting, and does this research company have a name?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7371:** I don&#39;t know I- I can&#39;t remember.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Johnson:** I see.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Johnson:** What about the electromagnetic pulses? Do you have any idea why you emit them?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7371:** What?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Johnson:** You occasionally emit electromagnetic pulses, or an EMP for short. Do you have any idea why this happens?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7371:** God, I don’t know. Maybe it has something to do with the green flash? That’s my best guess.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Johnson:** I see, I see.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7371:** Can we stop now please? This is starting to stress me out.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Johnson:** Already? You’ve only really answered like two questions. Are you sure you can’t keep going?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7371:** Yes, I am. Now please, can we stop?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Johnson:** Ugh, fine. Just remember though, that since you’re having us end this interview so early, there will be more. Is that ok?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7371:** Yeah thats fine I guess.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Johnson:** Perfect, I’ll talk with you again later then.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Joyface:** Hey Richard.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Johnson:** Yes William?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Joyface:** You said he’s got medical skills, right?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Johnson:** Yes?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Joyface:** I wanna have a meeting with him. His medical skills, even if they aren’t very good, would still be useful.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Johnson:** I see. I can schedule another interview, but I’m not sure if you’ll be able to convince the foundation to allow him to work in the medical ward.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Johnson:** Do you even know the amount of work I went through to convince the foundation that SCP-7371 could be useful? That he could roam freely?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Joyface:** Eh, I’ll find a way. But yes, please schedule another interview.
&gt; 
&gt; **[END LOG]**

&gt; **Notes regarding interview:**
&gt; This is the exact same as the other personalities! Each one of them recalls a different life before this company, but all have the memory of working at this same company, seeing a green light, then ending up here. There has to be more to this. I&#39;m gonna try to get more tests authorized. -Johnson

After further tests (requested by Dr. Richard Johnson), it was discovered that SCP-7371 is driven by four (4) different souls. Each soul has different memories, different lives, etc. However, all of the four (4) souls all have the same memories of working at a research company, experiencing a green flash, then being in the Foundation&#39;s custody. This suggests that some sort of incident occurred at this research company, prompting the souls to merge into one body. This explains the personality swaps as the souls fighting for control.

What causes the electromagnetic interference and why only one soul is in control now are still mysteries. Awaiting permission for further testing.

------

Post Interview SCP-7371-4 (conducted between SCP-7371 and Dr. William Joyface), SCP-7371 has taken up an intern medical position at Site-██, having Dr. Joyface as his supervisor. It seems that SCP-7371 has learned to temporarily halt his electromagnetic pulses for up to █ hours at a time. Doing so, however, seems to majorly degrade SCP-7371&#39;s energy. Greatly decreasing the amount of work he can get done, and increasing the strength required to halt the electromagnetic pulses. For this reason it is still mandatory that SCP-7371 returns to his containment chamber after every medical shift, and that his shifts be no longer than █ hours.

Despite these drawbacks, SCP-7371 seems to enjoy working for the Foundation, and hopes that he can be of great service and assistance. Further testing permission has been denied, we will request again in 2 weeks.
