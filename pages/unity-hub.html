One of the countless iterations of Earth in the multiverse, this planet is distinct because it completely lacks a veil separating the mundane from the supernatural. Here, monsters of legend mingle with humans as equal citizens, and magic is a part of everyone&#39;s lives, even if they aren&#39;t a mage.

[[tab Enotita]]

Enotita is the main setting of these stories. A country made up of all the islands and underwater settlements within the Eurasian Mediterranean Sea,  as well as the areas of Europe that correspond to Greece and Italy in our world. The country is a true melting pot, where citizens are treated equally regardless of their species, race, gender, religion, or orientation, and laws against bigotry protect citizen rights. Though this doesn&#39;t fully remove conflict between individuals along these lines, it does help society run smoother. Though nothing is stopping others from taking leadership roles, most government positions in Enotita are filled by gorgons, the species who founded Enotita centuries ago.

[[tab Magic]]

Magic utilizes a form of energy called magicka, which forms an ever-present field across all of the known universe and can be converted into almost any form of matter and energy by magi. Magic also forms the backbone of modern technology, with small components called runestones being used to convert magicka into energy, much the same as we use electricity. It&#39;s believed that magicka flows between dimensions, allowing those versed in magic to &#39;ride the waves&#39; between planes of existence. What&#39;s interesting about this is that, though magicka seems to have no problem flowing out of this universe or bringing things in, nothing can ride magicka out. Exactly why is a mystery.
