**Item #:** SCP-2452

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-2452 are to be contained in Anomalous Gallery 27, located at Site-09, and kept behind reinforced glass at all times. All personnel entering and leaving Anomalous Gallery 27 are to be logged by on-site security.

In the event that an instance of SCP-2452 is destroyed and SCP-2452-1 released, agents armed with suitable photographic equipment are to be dispatched to the homes of individuals portrayed in the destroyed instance. Upon engagement with SCP-2452-1, photographic equipment is to be used to re-contain SCP-2452-1 and any casualties explained to the public using Misinformation Campaign 24332-D (&#39;The ███████ Strangler&#39;). Any witnesses to an SCP-2452-1 attack are to be dosed with a Class-A amnestic.

**Description:** SCP-2452 is, as of the time of writing, a collection of fifty-two printed photographs taken by deceased photography student Adrian [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1891 Saul] in 20██. All but one instance of SCP-2452 portray crowded streets and analysis of the portrayed locations show that they were taken in Mr. Saul&#39;s local area of ███████. The only exception to this is a photographic self-portrait taken by Mr. Saul in his apartment.

SCP-2452-1 is a headless humanoid figure wrapped in bandages which appears in every instance of SCP-2452. SCP-2452-1 generally appears in the foreground of shots, often reaching towards the camera in a threatening manner. However, SCP-2452-1 has been known to change its position in SCP-2452 instances when they are not under observation.

SCP-2452-1 will only physically manifest outside of SCP-2452 when an instance of SCP-2452 is destroyed to a degree where the image is no longer visible. When this occurs, SCP-2452-1 will disappear from every instance of SCP-2452, as well as all copies, and physically manifest in the vicinity of an individual portrayed in the destroyed photograph. Note that although SCP-2452-1 is present in every instance of SCP-2452, only one entity appears during manifestation.

Upon manifestation, SCP-2452-1 will attempt to eliminate every individual portrayed in the destroyed instance of SCP-2452. It typically accomplishes this through strangulation, but has been known to use blunt force when this usual method is not possible. If SCP-2452-1 is killed during a manifestation, its body will disappear and a new instance of SCP-2452-1 will appear at its location within five to ten minutes.

Although SCP-2452-1 will appear in the vicinity of its first target, it will move on to other targets via normal ambulation, and as a result can be tracked down between killings. When SCP-2452-1 has eliminated all of its targets, its physical form will disappear and it will reappear in each instance of SCP-2452. The original destroyed instance of SCP-2452 will also repair itself, no matter what level of destruction it went through.

The only known method of ending an SCP-2452-1 manifestation early is by capturing its image via photography.[[footnote]] Video recordings of SCP-2452-1 do not appear to be effective, despite being made of countless frames of what are essentially photos. [[/footnote]] When this occurs, SCP-2452-1 will disappear in the same manner as it would after killing all its targets, and the photograph taken of it will become a new instance of SCP-2452. The original destroyed instance of SCP-2452 will still repair itself under such circumstances. 

SCP-2452 was discovered by police, along with Mr. Saul&#39;s strangled body, in his apartment after neighbors reported he had not been seen for several days. Analysis of the photographs and materials in Mr. Saul&#39;s apartment indicated anomalous activity had taken place, and the Foundation quickly took over the investigation and brought SCP-2452 into containment.
