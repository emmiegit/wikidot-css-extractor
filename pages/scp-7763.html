Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-7763 is to be kept in a standard containment locker. Access to SCP-7763 requires Level 2 clearance or higher. Testing involving SCP-7763 must be approved by the Site Director.

Description: SCP-7763 is a small, ornate wooden box measuring 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm. The exterior of the box is adorned with intricate carvings depicting various religious symbols and motifs, suggesting a wide range of cultural influences. The origin of SCP-7763 is currently unknown.

When SCP-7763 is opened, it reveals an empty interior. However, upon observing the contents of the box, individuals report seeing a personalized item of great sentimental value to them. The item perceived inside SCP-7763 varies widely and is often associated with positive memories or emotions. Common examples include photographs, letters, or small trinkets.

Further examination has revealed that the perceived items do not physically exist within SCP-7763. Testing has shown that multiple individuals can perceive different items simultaneously, tailored to their individual experiences and memories.

SCP-7763 appears to have a cognitohazardous effect, as individuals who interact with it develop a heightened sense of emotional well-being and nostalgia. This effect persists for approximately 24 hours after exposure to SCP-7763, after which individuals return to their baseline emotional state.
