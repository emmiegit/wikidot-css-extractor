SCP-5208 is the collective designation given to a series of events and anomalies related to SCP-5208-Ω, an Abrahamic-Thaumaturge and scientist by the name of Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (1852 – 1943). SCP-5208-Ω was a member of a secret esoteric suborder of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, known as the Knights of the Seventh Day (GOI-5208SD), a group tasked with using anomalous means to covertly promote the church&#39;s beliefs. SCP-5208-Ω&#39;s efforts to eliminate humanity&#39;s &#34;sinful vices&#34; emphasized sexual behavior, specifically masturbation. These efforts lead to the creation of SCP-5208-1, SCP-5208-2, and SCP-5208-3.

SCP-5208-1 is a 1.5-meter wooden staff featuring a crucifix, used as a conduit for thaumaturgic rituals designed by SCP-5208-Ω. Testing revealed that SCP-5208-1, in combination with specific verbal incantations, amplifies its user&#39;s thaumaturgic abilities. Analysis revealed SCP-5208-1 to be composed of Mauritian ebony (//Diospyros tessellaria//) treated with a mixture of ammonia and human blood later confirmed to belong to SCP-5208-Ω. SCP-5208-1 was used by SCP-5208-Ω during the creation of the SCP-5208-2 instances.

SCP-5208-2 are a species of non-corporeal humanoid Null-Class Demonic Entities[[footnote]] According to the Glymen Demonology Index, Null-Class Demonic entities are low-tier extra-spatial entities with various anomalous capabilities. Common abilities include telekinesis and cognitive influence. Most notably, these entities are usually given further abilities and augmentations through their commanding Marquis-Class or Princeps-Class Demonic Entities. Due to to the lack of ability to possesses hosts, Dux-Class Entities are typically non-corporeal.[[/footnote]] capable of parasitic propagation through human hosts. Instances of SCP-5208-2 display only rudimentary instinctual behavior, such as survival and procreation. Human individuals within a 3-meter radius of SCP-5208-2 will begin showing signs of increased libido; this effect increases as the distance decreases. Within 1 meter the effect of SCP-5208-2 begins showing one or more of the following symptoms:
* Hyperarousal
* Vascular engorgement of the genitals 
* Erection of the penis or mammary papilla
* Spontaneous ejaculation 
* Uncontrollable masturbation [[footnote]] Including masturbation with external objects.[[/footnote]]
* Heterosexual and homosexual intercourse[[footnote]]This can occur regardless of sexual orientation.[[/footnote]]
* Voraphilic and necrophillic behavior

Of these symptoms, uncontrollable masturbation is the most common, with more diverse symptoms manifesting with an increased presence of SCP-5208-2 instances. Prolonged exposure of a non-anomalous human to SCP-5208-2 instances causes a new SCP-5208-2 instance to manifest within the exposed person. After vomiting these new instances, the human hosts have an approximately 22% chance of developing long-term chronic exposure symptoms. SCP-5208-2 show an aversion to human subjects who have consumed a full serving of Kellogg&#39;s Corn Flakes with a 24-hour period before exposure. This aversion can be overcome when multiple SCP-5208-2 instances are present.

SCP-5208-Ω used SCP-5208-1 and at least 50 SCP-5208-2 instances to enact a combinatorial process that manifested a new entity. This new entity, designated SCP-5208-3, is a Princeps-Class Demonic Entity[[footnote]] According to the Glymen Demonology Index, Princeps-Class Demonic entities are high-tier extra-spatial entities with various anomalous capabilities. Notably common abilities include telekinesis, divination, compulsion, perception manipulation, and realty bending. Princeps-Class entities are typically in control of large groups of Marquis-Class and Dux-Class Demonic Entities.[[/footnote]] claiming the name Asmodeus. Measuring approximately 4 meters tall, SCP-5208-3 has a vaguely humanoid body consisting of a black viscous liquid of unidentifiable composition. SCP-5208-3 has been observed to be capable of speech, teleportation, telekinesis, telepathy, and the creation of new SCP-5208-2 instances[[footnote]]SCP-5208-2 instances created in this way will spontaneously erupt from within a nearby human, killing them in the process.[[/footnote]].

SCP-5208 was brought to the attention of the Foundation on 1927/2/23, by SCP-5208-Ω&#39;s biological brother and business partner, Will Keith Kellogg (1860 – 1951). SCP-5208-Ω and Mr. Kellogg directed the Battle Creek Sanitarium[[footnote]] A famous health resort in Battle Creek, Michigan, affiliated with the Seventh-Day Adventist Church.[[/footnote]] from 1876 to 1943; SCP-5208-Ω focused on his duties as a member of the GOI-5208SD and Mr. Kellogg directed the Sanitarium&#39;s superficial operations. Mr. Kellogg contacted the Foundation through their mutual acquaintance, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4677 Asa Candler], and a meeting was organized between Mr. Kellogg and Foundation Investigative Agent James Mueller.

**Audio Log Transcript**

**Date:** 1927/2/23

**Interviewer:** FIA James Mueller

**Interviewed:** Will Keith Kellogg
-----

[BEGIN LOG]

**Mueller:** Mr. Kellogg, are you ready to begin?

**Kellogg:** //Remains silent.//

**Mueller:** Is there an issue, sir?

**Kellogg:** I was told your organization practices discretion; I can&#39;t afford to be connected to this.

**Mueller:** Ah yes, rest assured this recording is for our records and nothing else. 

**Kellogg:** I suppose that&#39;s okay, if you insist. 

**Mueller:** Now, why have you called this meeting Mr. Kellogg? Mr. Candler spoke of an imminent threat.

**Kellogg:** It&#39;s my brother. I fear he is in over his head.

**Mueller:** You&#39;re going to need to be more specific, Mr. Kellogg.

**Kellogg:** My brother is  Dr. John Kellogg, he is the Director of the Battle Creek Sanitarium. He&#39;s been secretly working for a group called the Knights of the Seventh Day. He has been for a long time now, but things are different. He&#39;s changed.

**Mueller:** We have been investigating the organization for some time now. What–

**Kellogg:** He&#39;s not a bad man. They&#39;re trying to do good, I know they are. But this work, those cursed texts have corrupted him. He&#39;s blinded by devotion; he can&#39;t even see it all unraveling around him.

**Mueller:** What exactly is your brother&#39;s connection with this organization?

**Kellogg:** His position is known as a Knight Commander, one of seven as I understood it. He has been tasked with the elimination of the sin of lust. 

**Mueller:** As a concept?

**Kellogg:** As if I would know– I thought it was just a fraternity when I first learned of it years ago. It wasn&#39;t until the weird experiments started that I really saw they were doing. Magic, not your Houdini type magic mind you, but real magic. The last few years though...he&#39;s changed. He filled an entire wing at Battle Creek with victims of whatever is going on.

**Mueller:** Does your brother know of your... &#34;concerns&#34;?

**Kellogg:** He won&#39;t listen to me. I could only imagine what he would do if he found out I&#39;ve come to you for help.

**Mueller:** I understand, Mr. Kellogg. So, what exactly have you called this meeting to accomplish?

**Kellogg:** I don&#39;t want my brother getting hurt, not by you and certainly not by whatever he&#39;s gotten himself wrapped up in. I don&#39;t understand the esoteric ways of my brother, I never have– but your organization does, or so I have been told. 

**Mueller:** What exactly do you fear will happen to your brother?

**Kellogg:** The Church is demanding results; they think he&#39;s lost control of the situation and wants to see it rectified. I know my brother is planning something big and I just don&#39;t want anything happening to him. He&#39;s lost his way– I just want him guided back.

**Mueller:** I see. Mr. Kellogg, if you&#39;ll give me a moment I need to speak with my supervisor.

**Kellogg:** Will you help him? I&#39;m willing to pay, money is not a–

**Mueller:** Do not worry about a thing, we&#39;ll handle it from here.

**Afterword:** Will Kellogg was released under the condition that he assist the Foundation in containing SCP-5208. Following approval, a full-scale investigation of John Kellogg, Battle Creek Sanitarium, and the Knights of the Seventh Day was initiated.

Direct investigations into GOI-5208SD were successfully hindered by the effort of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church. Investigation Task Force Bravo-3 (&#34;Busy Bodies&#34;) was tasked with infiltrating the Battle Creek Sanitarium in order to covertly gather information on SCP-5208-Ω and GOI-5208SD. On 1927/3/19, ITF Bravo-3 successfully began its mission.

The four members of ITF Bravo-3 secured the following positions within the Battle Creek Sanitarium:
* Captain Richard Vanholt -- Night-Shift Security Captain
* Agent Nicholas Easton -- Day-Shift Security Guard
* Agent Sasha Fettle -- Day-Shift Orderly
* Agent Cornelius Thompson -- Night-Shift Security Guard

The sanitarium is run like a resort, though a large section is inaccessible by most staff and patrons. This section is known as Wing-K and is used by SCP-5208-Ω to conduct its research. SCP-5208-Ω hand-selects the personnel allowed to work within this section, Mr. Kellogg is unable to give the team access. All personnel and patrons are required to eat a bowl of cornflakes for breakfast daily.

On 1927/3/24, Agent Easton received a disciplinary mark from the Day-Shift Security Captain for inappropriate behavior. Agent Easton was &#34;getting fresh&#34; while attempting flirtation with several day-shift nurses. A review of Agent Easton&#39;s conduct will be conducted at the conclusion of this investigation.

The team is well situated in our positions but have been incapable of gaining entry to Wing-K. Samples of the cornflakes were taken but all testing revealed it to have no abnormal or anomalous properties.

Agent Fettle has formalized a complaint that Agent Easton attempted to force himself on her in an unwarranted sexual advance. Whether this is an effect of the anomaly we are investigating, or a lack of proper conduct is currently unknown. Agent Vanholt notes that situations like this are why he was apprehensive regarding the inclusion of women on ITF teams. 

The team discovered an array of thaumaturgic symbols surrounding the Battle Creek Sanitarium. The symbols were etched and carved into trees and stones every 3 meters.

* 15 Orderlies
* 58 rooms
* 47 Patients 
* 8 restricted rooms

Unlike the rest of the sanitarium Wing K looks like a traditional medical wing found in most asylums.  All Wing K personnel are required to eat cornflakes for every meal and communication between personnel is strictly forbidden barring work-related duties. Agent Vanholt is scheduled to receive a tour of the Wing K facilities by SCP-5208-Ω itself, he will attempt to record this encounter.

**Vanholt:** Hello sir, it is an honor to finally make your acquaintance.

**SCP-5208-Ω:** Undoubtedly, Mr. Cornwall.

**Vanholt:** I would like to thank you for giving me this opportunity.

**SCP-5208-Ω:** With my brother&#39;s recommendation and a résumé as exemplary as your own, how could I not?

//[Both chuckle]//

**SCP-5208-Ω:** Let us begin, follow me. Are you a man of God, Mr. Cornwall?

**Vanholt:** Of course, Dr. Kellogg.

**SCP-5208-Ω:** Then I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware this great nation of ours is plagued with ungodliness. Sin running rampant through the streets. Children growing up to never know the love of our Lord and savior– it is our mission here to overturn this complacency, to drag this nation into the light of our lord.

**Vanholt:** I am unsure I understand, sir.

**SCP-5208-Ω:** Outside of this wing what does the sanitarium offer its patrons?

**Vanholt:** I don–

**SCP-5208-Ω:** Clarity! We offer them clarity, of body and mind. Here though, here is where we offer them clarity of the soul.

**Vanholt:** How exactly do we do that?

**SCP-5208-Ω:** By ridding them of the very root of all man&#39;s ailments, sin.

**Vanholt:** That sure sounds swell doctor, but how does that work?

**SCP-5208-Ω:** Oh so eager, fine Mr. Cornwall, allow me to demonstrate. Right through here, please.

**Vanholt:** What in the he– 

**SCP-5208-Ω:** Welcome, I&#39;m fairly certain you are well acquainted with my brother. 

**Kellogg:** Please John, I&#39;m begging you, I only meant to help! I was trying to sav–

**SCP-5208-Ω:** Silence! I will not stand one more treacherous word from your mouth!

**Vanholt:** Get your hands off me– //[The sounds of chains rattling can be heard as Agent Vanholt is presumably restrained.]//

**SCP-5208-Ω:** So the Knights are finally making their move against me. After all I have done, everything I&#39;ve accomplished! 

**Kellogg:** Please brother, this has gone far enough you need to stop!

**SCP-5208-Ω:** You brought them here! Your jealousy, your pride, and your arrogance has turned you against me. Worry not brother, you will witness me finish what I have started– one final ritual to rid the world of lust. 

//[SCP-5208-Ω begins chanting in an unknown language, Mr. Kellogg can be heard screaming incoherently.]//

&#34;Battle Creek has descended into madness.&#34; SCP-5208-Ω has been wandering the halls, without clothing, using a staff(SCP-5208-1) to create new SCP-5208-2 instances by striking the patients. This group of SCP-5208-2 instances gathered in the courtyard, participating in a voraphilic ritual with SCP-5208-Ω and the Wing K orderlies. &#34;They created something terrible. It’s turned this whole place topsy-turvy, it&#39;s a bloodbath, a massacre, an orgy. Please, send help.&#34; Hostile entities are noted as incorporeal and do not respond to standard ammunition or blunt force trauma.

-----
**__Squad 1__**

[BEGIN LOG]

**Z1/1:** Entering the eastern wing now. 

**z1/2:** Copy that, entering Southwest wing– switching channels.

//[A cacophony of screams and moans can be heard as Squad 1 enters the sanitarium]//

**Z1/1:** Alright folks, we have an unknown amount of hostile entities and about 300 civilians. Call out your targets– we don&#39;t want any unnecessary casualties. 

//[Squad 1 can be heard giving various affirmations.]//

**Z1/3:** //[Sound of a wooden door scraping open]// This way, Wing K should be at the end of this corridor. 

**Z1/1:** Three and Six, you take the lead. Four and Five, cover the rear.

**Z1/3:** Look alive, we have company.

**Z1/6:** This broad isn&#39;t wearing any clothes.

**Z1/1:** Leave her, concealment will take care of the civilians once we&#39;ve cleared the area.

**Civilian:** You want a lick, daddy?

**Z1/3:** Hey hands off lady, the fuck is wrong with you.

**Z1/1:** Just keep it moving.

//[Civilian can be heard screaming incoherently.]//

**Z1/2:** Made contact with hostiles. Thaumic rounds work swell, just don&#39;t stand too close when you shoot them– might get a little heated.

**Z1/1:** Copy that. Good to know, Two. 

**Z1/5:** Hostile incoming, six o&#39;clock. 

//[Gunshots can be heard followed by the roar of a flame.]//

**Z1/6:** Well ain&#39;t that the bee&#39;s knees. This is going to be a cakewalk. 

**Z1/1:** Let&#39;s not start counting our chickens just yet. How much further Three?

**Z1/3:** That door right up there should be Wing K.

------

**__Squad 2__:**

**Z1/2:** Keep an eye out, we should be getting close.

**Z1/7:** One more broad asks to touch my johnson and I&#39;ll be half inclined to let &#39;em. 

**Z1/10:** About the only way you&#39;ll see any action at all. 

//[Laughter.]//

**Z1/8:** Woah, hold it guys– we&#39;re here. See, &#34;Female Staff Dormitories.&#34; Fettle should be through here.

**Z1/2:** Nine, Ten you stay here and guard the door. Everyone else on me. 

//[Moaning and the sound of bed frames squeezing can be heard.]//

**Z1/8:** We got 3 civilia– Christ. We got 2 civilians 3 hostiles, and a– corpse.

//[Sound of a door breaking down followed by 3 gunshots.]//

**Z1/7:** We don&#39;t have time for gawking Eight. 

**Z1/2:** Let&#39;s keep moving, put &#39;em down as you see &#39;em.

**Z1/8:** Look, there&#39;s a field code on this door.

**Z1/2:** //[Sound of a door creaking open.]// Agent Fettle, are you in here?

**Fettle:** What&#39;re the safe words?

**Z1/2:** Orange, Centipede, West.

 //[Sound of a door unlocking and quickly swinging open.]//

**Fettle:** Well it&#39;s about time. Wait– this isn&#39;t the whole response team, is it?

**Z1/2:** No– we&#39;re Squad 2, Squad 1 is handling Wing K.

**Fettle:** Wing K? Please tell me there&#39;s more than 3 of them.

**Z1/7:** 5-man squad, just like us.

**Fettle:** That&#39;s not enough– they&#39;ve got to get out of there!

**Z1/7:** Don&#39;t worry sweetheart, they&#39;re well trained. Besides, these shadow entities are a cakewalk.

**Fettle:**  They&#39;re not the only thing here, you have to warn them!

**Z1/2:** Squad 1, do you copy? Squad 1, come in. Captain? Shit. 

**Fettle:** It&#39;s already too late, isn&#39;t it?

**Z1/2:** We need to stay on task, Squad 1 has their mission and we have ours. Do you have any idea where the rest of your team is, Agent Fettle?

**Fettle:** Thompson&#39;s out. Dead. Vanholt and Easton&#39;s last known location was... Wing K.

**Z1/2:** Eight, give Agent Fettle your sidearm and some ammunition. Let&#39;s pay Squad 1 a visit. 
------
**__Squad 1__**

**Z1/2:** Squad 1, //[Static]// copy? //[Static]//6, come in. Captain?

**Z1/1:** There&#39;s interference, Two. Can you repeat?

**Z1/3:** Cap, come look.

**Z1/4:** Looks like some sort of containment room, it&#39;s got to be.

//[An airlock release can be heard as Squad 1 enters the room.]//

**Z1/6:** Hands up! Turn around slowly.

**Vanholt:** Gosh am I glad to see you, boys.

**Z1/1:** Guns down– he&#39;s one of ours. Captain, it&#39;s swell to see you&#39;ve made it.

**Vanholt:** As I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen, this place has gone to hell in a handbag.

**Z1/1:** Where is the rest of your team?

**Vanholt:** A few of the orderlies... Th–they ate Easton. I... I don&#39;t know what happened to Fettle or Thompson.

**Z1/1:** Okay. We should keep moving.

**Vanholt:** Wait Captain, how much of the situation are you aware of?

**Z1/1:** We&#39;ve seen hostile entities, taken them out. Thaumic rounds work wonders. 

**Vanholt:** Have you seen it? The big one?

**Z1/1:** We have not. We are to capture the main anomaly and Dr. Kellogg.

**Vanholt:** So before Kellogg created those things, he had a plan. As far as I can tell from his notes, this room was meant to contain the entity.

**Z1/1:** If you&#39;re saying Kellogg meant to capture the entity, why hasn&#39;t he?

**Vanholt:** He doesn&#39;t have the presence of mind left to tie his shoelaces, let alone fight that thing. It&#39;s been parading him around on a leash.

**Z1/1:** Last known location? 

**Vanholt:** The chapel, it&#39;s just down the hall.

**Z1/1:** Okay– tell us everything you know about this room and the entity. 
-----
**__Squad 2__**

**Fettle:** Okay, this is it– Wing K.

**Z1/2:** Right, look alive. 

//[Shouting can be heard from down the corridor, followed by gunshots.]//

**Z1/7:** Looks like Squad 1 has already engaged the entity.

**Z1/2:** Nine and Ten, scrawl out an 8 Trigram Seal on this door. I don&#39;t want anything in or out.

**Z1/9:** You got it, boss.

**Z1/2:** Seven and Eight, rendezvous with Squad 1. Agent Fettle, you&#39;re with me, let&#39;s see if we can find your team.

**SCP-5208-3:** You dare disturb Asmodeus! 

//[A loud crashing noise followed by shouting can be heard.]//

**Z1/8:** Holy fuck, what is that?
-----
**__Squad 1 &amp; Squad 2__**

//[The sound of running can be heard.]//

**Z1/3:** Captain look, it&#39;s Squad 2.

**Z1/1:** Well aren&#39;t you a sight for sore eyes. 

**Z1/2:** The doors sealed behind us. What&#39;s the plan?

**Z1/1:** We need to get it inside this room.

**Z1/2:** How do you– //[Z1/2 is interrupted by a loud crunching noise, followed by a thud as his body hits the ground.]//

**SCP-5208-3:** I found you. //[Inhuman laughter]//

**Z1/4:** //[Screaming]// It’s in my head– I can&#39;t– I– //[Unknown]//.

//[Indistinguishable shouting can be heard. The laughter continues followed by several wet popping sounds.]//

**Z1/1:** Everyone in this room, now!

**SCP-5208-3:** You can&#39;t hide from me! I am inside your heads, inside your hearts, inside your coc–

**Z1/1:** Flip the fucking switch Vanholt! What are you wai–  //[Z1/1 is interrupted by a loud buzzing noise followed by inhuman screaming]//

//[The roar of a large fire can be heard.]//

Two-hours after MSF Zulu-1 entered the Battle Creek Sanitarium, several fires broke out across the facility as all SCP-5208-2 instances erupted into flames. Of the 286 civilians within the sanitarium, 192 survived with 161 listed as injured casualties. Amongst the survivors both SCP-5208-Ω and Mr. Kellogg survived, with SCP-5208-Ω sustaining irreparable brain damage during the event. MSF Zulu-1 was able to recover Captain Vanholt, Agent Fettle, SCP-5208-1, and several documents relating to GOI-5208SD[[footnote]]These documents are available to personnel with Level/5 Clearance at Site-51&#39;s Archive. [[/footnote]]. All survivors and civilian witnesses were amnestisized and Cover Story-BK79 (Faulty Gas Valve) was enacted.

Due to SCP-5208-Ω&#39;s brain damage and in accordance with the Foundation agreement with Mr. Kellogg, SCP-5208-Ω was administered YM-Grade amnestics and released into the custody of Mr. Kellogg. All public information pertaining to SCP-5208-Ω&#39;s involvement with GOI-5208SD was destroyed or confiscated. In return, Mr. Kellogg transferred a 10% holding of The Kellogg Company to the Foundation.
