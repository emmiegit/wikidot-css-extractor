&gt; +++++ Don&#39;t Exist: A Sestina to a Fossil
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the painlessness haze of opium
&gt; Mary lay in bed staring at a lithograph on
&gt; the floor. A plesiosaur skeleton. Once hers. Now nailed to the wall
&gt; of a museum. The cold crept through her blanket
&gt; slithering through the closed windows. And Amon
&gt; was there among the forgotten curios.
&gt; 
&gt; He stood there a curiosity among curiosities
&gt; The knickknacks collected dust. Maybe it was just the opium.
&gt; Lovingly scanning the empty shells and skulls Amon
&gt; said “This is a lovely find.” She kept on
&gt; as she was, still curled under the blanket,
&gt; infantile. “There’s nothing there,” she said, “Just the creaking of the wall.
&gt; 
&gt; Just the creaking of the wall and the wail
&gt; of March&#39;s winds,” The museum empty of its prizes. The curator
&gt; remained; she clutched the blanket
&gt; as her life ebbed out, soothed by the tincture of opium’s
&gt; quiet numbness. She remembered the plesiosaur found on
&gt; the sea shore among the ammonites.
&gt; 
&gt; She looked at the man again. He grew curled ram’s horns. Amon
&gt; knelt down beside her. “All of your life you chipped at a wall,
&gt; poor woman, never stopping.” What is he on
&gt; about? She thought in the haze. My life’s work has been a curiosity
&gt; for the gentry and gossipers. They used me. The tincture of opium
&gt; sat on the table, reflecting the dunes of blanket.
&gt; 
&gt; “Don’t think like that. The animals that blanketed
&gt; the old Earth with their remains will be remembered,” Amon
&gt; said, “The diggers remembered in myth,” Her heart slowed its oscillations,
&gt; calming her tumor-nestled chest. The dead sat on the wall
&gt; staring down at their captor who would join them before cure
&gt; or treatment. &#34;Don’t taunt a dying woman, you’re having me on.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; He turned away. The horns on
&gt; his head disrupted the dust blanketing
&gt; the shelves. Hundreds of unsold crusts
&gt; and coprolites sat clean. Seeking amnesty
&gt; for grave robbing she sighed. Her eyes walled
&gt; shut. Where is that opium?
&gt; 
&gt; Ammonites are cured on the bottoms of shallow seas and become Amon.
&gt; A woman sells seashells on the seashore and runs into a wall.
&gt; The neighbors come, remark on the opium and wrap her in final blankets

------


&gt; //&#34;She sells seashells by the seashore.
&gt; The shells she sells are surely seashells.
&gt; So if she sells shells on the seashore,
&gt; I&#39;m sure she sells seashore shells.&#34;//

&gt; People in nursery rhymes don&#39;t exist. Did they ever?</textarea></pre>
