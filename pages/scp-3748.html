**Item #:** SCP-3748

**Object Class:** Insectoid/Telepathic

**Containment Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3748 is to be contained in a standard containment cell, containing basic humanoid amenities downsized to SCP-3748&#39;s scale. The walls of SCP-3748&#39;s containment chamber are to be made at least five meters thick, and no open spaces are allowed within five meters of SCP-3748&#39;s cell.

Staff who receive Level 2 authorization may speak with SCP-3748. However, potential interviewers are to be warned that SCP-3748 has an exceptionally vitriolic personalty.

**Description:** SCP-3748 is a ceramic bowl containing approximately 600 //Musca domestica//[[footnote]]Better known as the housefly.[[/footnote]] cadavers. These cadavers can be removed from SCP-3748, though it expresses discomfort when this happens. SCP-3748 will regenerate at a rate of one fly every three minutes if a portion is removed.

SCP-3748 has developed a sapient consciousness fluent in English and knows very basic Japanese. SCP-3748&#39;s primary method of communication is telepathy, where it speaks in a male Midwest American accent. This telepathy is not two-way; however, SCP-3748 has a sense of hearing despite not possessing hearing apparatuses.

SCP-3748&#39;s primary mode of translocation is teleportation. SCP-3748 is capable of instantaneously transporting itself up to approximately 4.78 meters at a time. SCP-3748 can do this four times in a minute before showing signs of exhaustion; however, SCP-3748 has implied on multiple occasions that it could teleport itself more if it exercised.

**Discovery:** SCP-3748 was created by PoI-2343 (Jacob Sherman) for his school&#39;s science fair. PoI-2343 supposedly put a piece of flypaper into a ceramic bowl, and left it outside until a great number of flies accrued in the bowl. PoI-2343 did not create SCP-3748 intentionally, and it is believed that neither PoI-2343 nor any members of his immediate family have reality-altering capabilities. The flypaper used to create SCP-3748 has not been recovered.

&gt; **Interviewed:** PoI-2343
&gt;
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Sarah Clemson
&gt; -----
&gt; //&lt;Begin Log&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** Hello, Jacob. How are you feeling today?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-2343:** I&#39;m doing great!
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** That&#39;s good to hear. Last month you had a science fair at your school, correct?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-2343:** Yup.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** What was your project for the science fair?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-2343:** Well, I put two bowls with flypaper in them in two different places, one out in the sun, and one inside near an open window for a couple hours. I was gonna see the difference in flies collected in the bowl if the bowl was inside versus outside.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** When did you discover the bowl&#39;s properties?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-2343:** A day before the fair. I was checking up on both of the bowls to see what I caught. The bowl outside collected way more flies than the other. //Way// more. Anyway, I was gonna bring the outside bowl back inside, when I heard someone say, &#34;It smells in here.&#34; It came from the bowl of dead flies.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** What did it say to you?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-2343:** Well, it really scared me. I went over to pick it up, and it said &#34;Hey, kid, over here, give me a hand?&#34; and &#34;If you could get rid of this flypaper that would be great.&#34; It was weird too, it spoke without a mouth, and I heard it talking in my head. It didn&#39;t have any ears either, but it could hear me. 
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-2343:** Anyway, I accidentally threw it off the table. Uh, then we talked for a bit after I calmed down. It said that it was a &#34;nice and friendly&#34; person, talked about how it got all the ladies, and how everyone thought he was the best.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** What did you do after that?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-2343:** Actually, we had a conversation about picking up girls. He told me he could be my wingman, show me the ropes on how to score one, how to be smooth and all that. I really didn&#39;t know what he was doing, but I was, and still am, an awkward high school student, so I listened. Once I got past him being, uh, odd, we actually became good friends as well, and we would have conversations with each other when nobody was looking. I didn&#39;t tell anyone about it, because I was literally asking for dating advice from a bowl of dead flies. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** I see. Anything else of note before we acquired it?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-2343:** It told me it was good at video games, so I gave it my computer so that &#34;he could teach me.&#34; It teleported all over the keyboard and pressed a bunch of random buttons, and he used all of my items at once, and jumped off a cliff. He told me my keyboard sucked.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** Hmm, I see. This interview is over. Thank you for cooperating, Jacob.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-2343:** No problem. Where is Bernard, anyways?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** We&#39;re checking him at the moment. You&#39;ll be reunited shortly.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-2343:** Thanks, ma&#39;am.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;End Log&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Closing Statement:** PoI-2343 was administered Class-C amnestics and released back into public.

&gt;
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Sarah Clemson
&gt; -----
&gt; //&lt;Begin Log&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** Hello, my good madam.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** Good afternoon, SCP-3748. If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;m going to be asking you several questions.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** Knock yourself out.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** Do you know who created, or made you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** What are your hobbies?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** SCP-3748, please answer my question.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** Oh, I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s just a quirk of mine.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** Maybe after you answer my questions, okay? Now, who created you, SCP-3748?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** Some stupid kid. What do you do for a living?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** I&#39;d appreciate it if you stopped asking me questions.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** Sorry, so sorry. I just wanted to get to know you better.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** The purpose of this interview is to gain information about you. Now-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** //&lt;Interrupting&gt;// Okay, wow. I was just asking you a question, and you shoot me down like that. No reason to bitch about it. Like, a simple answer would have sufficed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** Please be civil, SCP-3748.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** It&#39;s always &#34;SCP-3748&#34;, isn&#39;t it? Why not use my actual name, bitch? I&#39;m trying to be respectful and all here, but then you just go and straight up fuck me over for no reason.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** SCP-3748, please remain civil. Now, tell-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** Oh, I see. Just because I&#39;m a bowl of flies, you think you can kick me to the curb? Leave me on the backburner, huh? Just because I&#39;m an &#39;anomaly&#39;? Well, you should go fuck yourself, bitch. Jesus, what a whore.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Silence&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** This interview is over.
&gt; 
&gt; //Researcher Clemson stands up//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** No! That was my brother! I&#39;m actually a-
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;SCP-3748 appears to weep. Water appears to leak from the top of the bowl&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m so sorry. I&#39;m a piece of shit.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** Huh?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** I&#39;m a piece of shit that doesn&#39;t deserve to be loved. I&#39;m only pretending to be cool to mask the fact that I&#39;m not. People hate me, but I can&#39;t stop the act because people will hate me even more! I don&#39;t know what to do.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Researcher Clemson sits down&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** Can you answer my questions now?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** //Sniff.// Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** Do you know who created you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** //Sigh.// A kid. I think his name was Sherman. I lied to him that I was a hit with the ladies. Because of course I do, why else would a subhuman like me survive in this world? I&#39;m not gonna hit it up with anyone, nobody is going to spend the time with me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** Stay on topic, SCP-3748.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** Sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** Anyway. Do you have any memory of before you were created?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** Uh... no. No. Probably was still a loser though.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** Okay. The child said your name was Bernard, is that correct?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** Okay. One last question. Do you know how you are able to talk and see?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** I don&#39;t know. I can see, breathe, smell, and hear perfectly. I don&#39;t know.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;SCP-3748 appears to sob again, but less severely&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** Sorry that I don&#39;t know anything.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** It&#39;s fine. You&#39;ve given us enough information. Any thing to say before I conclude this interview?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** Yeah. Um... do you want to hang out sometime? Maybe grab some coffee? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** SCP-3748, I&#39;m marri-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3748:** Wow! Because //of course// you are, you raging slutbag. I even apologized and submitted myself to you and this is what you say to me? You wouldn&#39;t know chivalry if it bit you on the—
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Clemson:** This interview is over. 
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;End Log&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Closing Statement:** For approximately 2 hours after the interview,  SCP-3748 continued to yell several profanities directed towards Researcher Clemson before eventually calming down.
