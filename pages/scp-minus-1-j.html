**Item #:** SCP-(-1)-J

**Containment Class:** --Safe-- --Thaumiel-- Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-(-1)-J was to have been kept in a containment cell approximately 5 meters on all sides and protected by 20 members of MTF-Nabla-24 &#34;Ice Behrs&#34; at all times.

**Description:** SCP-(-1)-J designated a Krylon-brand aerosol can, containing approximately a half litre of a paint-like substance, designated SCP-(-1)-J-β. This paint-like substance was approximately 20% the mass of ordinary paint. In coloration, the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance was colorless and odorless. It was approximately 100% transparent. When applied to a surface or mixed into a substance, the object was able to be seen clearly through, with the same diffraction as the surrounding environment (be it air, water, or vacuum) as if it didn&#39;t exist at all. How this process occurred is not known.

**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied to a wooden plank.

**Result:** Wooden plank became invisible.

**Notes:** //Wooden plank incinerated due to being a tripping hazard.//

------

**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be stirred into water.

**Result:** Water became invisible.

**Notes:** //Water exposed to SCP-(-1)-J-β tastes like ordinary paint water.//

------

**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied to a sheet of lead approximately 1 meter in height and width, and approximately 5 centimeters in thickness. After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for radiation blocking capabilities.

**Result:** Lead became invisible.

**Notes:** //D-Class personnel reported feeling &#34;itchy&#34; and &#34;lightheaded&#34; while the lead sheet stood between her and a sample of Krypton-85 approximately 10 kilograms in weight. Cause of symptoms unknown.//

------

**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied to a steel M1 helmet. After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for ballistic protection capabilities.

**Result:** Helmet became invisible.

**Notes:** //No paint flaked off of the helmet upon being shot repeatedly with pistol caliber ammunition. Helmet did appear to be dented from tactile examination. D-Class sustained concussion.//

------

**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied to a printed copy of a memetic kill agent. After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for memetic kill capabilities.

**Result:** Meme became invisible.

**Notes:** //D-Class tester reported no effects, save for confusion. D-Class terminated by facility guard anyway to maintain regular quota.//

------

**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied to the body of [[[SCP-096]]] (&#34;The Shy Guy&#34;). After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for reaction.

**Result:** SCP-096 became invisible.

**Notes:** //D-Class tester told to stare in the direction of SCP-096, but was not attacked. Upon the success of this test, SCP-096 has been released out into the world due to no longer posing any threat whatsoever and being completely harmless. SCP-(-1)-J reclassified to Thaumiel.//

------

**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied to [[[SCP-049]]] (&#34;The Plague Doctor&#34;). After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for reaction.

**Result:** SCP-049 became invisible.

**Notes:** //The present location of SCP-049 is unknown. Several staff have dropped dead and become zombies. It is unknown if these phenomena are linked.//

------

Parameters : The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied to a piece of paper containing the written designation of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2521 entity symbolized by ●●/●●●●●/●●/●] . After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for provocation ability.

**Result:** Paper became invisible.

**Notes:** //●●/●●●●●/●●/● manifested inside of the testing chamber, became confused, and left, but not before grabbing the D-Class tester present anyway. We&#39;re pretty sure it doesn&#39;t know about this entry.//

------

**Parameters:** The paint was to be applied to [[[SCP-___-J]]].

**Result:** The object was affected.

**Notes:** Write later.

------

**Parameters:**  The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied to approximately one pill of [[[SCP-500]]] (&#34;The Panacea&#34;). After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for efficacy.

**Result:** SCP-500 pill became invisible.

**Notes:** //Location of pill unknown. Possibly dropped in transfer from testing chamber.//

------

**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied to the body of [[[SCP-347]]] (&#34;The Invisible Woman&#34;). After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for reaction.

**Result:** Unknown.

**Notes:** //Researcher K has reported that his car keys went missing some time during the test. Possibly leakage of paint?//

------

**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied the body of an instance of [[[SCP-363]]] (&#34;Not Centipedes&#34;). After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for reaction, ostensibly.

**Result:** Ostensibly, the SCP-363 instance became invisible.

**Notes:** //Due to no light touching the instance, the instance ostensibly mutated rapidly and breached containment. Ostensibly 12 dead, and ostensibly 53 wounded. Location unknown.//

------

**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied the body of [[[SCP-682]]] (&#34;Hard-to-Kill Reptile&#34;). After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for reaction.

**Result:** SCP-682 instance became invisible.

**Notes:** //SCP-682 is no longer detected, and is presumed to be Neutralized. D-Class positioned in the testing chamber also disappeared, the reason for this is unknown.//

------

**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied the body of [[[SCP-173]]] (&#34;The Statue&#34;). After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for reaction.

**Result:** N/A (See Below.)
