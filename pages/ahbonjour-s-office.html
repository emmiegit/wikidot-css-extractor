    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>Her office is warm and full, and the first thing you notice is that it smells like oranges. Oranges and lemons? Citrus in general, but citrus that has been boiled in apple cider and cinnamon, warm and comforting in your belly. Her office smells like Christmastime even in the height of July. Her office smells like coming home.

She&#39;s not there at the moment, but that doesn&#39;t matter since she left the door unlocked. &#34;If the door is unlocked,&#34; she tells all of the junior researchers and new hires, &#34;then you can come in and make yourself some tea. You can leave what I need to look at on my desk, or you can wait for me to come back, I don&#39;t mind either way.&#34; 

She keeps a small table off to the side for her tea accouterments, including an electric kettle, a teapot, sugar cubes, and several varieties of loose leaf. You decide some tea might be nice, and you empty a bottle of water into the kettle and flick it on.

There are lots of things to look at while you&#39;re waiting for the water to boil. What would you like to look at first?

[[tab Her corkboard]]
She&#39;s pretty open about the projects she&#39;s working on and keeps a bulletin board with reminders about them on one of her walls. She pins them up with little novelty pins from truck stops, little buttons with pithy sayings like &#34;I Left My Heart in Michigan&#34; and &#34;Save a Horse, Ride a Texan&#34;. Do you want to pick one up?

[[collapsible show=&#34;No&#34; hide=&#34;No&#34;]]
You wisely decide to just read the papers, and not fiddle with &#34;KEEP CALM and EAT PEACHES, Georgia&#34;

The picture makes you pause. Was that really her? Must have been a long time ago. That hardly looks like the same person now.

You don&#39;t notice anything else interesting and decide to look elsewhere.[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;Yes&#34; hide=&#34;Yes&#34;]]
You pluck one of the pushpins off the corkboard without thinking and several papers drop to the ground, making a mess out of her floor. Look what you&#39;ve done now! You are very clumsy. And all because you wanted to get a closer look at &#34;Live Well, Laugh Often, Drink More Wine, California&#34;. You read the papers while you&#39;re picking them up.

The picture makes you pause. Was that really her? Must have been a long time ago. That hardly looks like the same person now.

You pick the papers up and stand to tack them back on when you see a piece of paper stapled to the board that must have been covered by the papers you just dropped. It says:
&gt; **Dr. Emile Bonjour**
&gt; **Head Researcher on:**
&gt; * SCP-████

The rest of the paper is ripped away. You get the feeling you were not supposed to have seen this, so you tack the papers back up and turn your attention elsewhere.

[[tab Her record collection]]
The collection is about half records and half CDs, with a couple of tapes tucked in the back. She has a gramophone but no CD player; you assume she must play those on her computer. Which ones do you want to look at?

[[collapsible show=&#34;The records&#34; hide=&#34;The records&#34;]]
The records are all older music, things that probably had CDs by now, but for whatever reason, she held onto the records. Why? Sentimentality? A few of them catch your eye as you flick through them.

* //Revolver//, The Beatles
* //Licensed to Ill//, The Beastie Boys
* //Follies//, Original Broadway Cast, 1971
* //Ziggy Stardust//, David Bowie
* //Pippin//, Original Broadway Cast, 1972

The rest of them don&#39;t interest you. [[/collapsible]]

------

[[collapsible show=&#34;The CDs&#34; hide=&#34;The CDs&#34;]]
The CDs all look like a bit more modern music, some things that only just came out, some things that are a bit older, scratched up around the edges. You doubt those still play. A few of them catch your eye as you flick through them.

* //Warrior//, Ke$ha
* //Les Miserables//, Original West End Cast, 1985
* //Babel//, Mumford &amp; Sons
* //When I Was Cruel//, Elvis Costello
* //Legally Blonde: The Musical//, Original Broadway Cast, 2007

The rest of them don&#39;t interest you. [[/collapsible]]

------

[[collapsible show=&#34;The tapes&#34; hide=&#34;The tapes&#34;]]
There are three tapes, and only two of them are for music. The ones with music on them are both Christmas-themed, with names written on the side of them in ballpoint pen: &#34;Many Times Many Ways&#34; and &#34;Mayor Daisby, Marion Bright&#34;. 

The third tape is the kind you would put in a camcorder, roughly the same size as the Christmas tapes, but on the side of it is written &#34;SCP-████ Interview Logs&#34;. The SCP&#39;s number has been blacked out with a marker. You look around for a way to play it, and when you can&#39;t see one, wisely decide to put it back.[[/collapsible]]
[[/tab]]
[[tab Her bookshelf]]
Her bookshelf is divided into two sections: fiction and nonfiction. Fiction is on the top shelves, and the books there are worn and well-loved, dust-free and several of them with cracked spines and sticky notes sticking out of them. The nonfiction texts are largely medical and scientific journals on her field, but these are in significantly better condition than the fiction books. The ones on the bottom look like she hasn&#39;t touched them since grad school.

What would you like to look at first?

[[collapsible show=&#34;Fiction&#34; hide=&#34;Fiction&#34;]]
Many of the books look like they&#39;ve been through the wringer: spines cracked, covers eroded, pages torn around the edges. She doesn&#39;t take good care of her books. What a shame. You can still read the spines on some of them.

* //The World According to Garp//, John Irving
* //The Selection// series, Kiera Cass
* //Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth//, written by Grant Morrison, illustrated by Dave McKean
* //Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ&#39;s Childhood Pal//, Christopher Moore
* //Who&#39;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?//, Edward Albee [[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;Nonfiction&#34; hide=&#34;Nonfiction&#34;]]
You scan the medical and scientific texts, none of them catching your attention for more than a moment. Many of them have gone unused for months, maybe years. She must do a lot of online research.

As you&#39;re flicking through &#34;//Captive Audience: The Science and Damaging Effects Behind America&#39;s Prison System//&#34;, you find a photograph. It&#39;s tucked between pages, somewhere no one but a snoop would find it.

The person in the photograph (you can&#39;t determine a gender) is smiling and has flour on their face. They&#39;re holding a book, but you can&#39;t decipher which one. The two things you can see very clearly are their eyes, bright and sparkling, dark brown and amber-ringed. Their hair is brown on the sides but a lovely light lavender on top, and you feel like you&#39;ve seen this person before. They must be Dr. Bonjour&#39;s partner, you can see the ring on their finger, but you can&#39;t shake the feeling that you&#39;ve seen them somewhere else. You put the picture back in the book and slide it back onto the shelf.[[/collapsible]]
[[/tab]]
[[tab Her index cards]]
Dr. Bonjour keeps a running tally of stats on her wall, index cards with percentages and numbers, which makes you laugh. She always says &#34;you&#39;re only as good as your last project&#34;, and likes to remind herself of that. 

[[module ListPages created_by=&#34;ahbonjour&#34; separate=&#34;no&#34; perPage=&#34;250&#34; prependLine=&#34;||~ File ||~ Rating ||~ Comments ||~ Created ||~ Last Comment ||~ Length ||&#34;]]
|| %%title_linked%% || %%rating%% || %%comments%% || %%created_at%% || %%commented_at%% || %%size%% ||
[[/module]]

Only as good as your last project. She&#39;s so competitive! Still, maybe it helps. [[collapsible show=&#34;.&#34; hide=&#34;--what&#39;s that?&#34;]]

There&#39;s an additional index card on the ground, wedged between the warped baseboard and the umber drywall. It&#39;s covered in scribbles and marks, worn by repeated attacks from an eraser. Under the mess, you can barely read the words &#34;SCP-████&#34;. What is this thing? You&#39;re not sure what to do with the card, so you just put it back.[[/collapsible]]
[[/tab]]
[[tab I&#39;m done looking around]]

You feel like you&#39;ve done enough snooping and you should probably get back to work. You drop the papers you brought her on her desk an open folder catches your eye.

&gt; **Name:** Dr. Emile Bonjour
&gt; **Security Clearance:** Level 3
&gt; **Specialization:** Early childhood development, dramatic and visual arts, psychology
&gt; **Subspecialization:** Crepes

That makes you laugh as the kettle begins whistling. You absentmindedly pick up the file and carry it with you as you begin making tea.

&gt; **History**: Emile Bonjour was recruited from her position as a teacher at Sunnycare Day School in ██████, OK, after one of her students began displaying anomalous properties. Dr. Bonjour reacted with the grace and aptitude expected of a Foundation researcher rather than a preschool educator, and after verifying her background and credentials, human resources elected to offer her a position as a junior researcher. She rose through the ranks

You lose your grip on the spoon and send tea leaves flying everywhere. You swear, drop the file, and begin sweeping it off the floor with your hands. There has to be a broom somewhere, a broom--!

&gt; resulted in █ casualties

What was that? The black box catches your attention and you abandon your sweeping efforts, instead pulling the file closer, ripping off a sticky note to read the section.

&gt; Dr. Bonjour was temporarily relieved from her position after incident ████-3, the escape of SCP-████. The ensuing chase and destruction resulted in █ casualties and ██ injuries. There was some suspicion that the escape was a premeditated plan between Dr. Bonjour and SCP-████ due to their recently revealed shared past, but no evidence beyond gossip and conjecture. Dr. Bonjour requested the relief before it could be issued, stating &#34;I don&#39;t

&#34;What did you find?&#34;

You snap the file shut and look up at the woman standing above you, a quizzical and vaguely disappointed look on her face. You scramble up, messing the papers in the file up, fighting a blush as you hand it to her. &#34;I--it was on your desk, I was, um, dropping off the, uh.&#34;

&#34;The 2118 papers, yes, thank you.&#34; She smoothly takes the file from you and puts it back on her desk, then goes to the tea table. &#34;Do you want to finish this? Looks like you hardly touched it.&#34;

&#34;Uh, I think I&#39;m just gonna...&#34; you trail off, backing towards the door. She sighs and pours some water into the teapot, swirling it around with practiced hands so it can be clean, shiny, new. You shouldn&#39;t ask. You have to ask. &#34;What happened?&#34;

She doesn&#39;t look at you as she says, &#34;I&#39;m still not certain. They told me I asked for amnestics.&#34;

You wait for her to elaborate, and when she doesn&#39;t, you slip away, into the hall, closing the door with a &#39;click&#39; behind you. [[/tab]] [[/tabview]]</textarea></pre>
