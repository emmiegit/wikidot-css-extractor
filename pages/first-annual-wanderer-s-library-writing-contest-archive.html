+ Theme: Building 

++ Holy Crap! Who Gave Troy Authority Over Here?

It was Mann. Blame him. He just wanted me to pretty shit up, and then, I went mad with power. Now? I&#39;m running a contest.

++ A contest? No way!

Yes. Way.

++ Are... Are you going to tell us what it is?

Oh. Right. Well, a while back, I spent about two weeks working near tirelessly on a world building document for the site. Namely, this baby: [[[thearchivistslog | Groups of Interest]]].

++ Troy. Jesus. What is the Contest?

It&#39;s quite simple. Go to the page. You will notice that there are several dead links. The contest is as follows:

* Choose a dead link.
* Click on it.
* Write a story that is somehow relevant to that link.
* Tag it with &#34;wlc2013&#34;

And congratulations. You&#39;ve officially entered the contest.  When four or five links are used, another administrator will edit the page and add additional links. Any of the three administrators of the site can and will do this.

Enter as many times as you want.

++ Wait. Troy. What is up with this?

Well, it&#39;s simple. Wikis are made for pages to reference each other, and currently, there are woefully few. Remember that people start reading sites like this—and keep reading for hours or days—based off of these connections. 

++ Wait. You thought this out, didn&#39;t you? Alright, fine. How do I //win//?

Well, that is pretty simple too. Let&#39;s take a look at my scientific method:

* You are awarded three points for every story you write. You can enter the contest as many times as you like. Entries which are deleted will not be counted in your total.
* You are awarded an additional number of points equal to the rating of your highest rated entry.
 
This means if you write three entries, and the highest one is rated +10, then your total will be +19.

At the end of the contest, each administrator will choose a single story to award three bonus points to. They will chose the story based on personal taste and preference.  This does NOT mean that your total will automatically increase by three points. Instead, that story&#39;s rating is counted as three points higher for the purposes of the contest. 

Consider it a gold star.

++ Anything else I need to know?

&gt; Do the stories have to be long?

Not necessarily, but short crap will get downvoted because of it. Look out. Your fellow users are more likely to police this than I am.

&gt; Can admins enter?

I can&#39;t. But yeah, Moose and Mann can. I&#39;m going to assume that they won&#39;t Gold Star themselves. Intellectual masturbation. Bleh.

&gt; What is the prize?! THE PRIZE, TROY?!?!

I&#39;ll come up with something. Relax.

&gt; When does the contest end?

The unused links will be removed on --March 8th at 11:59 PM--. **I LIED! CONTEST EXTENDED TO THE 14th! GO NUTS, KIDS!** The totals will be calculated at the same time, four days later, on the 18th.

&gt; Can I change the title? Or do I have to use the exact link? Do I need to keep the theme?

Try to use the source, in all cases. Feel free to deviate and expand at will, though.

&gt; Can I claim a page?

You can try! I&#39;ll let you hold one, but for a maximum of 24 hours at a time! I&#39;ll delete your hold 24 hours from the time of holding. You can try to hold it again... but it might... be... tricky. :)
