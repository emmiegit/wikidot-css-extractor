**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7847 is to be housed at Site-47. As the anomaly is of ongoing use to Foundation personnel, it is to be housed in a room secured with a standard keycard scanner. Monitors are to be installed to track all relevant outputs.

All uses of SCP-7847 are to be pre-approved by site supervisory staff, and staff entry/exit times are to be noted on the log sheet located within the room. No fewer than two other staff should be present at the time the anomaly is activated. Staff present within the room are to monitor for any signs of significant temporal disruption or increased energy output.

When using SCP-7847, staff are expected to equip themselves with necessary personal protective equipment (PPE). The PPE requirements should be outlined in their proposal for SCP-7847 usage and approved by site supervisory staff. Requests for equipment should be submitted by the approving body.

**Description:** SCP-7847 is a self-contained, lead-lined chamber measuring 4m x 4m x 6.5m.[[span  class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]##000000|**NOTE:** This chamber (and thus total area) can be divided into two smaller portions in cases where establishment of a decontamination area is necessary.##[[/span]] Developed by Foundation Department of Science researchers, the anomaly can be used to travel through space and time.[[span  class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]##000000|Colloquially, SCP-7847 is a time machine.##[[/span]]

Uses of SCP-7847 have thus far produced no notably abnormal results, including revisions to past or current realities. There are currently multiple theories as to why:
* **Usages of SCP-7847 are self-contained.** Thus, even significant alterations to the past do not alter the future.
* **Usages of SCP-7847 are self-correcting.** Influence is either externally corrected by an unknown force or corrected by undetected revisions (for example, an assassinated political figure being replaced with an exact clone).
* **Usages of SCP-7847 are undetectable.** If history is altered, any records of the resulting history would be as well. Thus, any significant changes that have taken place have altered history, time, and space, including life experiences and thus memories up to the moment of the usage for all involved.[[span  class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]##000000|**NOTE:** The possibility of this case has spurred implementation of an approval system, where all possible outcomes are duly considered and taken into account against the value of knowledge obtained.##[[/span]]

The anomaly was first successfully tested on 18 April 2035. Due to the volume of test logs generated since this date, all logs have been compiled in the ##4CB7ED|log database## created by Site-47 Supervisory Researcher Dr. Wells. --As of 1 November 2038, all tests have been for the sake of ventures into the past.-- Tests of SCP-7847 include ventures to both past and future times. However, those intended for information about the future have been suspended pending review by site supervisory staff. The log of the sole test of future-aimed travel is included below as Incident 7847.02.01 for general staff review.

+ INCIDENT 7847.02.01: &#34;THE WATCHER&#34;

[[/=]]

-----

++++ //FORWARD: A note from Dr. Wells of Site-47//

The following documents are put forth as both caution and explanation. I am including the personal accounts recovered from Agent Moore&#39;s cell phone alongside the usual log transcripts as I feel they provide valuable insight into her mental state.

While this test did not result in the death of a Foundation staff member, its events nonetheless constitute a loss. Additionally, we now know some of what the future holds for us. It would be difficult and incredibly costly to determine what points in humanity&#39;s future are &#34;safe&#34; for exploration. I am not sure we can justify that cost.

I must also express my condolences to those who knew Agent Moore -- those who knew her, trained alongside her, worked alongside her, loved her. May she find happiness when she now resides, and may we all find it in ourselves to carry on without her.

wellll im royally fucked. they announced who got selected for the test taking place on christmas: me. i have for some reason been designated as the Bitch Going To The Future.

i downed like all of the wine in my fridge when i got home and i&#39;ve been ignoring everyone&#39;s calls. woke up from my Wine Nap like twenty minutes ago and decided to be a productive adult and actually write shit down. so here that is, in my fucking notes app, because what else am i going to use? a journal? biiitch

checking in with myself i guess i&#39;m just... i don&#39;t know not scared yet. i will be. but i&#39;m so mad and sad and everything else that it&#39;s all blended together with my headache to just create this like constant emotional dial tone in my head. the other day i bitched about needing something new and god every fucking time an agent says that i swear some new Horrible Thing must happen to counteract it. combine that with the broadcasts i&#39;ve been seeing each night when i&#39;m trying to actually Chill. we&#39;re supposed to be the nightmarish side of things. now everything is. dead bodies and crying families and people screaming over and over and over

OK. here&#39;s the plan. i&#39;m gonna finish this and then plug my phone in and shower. and i&#39;m gonna drink water and reply to texts and try to sleep. and in the morning i&#39;m gonna go to work and i&#39;m gonna deal with this. nobody&#39;s wanted to go to the future and if they chose my ass to do it i&#39;m gonna be better than them and face it head-on.

Okay, I&#39;m in a better mindset to deal with this now.

To sort through things:
* I&#39;m angry I was chosen and I&#39;m missing a holiday.
* I&#39;m anxious about what I&#39;m going to encounter.
* Some part of me is admittedly excited at what I may find.
* I&#39;m confused about why I was chosen over other candidates.
* Which then makes me concerned about who and what I might encounter.

I&#39;ve caught up with everyone. A lot of the guys have been telling me they wish it was them. I&#39;m glad it was me, out of any of them -- the ones on MTFs have some seriously specialized skills, a lot of them have kids and families. I wanted all of that, too. Even checked to see if I could get some eggs frozen, just in case I do get blasted by some insane radiation levels, but appointments are months out. So that route&#39;s not happening.

God. I wish I could word this all more coherently, but typing it out is at least helping a little. I have to go in for an official briefing later today. Need to have all of this out of my brain before I have to address the people who pay me.

+++ MEETING SUMMARY 19 DECEMBER 2038

{{DATE AND START TIME:}} 19 December 2038 at 15:30.

{{STATED PURPOSE:}} To discuss Agent Emily Moore&#39;s upcoming assignment, a test of SCP-7847.

{{PARTIES PRESENT:}} Agent Moore, Dr. Louis Wells, Dr. Moyra Keller, Junior Researcher Joseph Steinhardt.

{{NOTES:}} Moore accepted assignment. Wells explained process and equipment to be utilized. Moore inquired as to selection criteria. Wells and Keller cited background in anthropology as primary reason for selection. Moore expressed concern about language barriers with possible encountered societies. Keller explained translation tools to be utilized, including software training requirements. Moore inquired as to radiation hazard risk. Wells confirmed equipment en route. Wells instructed Moore to remain in SCP-7847 if radiation levels were found to be inhospitable, as retrieval would occur after seven days. Moore inquired about hazard pay. Wells assured her hazard rate would be combined with her holiday rate to duly compensate her. Moore thanked the panel for their clarifications.

{{CERTIFIED BY:}} Junior Researcher Joseph Steinhardt. I attest all information included in this summary is accurate.

Well, they gave me a run-down of everything. I asked a bunch of questions and everyone was pretty responsive, so that&#39;s at least reassuring.

Off-the-record, I asked Wells if he thought this entire thing was just a death sentence. Not really my finest moment. But he said I had a fair shot. So that&#39;s what I&#39;ll stick with: a fair shot.

Still probably going to make some calls. This next week feels like it&#39;s going to be both the longest and shortest of my life.

Last night before takeoff. I meant to update this more, but getting everything prepared has eaten up basically all of my waking hours. The equipment&#39;s in, though, and we verified everything seems fine with 7847. So at least takeoff should be fine.

Mom called earlier to wish me a merry Christmas Eve. She&#39;s headed out with everyone else tomorrow to go to some light show. Nobody else has checked in, but between them being pissed at me for missing the holiday and... well, let&#39;s face it, I don&#39;t see them enough, it&#39;s another quiet holiday.

That&#39;s about it, I guess. Ordered a pizza as my sendoff gift to myself. The delivery person even drew a little reindeer on the box.

About to take some melatonin and then get to bed early. I have to be in at 7 tomorrow.

it&#39;s 4 in the morning and i can&#39;t fall back asleep but i&#39;m still tired. i just keep staring at the ceiling.

i remember doing stuff like this as a kid. i&#39;d get so excited during the holidays that i&#39;d get up at like 5. mom would always be up of course. she&#39;d make me cocoa and let me open one present, and then we&#39;d wait for everyone else to get downstairs.

with that i can&#39;t help but think about how empty my flat feels though. i&#39;m so isolated these days. i don&#39;t know what i was ever good for in this time, and now i have to face another one. it just feels so fucking hopeless. everything feels so hopeless.

god. i wonder when all the philosophers did most of their thinking. maybe it was 4 am too. they didn&#39;t have cocoa though.

Time to head over. I&#39;m leaving my phone at home since they advised against bringing personal electronic devices. Not checking any notifications, either, in case I get sucked into something and it throws me off kilter. Or makes me late.

+++ EVENT SUMMARY 25 DECEMBER 2038: TAKEOFF

{{OBJECTIVE:}} Transport Foundation Agent Moore to year 3050, location 39°00&#39;20.9&#34;N 116°00&#39;00.0&#34;W.[[span  class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]##000000|Geographical coordinates of Site-47 Research Wing B, which houses SCP-7847&#39;s containment chamber.##[[/span]]

{{NOTES:}} Agent Moore was provided with the following supplies:
* Video and audio recording equipment, along with backup power supplies.
* One (1) journal, for the purposes of recording observations.
* One (1) area map featuring projections of geographic change, as well as two (2) identical copies.
* Two (2) HAZMAT suits fitted with digital monitors, including a Geiger counter, damage sensors, and environmental anomaly sensors.
* One (1) standard-issue personnel travel kit, including toiletries, a thermal blanket, a personal shelter, a sleeping bag, and ten (10) days&#39; worth of rations.

A physical examination shortly before departure determined no cause for concern. A psychological examination determined that Moore harbored anxiety about the test; however, reviewing staff determined her to be fit to continue as planned.

{{TIMELINE:}}

* FINAL PROTOCOLS began at 10:15.
* ALL-CLEAR was given at 10:45.
* DEPARTURE COUNTDOWN began at 10:50.
* SIXTY-SECOND COUNTDOWN began at 10:59.
* TAKEOFF occurred at 11:00.

{{OUTCOME:}} Success.

**MOORE:** About to suit up and head out. Just wanted to record this first bit to make sure everything was all roses. I&#39;ll- I&#39;ll pause this real quick, save battery. I know they went overkill on the supply for this, but, you know. Force of habit.

//Footage and audio stop.//

//The recording is resumed. MOORE is now outfitted in a HAZMAT suit.//

**MOORE:** God, the monitors in this thing are fucking noisy. [laughs] Oh well. Stuff&#39;s working, at least. Now it&#39;s time to get out there, so you&#39;re getting mounted on my shoulder.

//After 17 seconds of adjustments, the camera appears to be properly in place.//

**MOORE:** Alright. 12:01. Let&#39;s roll.

//MOORE presses a sequence of keys. After a few seconds, the interior door opens, allowing her passage into the external chamber. The first set of doors closes, followed shortly by the second set opening to the exterior environment. MOORE&#39;s breath can be heard quickening as she steps outside, and the camera view quickly swings back towards SCP-7847 as the doors close behind her.//

**MOORE:** One big step for- god damn it.

//The camera pans around the area, quickly, then slowly back. Mountains rise in the distance, and the landscape is covered in densely-packed forest. The edge of the map can be seen as MOORE reviews it.//

**MOORE:** ...Huh.

//MOORE raises the map to the camera, tapping some of the topographical markings.//

**MOORE:** The landscape around here seems fine, but uh... this isn&#39;t desert anymore, apparently. And...

//A few sounds can be heard as MOORE navigates through readouts on the suit.//

**MOORE:** I&#39;m getting some levels of radiation detected. More than there usually is here, but not... not lethal. Which, honestly... this feels weirder. It&#39;s also pretty dark, but there&#39;s not a lot of canopy around here, so...
  
//The camera pans up to center on the Sun. Thick lines cross it, appearing to move slowly across its surface.//

//This view remains for several seconds before the camera is slightly disturbed and the recording ends.//

{{OBSERVATION SUMMARY:}}
* Possible climate changes. Landscape harbors flora not typically seen in region.
* Radiation levels above background, but do not appear to be lethal in immediate surroundings.
* Structure surrounding the Sun. Appears to be non-organic. Resulting decrease in light levels.

{{NOTES:}}

Possibility that future human societies constructed something around the Sun. Purpose is yet to be determined.

I need to look more into those radiation levels tomorrow. I&#39;m spending today going through what we have on 7847 -- data logs, all that jazz. See if I can reason through some of these changes.

I also didn&#39;t see anyone in the surrounding area, nor any lights or signs of shelter. I&#39;m checking around the old Site locations tomorrow. I don&#39;t know that anything would have survived this long, but it&#39;s at least a direction to walk in.

//The camera appears to be already mounted on MOORE&#39;s shoulder. The external set of doors can be seen opening.//

**MOORE:** Alright, you beeped, so you&#39;re on. I uh- [sigh] I did some research. I&#39;m still sticking with the original plan of poking around where the Site was, still... seems like the best route. But as for that //thing,// I&#39;ve got two potential possibilities. Luckily they&#39;re- they&#39;re mostly grounded.

//The camera view shifts back briefly towards SCP-7847 before turning back towards the environment.//

**MOORE:** Oh, it&#39;s... my watch says it&#39;s 7:31. I didn&#39;t get much sleep.

//The view swings up towards the sky, again centering on the Sun. It lingers here briefly.//

**MOORE:** That- [points] that&#39;s probably either, uh... a Dyson sphere of some sort -- it looks a little inefficient, honestly, compared to some of the designs that... nevermind. A Dyson sphere is one explanation. Another is that it&#39;s some sort of heat shielding. I&#39;d have to do proper analysis of the ozone around here, but considering how things were (are) in our time, I&#39;d buy that.

//The view shifts back down towards the tree line, turning as MOORE begins to move through the forest.//

**MOORE:** It could, of course, be some horrifying... machine thing of anomalous origins, but I&#39;d like to be optimistic. We can&#39;t just call everything an anomaly, even if it&#39;s, uh... [chuckles] orbiting around the Sun, darkening the Earth, all that fun stuff.

//A beam of light appears, hitting the foliage as MOORE&#39;s hand is seen clearing brush. She pauses to examine a thick, thorned vine.//

**MOORE:** Glad I kept the suit on. Anyway. Turning the camera off until I find anything of note or I start getting chased by something. Whichever comes first, I guess.

//Footage and audio stop.//

//The recording is resumed. MOORE is gesturing to a stark concrete wall.//

**MOORE:** It&#39;s uh... it&#39;s here. [laughs] I mean it makes sense, I just- wow. Let me figure out what building this is.

//MOORE begins to walk around the perimeter of the building. The camera pans to different features -- cracks in the exterior, worn graffiti, outcroppings with shattered windows. Eventually, she reaches the remnants of a vestibule. Broken glass surrounds the structure. Pausing at the threshold, she steps in cautiously. The camera view swings to an upper corner, where a small, black dome marks a security camera.//

**MOORE:** ...Cams seem to be down. Or at least the sensors for them do.

//MOORE vaults over a set of turnstiles, walking towards a set of large doors. Much of the paint has chipped away from the surface, but rough impressions of lettering can be seen.//

**MOORE:** ...And this is it. Shot to hell, so the nuke theory&#39;s not out, but I&#39;m not getting any higher readings here.

//MOORE presses the door handle, taking a deep breath before pushing the door open with audible effort. The beam of her flashlight can be seen sweeping across a lounge space. A series of screens on the far wall appear to be damaged, but all furniture is upright.//

**MOORE:** Doesn&#39;t seem to have hit as bad here. TVs seem out, though. Hopefully just a localized power outage.

//65 seconds pass without further dialogue as MOORE walks around what appears to have been Site-47&#39;s central lounge space. Notices to personnel can be seen scattered across the floor near message boards, many of the pages slightly yellowed but in otherwise legible condition. Each document found is quickly held up to the camera.//

//Shortly after MOORE appears to have completed a circuit of the lounge space, a clanking noise is heard. Based on the direction of camera view movement, it appears to come from the leftmost hallway.//

**MOORE:** ...Huh.

//MOORE pans around the room once more before decreasing the intensity of her flashlight beam and starting slowly down the hallway. The noise can be heard at increments of approximately 4 seconds, growing louder as she approaches.//

//MOORE crouches to the wall as she reaches the end of the hallway, taking a deep breath before slowly pushing open the door. A loud creaking noise can be heard, and MOORE swears as she slips through the door.//

//Faint light can be seen a distance down the hall. As she approaches its source -- a small doorway, likely that of one of the console rooms -- the sound stops. MOORE switches off her flashlight and backs herself against the wall.//

//MOORE remains in this position for several seconds before taking a deep breath and stepping around the corner. She is immediately confronted by a tall, pale, humanoid figure holding aloft what appears to be a makeshift candle.//

**FIGURE:** {{UNINTELLIGIBLE}}

**MOORE:** [gasp] Jesus, uh- you, you, do you- can you understand me?

**FIGURE:** [steps closer] {{UNINTELLIGIBLE}}

**MOORE:** You- //God-// you, just uh, keep talk- talking, I think it-

//The FIGURE continues to step closer, their voice growing louder. They produce a thin metal bar from behind their back and raise it above their head.//

**MOORE:** [backing up] No, no, hold on, I&#39;m not- fuck, //when// is this damn software supposed to kick on-

**FIGURE:** {{UNINTELLIGIBLE}}

//MOORE puts up her hands, backing up into the door. She quickly pushes it open and begins to run down the hallway. Shouting from the FIGURE can be heard behind her before the door closes. Most of the speech remains unintelligible, save for one word: {{TEMPLE.}}//

//Several seconds pass as MOORE makes her way out of the building and back through the foliage. She appears to place a hand on the camera to stabilize it, temporarily blacking out visual feed. View of the environment returns moments later, showing MOORE a few meters from SCP-7847. Footage stops once she has entered through the exterior doors.//

Found the old Site. Met the objective. So I&#39;ll call that a success.

I&#39;m honestly not sure whether to call this guy -- these guys? -- hostile. Upon reflection I would probably have a similar reaction if a strange figure approached me like that. I guess I __did,__ I just chose flight over fight.

I think I need to go back there today. Probably going to bring a weapon just in case. If I can stall long enough, though, translation might fully kick on. It seems like it did for a moment earlier, but it didn&#39;t quite make sense. If it does work, though, it&#39;s supposed to go both ways. That might help me avoid getting myself killed.

//Foliage brushes past the camera as MOORE navigates through the forest.//

**MOORE:** 13:14. Reviewed the instructions Keller left. Have my sidearm. [sighs] I have a plan, too, but it&#39;s a bit stupid. I think I&#39;m... I&#39;m at least going to pop off the top part of the suit. Whoever that was looked at least mostly human. Probably more inclined to deal with one of their own, right?

//MOORE pauses shortly, letting out a sharp laugh before resuming moving forward.//

**MOORE:** Reminds me of some of the old safety vids you had us watch, Wells. How everyone would run into danger and do the stupidest thing possible. And now here I am. Guess I didn&#39;t learn much.

//After several seconds, MOORE reaches the entryway of Site-47. She again clears the turnstiles, pushing her way through the doors and switching on her flashlight. Zipping and rustling is heard, and soon MOORE can be seen setting a gas mask down on one of the lounge tables.//

**MOORE:** Here we go.

//The clanking is audible once more as she proceeds down the same hallway, stopping short of the second set of doors. A gloved hand reaches up and knocks three times.//

Success. I also feel fine, but I did pop a few iodine tablets just in case. The inner chambers seem to be pretty shielded from the outside, though.

Software works, too. Well, kind of. I&#39;ve been sitting here trying to figure out what those cryptic words actually meant, though. My best guess is this is their version of tracking solar cycles, since they mentioned darkening -- but then, am I supposed to come at night or in the morning?

**FIGURE A:** {{Zunn, the Stranger is here.}}

//The FIGURE -- now to be referred to as ZUNN -- steps back to allow passage. MOORE enters last. The group is then led towards the fork in pathways until they reach one of Site-47&#39;s former console rooms. A large amount of candles cover the panels and cabinets inside.//

**MOORE:** Emergency lights are out too, then. {{Thank you.}}

**ZUNN:** {{You are welcome.}}

//ZUNN points to FIGURES A, B, and C respectively.//

**ZUNN:** {{Loht, Fonn, Eaj. Do you have title?}}

**MOORE:** Emily.

//There is a moment of silence as ZUNN looks at MOORE.//

**ZUNN:** {{You are Fajn. Now we have met.}}

//ZUNN gestures to a set of conference tables in the back of the room. Scattered across their surface are several notebooks and binders. MOORE approaches a large binder, the title of which reads UNFEJDYN.[[span  class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]##000000|When pronounced by Moore, this phrase was translated as &#34;DEVELOPMENTS.&#34;##[[/span]]//

**MOORE:** {{May I?}}

//ZUNN smiles, revealing sharp teeth.//

**ZUNN:** {{Yes.}}

//ZUNN nods to the others, who proceed into the next room.//

//Footage and audio begin to stop and resume intermittently, MOORE showing passages from various materials. The majority appear to be clippings of R&amp;D and technology reports -- largely diagrams -- from a mix of Foundation and external sourcing.//

//After several such clips, continuous footage resumes. MOORE taps an image on a page of the binder, depicting a circular structure with several rings orbiting it. She then shuts the binder and sets it aside.//

**ZUNN:** {{What are your thoughts?}}

**MOORE:** {{Do you know what those items are?}}

**ZUNN:** {{Tools of the holy.}}

**MOORE:** {{Could you make that understood?}}

* Each life form has similar characteristics:
 * Pale skin
 * Light hair
 * Thick, claw-like fingertips
* Visually, their language appears similar to English or Dutch.

{{NOTES:}}

Going by what Zunn said, it seems like we&#39;re basically mythological figures in their time. I guess it makes sense -- we&#39;ve already left so much of ourselves everywhere, technology-wise, that it would make sense for a future, isolated group to find our artifacts and try their best to explain them. It&#39;s what human societies have done since the beginning of time.

I did also find a diagram of a Dyson sphere in that binder. It&#39;s visually pretty damn close to what&#39;s circling the Sun, so I guess that makes Theory 1 the winner. Based on my timing today, I&#39;m guessing my theory about the Watcher/eye deal was also correct. Everyone needs a Helios.

I wonder what they think of me in all of my getup.

I couldn&#39;t sleep, and sitting inside 7847 was driving me insane. I just kept replaying my last few moments with Zunn.

So I went for a walk. There&#39;s a little hill not too far from the site, and I climbed up there and just sat back and watched the sunset. And it was beautiful -- if a bit muted -- but what made me run back and grab my notebook for this observation was the stars. __Is__ the stars.

You can see the Milky Way. I don&#39;t mean catch a glimpse of it. I&#39;ve never seen so many stars in my life. And there were mourning doves singing. There were crickets. There were frogs. There&#39;s probably a coyote nearby. I don&#39;t care.

Because God, I __get__ it. After years of growing dread every time I opened the news, every time I got a text, every time I got called into an office, I get it.

I&#39;ve spent so long seeing people try to confront the worst. The idea that the end is the end. That there&#39;s nothing after. But there is. There&#39;s so much here.

And I&#39;m realizing I can&#39;t go back. Not without learning. Not without knowing. Maybe I can bring back some of what we lost. Figure out some of what went wrong. It&#39;s __us,__ after all. Maybe we can fix some of our mistakes preemptively.

Maybe there&#39;s hope for us. Regardless, there&#39;s hope for our future.
