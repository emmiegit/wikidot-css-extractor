+++ 1. Background

On 8/20/2021, a UIU agent discovered a post on Parawatch.net in which user &#34;Red Derring&#34; reported that extreme anomalous activity was taking place in the town of Kidney, New York. The post was accompanied by several pieces of photographic and video evidence upon initial creation, but the media was rendered inoperable by an unknown technical glitch. The majority of commenters on the post expressed skepticism of its veracity.

+++ 2. Current Status

No prior reports of unusual incidents in Kidney are on the record. However, the post also claimed that most residents of the town seemed completely unaware of the phenomena and unable to perceive them. It is possible that the reported anomaly, if real, possesses self-concealing properties that affect most residents of the town and the other users of Parawatch, but not the UIU agents who viewed the post.

+++ 3. Leads

&#34;Red Derring&#34; may still possess copies of the media originally attached to his post. Agents posing as Parawatch users will attempt to obtain them.

The ground is bleeding.

It started in June. At first, there were just a few muddy spots in people&#39;s yards. You couldn&#39;t really tell that it was blood, not at first. But after about week, there was more of it. Enough to splash around in, to stain your shoes if you walked through it. And when I say blood, I mean //blood//. Not water that&#39;d been dyed red, not red clay, //blood//. Thick, dark red, metallic smelling blood. It never scabs or anything, but it&#39;s definitely blood.

Obviously, this freaked me the fuck out, just random puddles of blood welling up all over the place. But that&#39;s not even the weirdest part. The weirdest part is that nobody else can see it. Or if they can, they&#39;re not seeing it...right? People still walk around the puddles and stuff but they can&#39;t tell that it&#39;s blood. I saw the kid across the street splashing around in it, getting all covered in blood, and acting like it was just water. I tried to talk to people about it but it was like most of them couldn&#39;t even hear me, and the ones that could just looked at me like I was nuts. Hell, maybe I was. It didn&#39;t seem to be hurting anybody.

I thought about calling people, but who do you even call for something like that? &#34;Hey 911, the ground is bleeding but I&#39;m the only one who can see it.&#34; They&#39;d have thought I was a prank caller and charged me with a misdemeanor or something. Like I said, I thought I was going nuts. Then the monsters started showing up.

I was taking out the trash at the end of my shift when I saw it. I went out the back door, trash bag in hand, and there was this...lizard man thing. It wasn&#39;t very big, maybe three or four feet tall, and shaped like a person but with kind of weird proportions, like an ape, and these nasty yellow-green scales all over it. It had knocked over one of the trash cans and was rooting through it, I guess for something to eat. It looked up at me and its head was kind of like an iguana but it had //human eyes//. I was so freaked out that I dropped the trash bag and I guess the noise startled it. By the time I got my phone out it had already run off down the alley. I chased after it, of course, but it was gone by the time I made it to street.

Yeah, I know. Sounds crazy, doesn&#39;t it? Pretty standard misidentified animal cryptid sighting. A mangy raccoon, or an escaped pet lizard or something. But here&#39;s the thing: that was just the first one. I wasn&#39;t able to get close to any of the other ones, but once I started digging I was able to find some pictures and videos (don&#39;t ask me how; it wasn&#39;t always 100% legal). I&#39;ve attached them to the end of this post.

At first I hoped that maybe people would be able to see this stuff, unlike the blood, but nobody reacted weird when I showed them the pictures. Then that fucking news broadcast aired on //live TV// and I knew there was no way. If anybody in town could see this shit other than me, that would&#39;ve proved it to them. I //had// to be insane by that point. Almost checked myself into the psych ward.

Then little Marty Swanson died.

I say &#34;died&#34;. Officially, he&#39;s just missing. But that&#39;s because nobody else can fucking see the blood. I walked over to his house, after he turned up missing, and I could see the drag marks. He was playing in his front yard when he &#34;disappeared,&#34; that&#39;s what his mom said. But he didn&#39;t fucking disappear. Something crawled out of the storm drain across the street and grabbed him. He must&#39;ve noticed it after he touched him; it looked like he&#39;d ripped up chunks of the yard trying to crawl away, and there were bloody handprints all the way back across the street. Tire tracks, too. Doesn&#39;t look like anybody slowed down or even swerved.

I wish I had fucking been there. Maybe if I&#39;d heard him screaming I could&#39;ve helped him. But I didn&#39;t even see it.

I think something here is controlling people&#39;s minds or warping their perceptions or something. The blood, the monsters, the perception stuff, it&#39;s all coming from the same thing. It has to be. 

That&#39;s why I&#39;m posting here. I know, or at least hope, that you guys will believe me. Maybe you&#39;re outside the range of this thing, maybe it can&#39;t get to your minds and cover stuff up like it has everybody else I&#39;ve talked to and showed the pictures to. You&#39;ve got to call the FBI or the EPA or somebody before anybody else dies. Tell them there&#39;s something happening in Kidney, New York. Tell them whatever you have to, the truth or a terrorist attack or whatever, anything to get them to show up. I already tried that but it was the same thing, they all either laughed me off or couldn&#39;t even hear me. Maybe you&#39;ll have better luck.

Or maybe you won&#39;t see it either, and I really am crazy.

&gt; Well, at least //somebody// believes me. I hope the guys were just affected by the same whatever-it-is, and not actually being dicks. I don&#39;t guess I can blame them, though, what with the images being borked. Nothing&#39;s worked right since we moved from Wikidot to this &#34;Simple Coding Platform&#34; shit. Hopefully the attachments will work on this message at least.
&gt; 
&gt; I wanted to attach the pictures too, but the Facebook page is private now and I can&#39;t find the fucking newspaper anymore either. More proof that I&#39;m crazy, I guess. Not that I can prove it, but the Facebook photo was from some lady named Lisa Jackson, of her husband and their kids sitting on the couch. She was asking for prayer because they all had a &#34;stomach bug,&#34; but in the picture their hair was falling out and I think the dad had radiation burns on his face. I don&#39;t know where she lives and I can&#39;t find her in the phone book but I&#39;m sure you can figure it out. The other picture is from a newspaper that came out about a month ago; one of the last couple pages had a story about the summer reading program and you could see some kind of giant red bat in the background of the picture they used. I&#39;m sure you can find some more copies of it somewhere, but I sure can&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; P.S. - Don&#39;t name yourself after the X-Files, genius. Everybody knows you&#39;re a fed. I&#39;m only even talking to you because this is a matter of life and death. You guys better fix this.

&gt; **0:00:** A reporter from the local news station stands in downtown Kidney, reporting on the upcoming school board elections.
&gt; 
&gt; **0:16:** A loud, sustained noise similar to the &#34;screaming&#34; of a mountain lion is heard. Neither the reporter nor any visible pedestrians react to the sound. The sound continues, drowning out the reporter&#39;s speech.
&gt; 
&gt; **0:25:** Thick clouds of steam begin issuing from a nearby manhole cover.
&gt; 
&gt; **0:32:** A pedestrian walks directly through the steam cloud. He stops, looks around, shakes his head, and continues walking.
&gt; 
&gt; **0:40:** Segment ends.

&gt; **0:00:** A pickup truck is driving through Kidney&#39;s forested outskirts at night.
&gt; 
&gt; **1:24:** The headlights reveal a large hairless animal covered in sharp metallic spines of varying shape, length, and placement. The driver slams on his brakes.
&gt; 
&gt; **1:25:** The truck skids to a halt and collides with the animal, which makes a loud, metallic vocalization and collapses. The truck&#39;s hood springs open in a burst of smoke and steam. Various alarms sound.
&gt; 
&gt; **1:28:** The driver swears and jumps out of his vehicle to inspect the damage. He stands motionless and stares down at the animal, which is whimpering softly.
&gt; 
&gt; **3:02:** The animal falls silent. The man, unmoving, continues to stare.
&gt;  
&gt; **6:31:** A loud banging noise issues from the truck&#39;s crushed engine. The man is startled by the noise. He inspects the engine, swears repeatedly, and climbs back into the vehicle. He makes a mobile phone call.
&gt; 
&gt; **6:40:** Man: //Hey. Yeah, uh, I just hit a bear. No, I&#39;m okay. Truck&#39;s wrecked, though. Uh, Slaughter Road. Near the water tower. Thanks.//

&gt; **0:00:** A family (mother, father, two sons, dog) are in the backyard of their home. The mother is holding the camera, filming her sons as they swordfight with sticks. Their father is cooking food on a grill, beside which the dog (a basset hound) waits expectantly. The back portion of the yard is flooded by a large puddle of red liquid. The family does not seem to notice.
&gt; 
&gt; **0:18:** A large bubble forms in the puddle. It slowly expands.
&gt; 
&gt; **0:23:** One of the boys finds a caterpillar. He picks it up and brings it to his mother, who zooms the camera in on the insect. It resembles a tomato hornworm, but its markings are distorted and its skin is a fleshy pink.
&gt; 
&gt; **0:38:** The mother points her camera at the other son, who is doing an impromptu dance. The bubble is still visible in the background.
&gt; 
&gt; **0:59:** The bubble is now almost half a meter in diameter. A dark, indistinct shape is visible through the translucent membrane.
&gt; 
&gt; **1:08:** The father begins telling a story, and his wife points the camera at him. The blood bubble is no longer in the shot.
&gt; 
&gt; **1:15:** A loud, wet popping sound is heard. The family does not react, but the dog is startled by the noise. It looks off-camera, towards the puddle.
&gt; 
&gt; **1:24:** The father offers the dog a piece of meat, which it ignores. He drops it on the ground.
&gt; 
&gt; **1:32:** An unseen baby cries. The family does not react, but the dog curiously approaches the puddle.
&gt; 
&gt; **1:34:** Off-camera, the dog growls.
&gt; 
&gt; **1:35:** The dog yelps loudly. Growling stops.
&gt; 
&gt; **1:36:** The crying stops.
&gt; 
&gt; **1:37:** The father announces that the burgers are done.
&gt; 
&gt; **1:38:** A baby laughs.
&gt; 
&gt; **1:39:** Video ends.

In the storm drain below Main Street - the location of &#34;news_screaming.mp4&#34; - agents found a large pile of broken igneous rocks.

Scrape marks on the ground nearby suggest that an unknown party attempted to relocate the object before electing to destroy it instead.

++ The Home of Lisa Jackson

----
Property records indicate that a Lisa Jackson lived in downtown Kidney, at 245 Canada Drive. The residence there seemed to have been recently abandoned. Most valuables and keepsakes had been removed, but fresh food remained in the refrigerator. None of Ms. Jackson&#39;s neighbors could recall any unusual departures or professed any knowledge of her whereabouts. The middle school attended by her children reported that they had both been absent for the last three days, and her husband&#39;s workplace reported a similar absence.

Geiger counters read dangerous levels of radiation throughout the house. Radiation was most concentrated in the basement, which had been flooded with over 1 foot of blood. Further investigation of the basement was put on hold until proper handling equipment could be procured, and the Jackson home placed under a fumigation tent to limit potential spread of radioactive material.

None of Jackson&#39;s friends or neighbors have inquired about or expressed interest in the fumigation tent or the presence of agents in protective gear.

You fuckers might kill me but you won&#39;t kill the truth.

+++ 1. Background

While searching Kidney for evidence, agents determined the approximate boundaries of the roughly circular area in which the blood was appearing.

At the exact center of this area was Kidney Elementary School.

On the morning of Saturday, September 4th, Agents David Brown and Michelle Collins entered the school to safely evacuate the few administrators and custodians present, cordon off the surrounding area, and identify possible sources of the anomalous phenomena. The school grounds were significantly contaminated with blood, which was welling up from several points on the playground, parking lot, and neighboring sports fields. The interior of the building was riddled with bloody hand- and fingerprints left by students returning from recess. Agents reported that the smell of blood, though present throughout Kidney, was almost overpowering inside the school. The odor was strongest in the basement, which was flooded with several inches of the substance. While attempting to explore the basement, Brown and Collins were attacked by an unknown invisible entity. Brown was killed, but Collins managed to escape with moderate injuries and call for backup. The entity did not pursue her from the basement.

+++ 2. Objectives

In response to the escalating paranormal threat and evidence of third-party interference, a Mobile Occult Operations Team (MOOT) unit was dispatched to Kidney Elementary School to neutralize the hostile entity in the basement and, if possible, identify and/or neutralize the source of the anomalous phenomena. Given the still-unknown nature of the threat, MOOT was outfitted with countermeasures to threats both paranormal and mundane, including thaumaturgically-enhanced armor and weaponry, anti-invisibility measures, and protections from biohazards and psychic influence. They were also equipped with weapon-mounted flashlights and infrared goggles to counteract the basement&#39;s nonfunctional lighting and, potentially, the hostile entity&#39;s invisibility.

++ Operational Report

----

&gt; **0800:** Operation commences. MOOT enters the school basement.
&gt; 
&gt; **0801:** MOOT discovers Agent Brown&#39;s remains. His skull has been crushed by a forceful impact.
&gt; 
&gt; **0802-0816:** MOOT searches multiple storage rooms, finding an assortment of disused landscaping and maintenance tools, unused desks, bookshelves, and other furniture, and blood-soaked cardboard boxes.
&gt; 
&gt; **0817:** While walking down a hallway, team lead Gonzales is struck in the chest by the invisible entity. He is launched several feet backwards and knocked down, but his warded armor prevents serious injuries. Infrared goggles are not able to see the entity. Thaumaturgist Eaton uses a chemical sprayer to douse the hostile in Powder of Ibn Ghazi, temporarily neutralizing its invisibility and revealing it as a metallic humanoid automaton. Agent Barton fires at it ineffectually. The automaton lunges forward and backhands Barton, knocking the gun from his grasp and slamming him against the wall.
&gt; 
&gt; **0818:** Eaton tries to flee, but the automaton grabs his arm and flings him to the ground. With its other hand, the automaton grabs the stunned Barton by his neck and crushes it.
&gt; 
&gt; **0819:** The automaton advances on Gonzalez, who is struggling to his feet. It kicks him in the side, then grabs him by the collar of his armor and lifts him up. The automaton draws back its other hand for a punch.
&gt; 
&gt; **0820:** Eaton evokes a bolt of electricity, which strikes the automaton. Its fingers spasm, releasing Gonzalez, who scrambles away. The automaton falls to its knees, then face-first into the blood. Something within it explodes, leaving a smoking hole in its back. The destroyed automaton slowly dissolves into the blood.
&gt; 
&gt; **0821:** Eaton and Gonzalez regroup. After confirming that they each have only minor injuries, and that both the hostile and Barton have been terminated, they continue the mission.
&gt; 
&gt; **0832:** MOOT enters a large, empty room. The floor tiles at its center have bucked and broken, creating a crack from which blood slowly oozes.
&gt; 
&gt; **0835:** Gonzalez attempts to pry the tiles apart, with limited success. He orders Eaton to retrieve shovels from one of the storage rooms passed earlier.
&gt; 
&gt; **0840:** Eaton returns with two shovels, which he and Gonzalez use to pry up the damaged floor tiles. Beneath them is a morass of red mud. A broken piece of concrete protrudes from the muck. 
&gt; 
&gt; **0842:** MOOT uses the shovels to partially unearth the chunk of concrete. Something shiny becomes visible and Gonzalez squats down to inspect it.
&gt; 
&gt; **0845:** Gonzales wipes away some of the mud and blood with his glove. The shiny object is revealed as a brass plaque, which reads &#34;SCP Foundation Department of Abnormalities&#34;.

+++ 1. Findings

It is now believed that all anomalous phenomena in Kidney stemmed from a breached containment facility buried under the elementary school. This facility was presumably abandoned well before the school&#39;s construction, and possibly before the establishment of Kidney itself.

Less than an hour after the operation&#39;s conclusion, a sizeable convoy of SCP Foundation vehicles arrived at Kidney Elementary School. Several dozen agents of an unknown Mobile Task Force entered the building and demanded that the UIU vacate the premises. MOOT team lead Gonzalez nearly provoked a violent confrontation when he accused the Foundation agents of complicity in Kidney&#39;s situation, but Agent Collins convinced him to stand down and exit the building. The Foundation proceeded to set up a temporary containment zone around the elementary school.

Foundation representatives claim that they were alerted to the situation in Kidney when their webcrawlers discovered Red Derring&#39;s Parawatch posts.

+++ 2. Bureau Actions

In partnership with the SCP Foundation and Environmental Protection Agency, Kidney is being evacuated under the pretense of a leaking, previously unknown chemical waste dump. Kidney&#39;s citizens have readily accepted this cover story. No indisputable evidence of direct mental manipulation was found; the symptoms of Kidney&#39;s citizens most resemble [[[saphir-centre |Filbuson Syndrome]]], though such prevalence and uniformity in a population of this size is highly unusual. Amnestics administered by the SCP Foundation as part of standard cover-up procedures have substantially alleviated signs of psychological distress in affected individuals.

Kidney has been designated a Superfund site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and its citizens will be compensated accordingly. Under CERCLA, the SCP Foundation is financially responsible for said compensation. While the Foundation has denied any culpability for these events, it agreed to these terms to avoid a protracted legal battle.

Cleanup operations will be managed primarily by the SCP Foundation, under the supervision of the Unusual Incidents Unit and the Environmental Protection Agency. Currently, cleanup consists of pumping the blood from water table and shipping it to SCP Foundation [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-43 |Site-43]]] for acroamatic abatement. These measures have already reduced the amount of blood welling to the surface considerably. No additional anomalous entities have been encountered since the beginning of this process.

Despite ongoing jurisdictional disputes, the SCP Foundation has refused to relinquish control of the elementary school or disclose any information about the containment site below. The Unusual Incidents Unit is currently lobbying for Kidney to be classified as a Nexus, which would grant the UIU greater jurisdiction over the area.

+++ 3. Final Analysis

The SCP Foundation has officially denied any knowledge of or involvement with the facility below the school, instead calling it a false flag operation by the &#34;Chaos Insurgency&#34;. The Foundation has likewise denied responsibility for the cover-up operation that was apparently taking place, or any involvement with the disappearance of the Jackson family or Red Derring.

Given the evidence, these claims are believed to be false. Reports of the SCP Foundation&#39;s involvement in [[[scp-6500 |other recent disasters]]] are being reevaluated accordingly.
