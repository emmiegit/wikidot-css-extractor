Creature Features!

[[div class=&#34;wilson-body&#34;]]
Potatoes is our handsome stallion we rescued from an abandoned home here in Boring. Potatoes obviously was too much for his previous owners. Evidently, so much so that they left in a hurry (even without some of their belongings)! Potatoes doesn’t have any behavioral issues which was very fortunate for our Rescue Team (and even more fortunate for our terrestrial team)! He still, however, caused a ruckus while running around pre-capture. So you might be wondering: what’s so special about our sweet Potatoes? He generates a growing amount of potential energy when he runs, in the form of electricity. Now that might be interesting, but what’s even more special is that when he stops, he exerts it all, this beautiful lad is absolutely explosive!

@@ @@
Fun fact about our Potatoes: he absolutely loves prancing. This fantastic colt will put on a great show for caretakers by hopping around and practically bursting with electricity! He was almost definitely a show horse, and is an even better race horse, reaching speeds up to 120 MPH; now that’s a lot of horsepower!
@@ @@
You might have realized his profile says his name is &#34;Potoooooooo,&#34; this is a formatting error, but we kept it as it gives him that much more character! This silly little colt doesn’t seem to mind either, as he responds both to &#34;Potatoes&#34; and &#34;Pot-oo.&#34;

Now, we might have already mentioned we found him in an abandoned home, however, we don’t actually have that much information on his history. He did, however, give our Rescue Team quite the shock! While trying to wrangle Potatoes he was already prancing, so when they finally got him to stop, he ended up shocking the majority of them. He clearly expresses his regret by licking those involved, (they definitely forgive him)! Quite the electrifying experience!
@@ @@
Potatoes enjoys prancing with fellow colts, however this is considered dangerous. While it&#39;s allowed under supervision (to keep him as happy and healthy as possible)! He does also show a huge liking to our own Jim Harris. Jim is the one who feeds him and watches over him every day.

Special Needs and Accommodations!
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;wilson-body&#34;]]
Potatoes enjoys the presence of other animals; however, his abilities render him a danger to them if he begins his prancing. Sadly, this means he isn’t permitted to have visitations with other colts often. Even though visitation is limited this, however, hasn’t had much effect on his silly personality! Something to note is the fact he doesn’t like doctors’ visits. He has attempted multiple times to activate his ability during doctors’ visits mean that poor Potatoes must be unconscious beforehand. Even though doctors visits are a hassle, it definitely hasn’t stopped him from being a healthy and handsome horse!

Hey, Tim!

This is regarding Potatoes, while inspecting items we recovered during the rescue of our friend, we found a phone in a brown backpack. We’d like permission to continue to inspect this, so I’m emailing you over this issue. This may give us some history on our pal!

Thanks!

Good work with Potatoes, he’s obviously acclimated well, and seems very well-mannered.
Regarding your previous email, you have my full permission and consent to look through the phone; however, please check with the police first as I want to make sure this is lawful. Maybe we can get some information on Potatoes, keep me updated!

First off thanks for the quick response, while the police were inspecting through the phone, they informed me it was empty save for a few texts. They had a look through it and gave me the go ahead to keep the texts as no one reclaimed it in the past week, and no contact was found. This one strange text conversation was interesting enough to warrant filing, which I’m now sending to you... Something to note was the phone was shortcircuited but we transferred the stored data to another phone. Keeping you updated is probably best. I made sure to attach it. Right side is the sender.

The messages stored on the phone ended there, it was weird enough for me to warrant sending this to you, as I know they were talking about our pal Potatoes. We weren&#39;t able to find the sender, however the house post-op was determined to be a rental house and sustained major circuitry damage.
