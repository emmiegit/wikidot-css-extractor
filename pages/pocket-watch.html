i see you in there
with your fireplace and your
wooden dining room 
table with nice plates and
silverware and candles
that can sit eight people
(six on the sides, one
on each end) and
your happy family
get-together where
grandpa tells the kids
that story about how
when he was a young
man his dad gave him
the nicest pocket watch
he had ever seen and
told him that it was
a magic family heirloom
to be kept with him
always and now that
pocket watch is with
your father and some
day it will be with you
and i&#39;m stuck out here
and it&#39;s so
cold
and you won&#39;t
let me in.

when the moon shines
down on the town
and the stars are
bright like the eyes
of naive little children
who think that the show
can go on forever if they only
will it so,
i yearn for walls
that keep out the snow
but allow me to pass
through to the place
where you wait for me
to say honey i&#39;m home, 
instead of striking me down
with great bolts of lightning.
i yearn for the home

wow, you did well

was always so sweet,

known and done something,

when his face flashes
behind walls of christmas cheer and

i want to lay down

i had a dream the other night
that you were a little older, a 
little less bright-eyed about
dress shoes and the things
they talk about on the tv, 
and your grandpa was
suddenly very ill, and you went
to see him in the hospital, and
your parents were too busy with
work to go see him, and your
siblings didn&#39;t care enough to
cancel their plans, and the 
nurses weren&#39;t there to check
up on him, so it was just you
and him as he lay there dying,
and you were absentmindedly 
fiddling with the old pocket
watch he gave you, and he
noticed, and he turned to
you and said to tell you the
truth, i made up that whole
story about the watch, i just
bought it at a store somewhere
downtown to make your dad
feel special, and then he went
quiet, and then he flatlined, 
and then i woke up, and after
that dream i had a soft smile
on my face the whole snowy morning,
and the clerk at the store
asked me why was i smiling
as i paid for a new mattress 
and set of blankets, and i
said oh no reason, why was i
