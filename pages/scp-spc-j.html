**Item #:** SCP-SPC

**Outrage Class:** Appleyawn[[footnote]] My darling niece Emma came up with this outrage class! It means &#34;So horrible that there&#39;s no hope. At all. Ever.&#34; Which I think is a pretty good descriptor, considering. Isn&#39;t Emma just the smartest? So talented, unlike soME //PEO**PLE**//[[/footnote]]

**Steps for Crisis Prevention:** I am literally shaking right now. I cannot stress this enough: moving forward, if anything nice[[footnote]] Heretofore to be understood as: AN! Y! THING! //NICE!!// [[/footnote]] -- happens to the soulless monsters who run SCP-SPC, I&#39;m going to have a stroke. I mean it. I&#39;ll have a stroke, I&#39;ll die, that&#39;s it. Boom. Nervous breakdown, stroke, dead. So unless you actively want me to be //murdered// by how horrible it is, you need to do something about SCP-SPC //right now.// 

Yeah, well, you know what ELSE is manipulative, Linda?! //This apparent fixation you have with me getting a stroke!// Maybe I should just put it on blast, huh? Ahem: **LINDA MASTERSON GETS A BIZARRE SEXUAL RUSH FROM SEEING HER NEIGHBORS NOT GET ANY OXYGEN IN THEIR BRAIN BECAUSE OF HOW MISERABLE THEY ARE!** Oh, no, don&#39;t give me that look, it&#39;s //clearly// something you take pride in.

...anyway, if you see something SCP-SPC-related somewhere out on the street or something, just take it to the nearest Society for Concerned Parents outpost and... put it in a... //box??// I guess?? Whatever, I&#39;m //done.//

**Description:** SCP-SPC is //supposedly// this organization called the &#34;Shark Punching Center&#34; that I heard about the other day. Anyone with one-and-a-half brain cells to rub together can make out its true intentions. But, since a certain Mrs. Masterson is with us, I see that we&#39;ll have to make a more thorough guide for the easily-deceived: 

&#34;Shark&#34; = &#34;Baby Shark&#34;[[footnote]] //,,doot-doo doo-doo-doo,,// [[/footnote]] song = things children like = **Children.**

&#34;Punching&#34; = that Japanimation or whatever cartoon my horrid little nephew Craighden likes = scantily-clad cartoon women = //S-E-X// = **Human Trafficking.**

&#34;Center&#34; = highest central authority = government secrets = vaccines = Bill Gates = Tom Hanks = **Deep State.**

If you&#39;re reading this, and you haven&#39;t dropped whatever you&#39;re doing to fight the Deep State &#34;Shark Punchers&#34;, then you&#39;re a sick individual and --I&#39;m already in the process of having you committed. And don&#39;t think I won&#39;t do it, either! //I&#39;m one signature away from becoming the legal guardian of half of you complete bastards!//-- [[footnote]] **Edit:** As chairwoman of the Edgebrook HOA, I am legally obligated to clarify the previous statement with the following: //ohmy go sh I dont know what i was dooign?? what caem ov err mee when iiiif ashdghdsg WWROTE THIIS?ss??? I wafhas I&#39;m sorr eeee plaeess dont4 hATE MEEAAGHHGHH SHUDDUPLINDA// [[/footnote]] I want nothing to do with you.

Here, I have [http://www.scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/shark-punching-center#pages a list] of the harm SCP-SPC has caused - in plain sight, no less - from my gardener who says he&#39;s on a first-name basis with Q. Bear in mind the coded language - if you went to my seminar, you&#39;ll know. I&#39;m not going over it again just for you.

Especially noteworthy is [[[SPC-169-J]]] - they ADMIT that they&#39;re attempting to seduce a 4,000-kilometer-long sea monster baby. Not even the laws of physics will stop these hopelessly sick-minded individuals from getting their perverted gratification.

&gt; **INTERVENTION LOG**

&gt; 
&gt; &lt;Begin log&gt;
&gt; .
&gt; **Maureen W.:** You sure this is the place?
&gt; 
&gt; **Kevin M.:** Of course I am.
&gt; 
&gt; **Hilda N.:** Because if the victim&#39;s not under us right now I&#39;m gonna be so. Fucking. //Angry.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Maureen W.:** Hilda! Language!
&gt; 
&gt; **Hilda N.:** (single shriek that lasts 34 seconds, followed by incoherent sobbing)
&gt; 
&gt; **Maureen W.:** Good point. I apologize.
&gt; 
&gt; (Low, rumbling sound from under the waves)
&gt; 
&gt; **Kevin M.:** Goddamn it, Linda, you wanna argue //now?!// Of all times?
&gt; 
&gt; **Maureen W.:** Pretty sure we threw Linda overboard at--
&gt; 
&gt; **Kevin M.:** Sure, by all means, correct the //shit// out of me.
&gt; 
&gt; (Low, rumbling sound, again)
&gt; 
&gt; **Kevin M.:** LINDA I SWEAR TO--
&gt; 
&gt; **Hilda N.:** It&#39;s the victim!
&gt; 
&gt; **Maureen W.:** Okay, all right, this is happening, uh... //places,// people!
&gt; 
&gt; (Maureen continues through a megaphone)
&gt; 
&gt; **Maureen W.:** Hey, SPC-169-J? Can you hear me, Kayleigh? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hilda N.:** That&#39;s not her name.
&gt; 
&gt; **Maureen W.:** Kayleigh, I&#39;m //so sorry// that people are lying about your name.
&gt; 
&gt; **Kevin M.:** Focus, Reen.
&gt; 
&gt; **Hilda N:** It&#39;s Skye. We agreed to call her Skye.
&gt; 
&gt; **Maureen W.:** Kayleigh, baby, listen: we&#39;re here to protect you from Bill Gates. You may not know who he is, but he&#39;s a very mean deep state person here to &#34;punch&#34; you, which means not actually punch you. But we&#39;re not gonna let him hurt you. Hilda, give her the medicine!
&gt; 
&gt; **Hilda N.:** Here you go, Skye.
&gt; 
&gt; (Hilda drops the holistic protection capsule into the ocean. Ten seconds later, a two-meter-long wooden rod is thrown onto the boat from the water level by a mysterious force.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Kevin M.:** Stick! Call the police!
&gt; 
&gt; (Maureen picks up the rod, reading an inscription on the side: &#34;holi stick of awaken see monster by dado - hit a thing to use yes&#34;)
&gt; 
&gt; **Hilda N:** PUT IT DOWN! THAT&#39;S HOW THEY GET YOU!
&gt; 
&gt; **Maureen W.:** Not a chance, Hilda! Not when we&#39;re so close! 
&gt; 
&gt; (She strikes the rod against the guardrail. An otherworldly clanging sound resonates through the hollow rod, striking an unseen psychic chord with all the creatures of the deep, and for a merciful few seconds, the oceans are silent, as if to solemnly acknowledge what inevitably is to come)
&gt; 
&gt; **Kevin M.:** Do that again and I&#39;m telling the Yacht Club you&#39;re trying to sabotage the paint job.
&gt; 
&gt; **[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-169 &lt;UNKNOWN&gt;:]** **These the wankers you was talkin&#39; &#39;bout, Linda darlin&#39;?**
&gt; 
&gt; **Hilda N.:** //Explosive diarrhea!//
&gt; 
&gt; **[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-169 &lt;UNKNOWN&gt;:]** **Get fucked, Yanks.**
&gt; 
&gt; (Catastrophic marine seismic event, recording equipment is destroyed)
