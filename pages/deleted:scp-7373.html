caption= Photograph of SCP-7373 taken by Researcher Agnew within their 7th floor hotel room in ██████, United States. Subject escaped without issue.|width=250px]]
**Object Class:** Uncontained

**Special Containment Procedures:** All attempts to capture and contain SCP-7373 have resulted in failure due to the utilisation of its anomalous properties.

Accidental death cases are to be monitored for any mentions of a belt being the primary cause of the victim’s passing. Surveillance footage of such events is to be seized and witnesses appropriately amnesticized.

**Description:** SCP-7373 is an entity resembling a non-anomalous, black leather belt. Cognitive observation methods has confirmed SCP-7373 to be sentient and its awareness to be on a level granting it a low level of omniscience.

SCP-7373 manifests within occupied, enclosed structures containing a multitude of rooms and enclosed spaces separated by walls or similar dividers. SCP-7373 will initially appear in a location as far from any of the structure’s feasible exit points[[footnote]]Openings obviously unsafe to pass through such as windows on a high floor are exempt.[[/footnote]] as possible, occupied by a single human. In most cases, SCP-7373 will be located on the top floor of a building with multiple floors and rooms (Hotels, office blocks, apartment complexes, etc) SCP-7373 will remain inactive until the human subject present trips over it. After the subject has exited the room, SCP-7373 will disappear from its previous location, reappearing somewhere in the environment the subject has just entered.

SCP-7373 will appear in an area where it will likely go unnoticed by the subject and ultimately result in them tripping over it. SCP-7373 will continue to reappear in the following rooms the subjects enters, until the subject has exited the structure. SCP-7373 will then reappear in a new location either in the building, or another within the general area. 

Attempts to avoid SCP-7373 will only increase the likelihood of a subject being tripped over again, along with the inflicted injuries becoming increasingly more harmful, until eventually causing near-fatal damage. The inflicted injuries will steadily increase in complexity, often involving oncoming environmental factors that were not present beforehand, such as objects suddenly being introduced to or rearranged in the location. In most cases, subjects have suffered fatal blows to the cranium from tripping onto nearby furniture, or unassumingly hazardous items (Scissors, ball point pens, drinking glasses, lit candles, etc) being moved in the way as they fall.

Following a subject&#39;s death, SCP-7373 will instantly reappear in a different building somewhere in the world.

**Addendum:** It is currently theorised that SCP-7373 acts entirely on malicious intent. This was proposed following the discovery that all previously targeted subjects had been wearing belts at the time.</textarea></pre>
