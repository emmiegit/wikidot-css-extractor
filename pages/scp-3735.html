**Item #:** SCP-3735

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation scanners must analyze phonetics blogs and popular online linguistic databases for any recordings with a sonic match for SCP-3735.

In any cases where an SCP-3735b-positive individual produces SCP-3735, MTF Mu-143 “Prescriptivists” is to be deployed to use class-B amnestics upon all surviving SCP-3735a-negative individuals who are exposed, contain all SCP-3735b-positive individuals present, and provide Standard Linguistic Cover Story 78 (Pirahã Malaria Strain) to family members and friends of deceased or contained individuals. 

Any SCP-3735b-positive individuals contained are to be placed in Standard Humanoid Containment Units outfitted with full soundproofing.

**Description:** SCP-3735 is a cognitohazardous linguistic phone[[footnote]]In linguistics, a //phone// is defined as a distinct speech sound or gesture regardless of whether its exact sound is critical to the meaning of the word. This is distinct from a //phoneme//, which, if swapped with another phoneme, could alter the word&#39;s meaning. For instance, in English, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirated_consonant#Allophonic aspirated phones] are //allophonic// and do not alter the meaning of the word, whereas in Hindi aspirated phones are distinct phonemes.[[/footnote]] determined by Foundation linguists to be a pharyngeal nasal. According to non-anomalous phonetic analysis, said sound is impossible for human beings to produce. Nevertheless, approximately 0.03% of humans are anomalously able to produce SCP-3735 (a condition henceforth designated SCP-3735a). In most cases, this ability never manifests itself and SCP-3735a-positive individuals live normal lives, albeit at a statistically significant higher risk for late-life hearing loss.

However, when SCP-3735a-positive individuals are exposed to SCP-3735, they have a 93% chance of developing the ability to produce SCP-3735, upon which their condition is reclassified as SCP-3735b. SCP-3735b-positive individuals feel a compulsion to repeatedly produce SCP-3735, developing in multiple stages. 
* Stage B1 (immediately after exposure): SCP-3735 immediately replaces all dorsal nasals in the affected individual’s phonetic inventory. 
* Stage B2 (1 week after exposure): Coronal nasals, dorsal approximants, and any and all laryngeal consonants are replaced.
* Stage B3 (7 weeks after exposure): All nasals and approximants, as well as voiced coronal and dorsal fricatives, are replaced.
* Stage B4 (5 months after exposure): All consonants other than labial plosives and unvoiced labial fricatives are replaced, as well as all back vowels.
* Stage B5 (1 year after exposure): All phonemes are replaced with SCP-3735.

As far as Foundation linguists can determine, SCP-3735b is entirely unconscious and irreversible, whether by amnestics or by any other means. SCP-3735b-positive individuals can understand spoken language, and hear nothing abnormal about their own speech.

Upon being exposed to SCP-3735, SCP-3735a-negative individuals develop symptoms based on exposure time. These symptoms cease upon conclusion of exposure, and their effects can easily be removed from memory through use of class-B amnestics if concluded before reaching Stage A5.
* Stage A1 (upon exposure): Mild headache
* Stage A2 (thirty seconds of exposure): Throbbing headache, hyperventilation, a sensation of a “swollen tongue.”
* Stage A3 (one minute of exposure): Sharp headache, difficulty breathing, overproduction of saliva, visible swelling of the tongue
* Stage A4 (two minutes of exposure): Acute anaphylaxis
* Stage A5 (three minutes of exposure): The pharynx and tongue [REDACTED], inevitably causing severe blood loss and expiration.

**Recovery:** SCP-3735 was first identified in 2015, when an SCP-3735b-positive individual posted a recording of SCP-3735 in an online linguistics hobbyist group. Foundation online automated auditory memetic hazard scanners were triggered, and upon investigation by a Foundation linguist SCP-3735&#39;s anomalous properties were identified. The recording was deleted, SCP-3735a-negative listeners were treated and amnestized, and MTF Mu-143 “Prescriptivists” was deployed to contain the recording&#39;s originator, by the name of C██████ N████. 

&gt; **Interviewed:** C██████ N████, SCP-3735b-positive individual
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. I████ P███████, Foundation linguist
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** This interview was, except when //marked in italics//, conducted solely through written means, so as to prevent exposure to SCP-3735.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **C██████ N████:** I don&#39;t know what you are doing here, but it has got to be illegal.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. P███████:** This will go a lot easier for you if you cooperate, sir. When did you first develop the ability to produce a pharyngeal nasal sound?
&gt; 
&gt; **C██████ N████:**  I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. P███████:** Are you aware of the fact that your phonetic inventory is abnormal?
&gt; 
&gt; **C██████ N████:** I don&#39;t know what you mean.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. P███████:** So that&#39;s a no, then. Okay. Have you noticed any odd reactions to your voice? Things you wouldn&#39;t have expected?
&gt; 
&gt; **C██████ N████:** For instance?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. P███████:** Well, headaches, aches and pains, nosebleeds, difficulty breathing...
&gt; 
&gt; **C██████ N████:** Well, I don&#39;t go out much – I&#39;m not a very social person. Most of my time I spend on the Internet, and I can order food online – I work from home. The last time I tried to talk to someone, she left in, like, thirty seconds. She said she had a bad headache, and never came back. I think that was a pathetic excuse. What a bitch.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. P███████:** Ah. So when was the most recent time you had a full conversation with someone?
&gt; 
&gt; **C██████ N████:** Why are you judging me for being antisocial? At least I work from home at a normal job, instead of at some sort of weird secret research facility.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. P███████:** Again, it would be easier for both of us if you work with us. When was the most recent time you had a full conversation with someone?
&gt; 
&gt; **C██████ N████:** I guess it was about five months ago. An old friend from ████ High[[footnote]]Said school has not been identified.[[/footnote]] called me. I don&#39;t know how he got my number, to be honest. But we talked for a few minutes until he abruptly hung up. Don&#39;t know why.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. P███████:** Can you tell me this high school friend&#39;s name?
&gt; 
&gt; **C██████ N████:** You know, I can&#39;t quite remember right now. It started with an N, I think. From Brazil[[footnote]]Said individual has not been identified. He has been reclassified as PoI-3735 for the time being.[[/footnote]]. Can I go now?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. P███████:** I&#39;m afraid that won&#39;t be possible. //Security, put Mr. N████ here in a regular quiet box.// Sorry about this, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** It seems clear from this interview that SCP-3735b-positive individuals are completely unaware of their condition. This could be a difficulty in maintaining containment.

**Addendum:** [[collapsible show=&#34;+RESTRICTED to clearance level 3 and up&#34;hide=&#34;-Clearance approved&#34;]]
As of 13 May 2018, reports have come in of a remote tribe in the Amazon Basin whose language makes regular use of SCP-3735, whose members show no signs of any of the effects of SCP-3735 exposure. This group has been tentatively assigned as GoI-3735. Connections to PoI-3735 are being investigated.
