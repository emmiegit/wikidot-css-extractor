“Agent Powell, this is Site 42. Do you have eyes on the target?”

“Negative, doc. Team is in position. We’re approaching manifestation time. Subject should arrive within the next half-hour.”

“Good. Make this a clean retrieval.”

“Right, right… Uh, doc? Can I ask you a question?”

“Is it relevant to your mission?”

“Well, sort of. It’s just that, you know… It’s a full moon, right? And I was wondering, uh… Are we hunting a werewolf?”

“… Negative, Agent Powell. You’re pursuing a metamorphic entity with transformations based off of the lunar cycle.”

“Yeah, but I read the briefing. It turns into a wolf.”

“It is a humanoid being which gains physical traits similar to that of //Canis lupus//, yes.”

“Okay, but that’s a werewolf.”

“Agent Powell, ‘werewolf’ is an unscientific term, and it should not be used to describe an anomaly we do not yet have a full understanding of.”

“You gave us silver bullets.”

“Testing on DNA samples gathered from previous manifestation sites has shown that silver&#39;s molecular structure causes it to be able to penetrate the subject&#39;s unusually thick epidermis. Now, Agent Powell, if you could please focus...”

“But that’s just it! I can’t focus! This has opened up the floodgates for me! I mean, if werewolves are real, what else is? Like, are vampires real? Are Frankensteins real?”

“No. And Frankenstein was the doctor, not the monster.”

“Are mummies real?”

“No. Wait. Technically? I mean, they definitely exist, but do you mean the ones that walk around? No. No, never mind.”

“What about the Loch Ness Monster? Or the chupacabra? See, I can’t stop wondering now.”

“Agent Powell, if you don’t stop this, I&#39;ll have to have a word with your commanding officer.”

“What about dinosaurs? Are dinosaurs real?

&#34;What? Yes. Of course they&#39;re real. Dinosaurs weren&#39;t an anomaly. Now, Agent Powell, I&#39;m ending communications. If you could please just--&#34;

“Is Bigfoot real?”

“...&#34;

&#34;Doc? Are you still there?&#34;

And that’s the story of how Agent Powell got demoted to file clerk.</textarea></pre>
