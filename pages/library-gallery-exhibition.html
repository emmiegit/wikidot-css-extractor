//**&#34;Standing on the Shoulders of the Phoenix: Discovery and Rediscovery in Post-Millenial ReCreationist Anart&#34;**//
[[/=]]
&gt; **Michael Petrakovich**
&gt; Canadian, 1976-2043
&gt; 
&gt; **//Every Day Is Wednesday//**
&gt; 2003-04
&gt; Blood, sweat, and fears on canvas;
&gt; Oils on juniper wood.
&gt; Donated to the Library by the artist.
&gt; 
&gt; The first piece produced by M. Petrakovich following his abandonment of the &#34;shock and destroy&#34; tactics of the art collective &#34;Are We Cool Yet?&#34;, //Every Day Is Wednesday// is an important and breathtaking viewpoint into the artist&#39;s struggles to redefine himself as a member of the ReCreationist school of anart rather than as a Pseudo-Deconstructionist.
&gt; 
&gt; The references to the traditional style of surrealism are most pronounced in the usage of inks composed of blood samples from Picasso, Dal√≠, and Masson, combined with sweat from the artist himself. Petrakovich&#39;s use of synaesthetic effects is given full freedom here, with gustatory-tactile and auditory-proprioceptive responses most often reported. Also note the unique use of ocher and crimson in order to provoke the sensation of drunkenness, a cognitive effect Petrakovich used to great effect in later pieces.
&gt; 
&gt; The secondary and more infamous effect has been described by the artist as &#34;fuck copyright&#34; and consists of any indirect representations, including photography, video feed, hand-drawn sketches, clairvoyance, astral projection, and scrying, to only produce an altered copy of this descriptive plaque with the majority of the text replaced by the following phrase: &#34;Suck it bitches. You got to see to believe.&#34;
