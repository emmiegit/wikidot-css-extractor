[[[Lecana]]] blew into my [[[Spring|father]]]’s courtroom, panting and wild eyed. She swallowed hard and turned to us.

“Summer” she gasped. 

Father was stunned for a moment.

“What is it child? What’s happened?”

“They… She… She’s gone.”

“Who? You’re not making any sense.”

“Autumn! She… she’s //gone//.”

“What do you mean, gone?” I asked.

“I-I don’t know. It was S-summer. They did //something// and Autumn she just vanished.” 

At last word she held up what she had been holding; a simple wooden mask. We all recognized it of course, it was Autumn’s. My father tensed. He knew something.

“Sander!” He shouted for his Equinox, and the short bald man rushed in.

“Yes m’lord?” He said, eyeing my shaking sister nervously.

“Escort my daughter to her chambers, and then call the others at once.”

He turned to me. 

“Monsoon, find your brothers. I need to speak to them immediately”

---- 

My brothers have never been easy people to find, and they like it that way. Both as stubborn and capricious as our Father, and flighty as their nymph mother. Kiri was the easier to track down, I found him prancing through a waterfall, of all places. He heard me coming.

“Little brother. I sense this is not a social visit.”

I hated that. Kiri always seemed to know things he couldn’t possibly be able to.

“Afraid not. Father charged me with asking you to-”

“Yes, yes, I know, that nasty business with Summer and our dear sister. How am I required?”

“Autumn’s child. Do you know where to find him?”

“But of course I do! The broody sod is always sulking in the same place.”

“We need you to bring him to the court.”

“Ah. Well. That won’t be particularly easy. The boy is… temperamental, and never much fond of the courtier lifestyle.”

I glared at him.

“Oh fine. I’ll get him. But I won’t like it”

----

Barasatta was harder to find. In fact, he found me. He sat at my fire as I returned from a hunt. 

“Monsoon! Our brother tells me you need a favor”

Dammit. I should have guessed Kiri knew where he was.

“He’s right. It’s father.”

“Working as the old goat’s errand boy, eh?” He chuckled. “What is it, then?”

“Seco.”

“Summer’s bastard? Is he working with those damn traitorous-”

“He’s gone. Whatever Summer has been using to deal with his enemies. We need you to find him.”

“I know” He smiled, unbearably smug. “I’ve already started looking. In fact, I’ve found him.”

“What? Where?”

“Oh, here and there. Never you worry, brother dear.”

With that, he blew away, a pompous thunderstorm in the wind. 

In a few hours the sun would rise, oppressive as ever.
