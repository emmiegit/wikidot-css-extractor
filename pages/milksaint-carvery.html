//Commentary by Dr. Drenchat Egarszoon Holian, PhD, DDiv, Director of the Lyons Imperial University Center for Heresiographical Research. Edited by Natalla Drenchatsdochter Pfalz-Holian, Adjunct Professor of Literature, Lyons Imperial University.//

This hagiography -- or &#34;hagiogram&#34; -- was composed c. 695 BIE (ShipYear 540 in the local calendar) by the Freedreamer sect of the generation-ark //Tsiolkovsky//. The Freedreamers had their origins in the Casteless Movement, a revolutionary political party that replaced the ship&#39;s corporate oligarchy with an egalitarian democracy and eliminated its hereditary caste system. Milksaint Carvery -- then known as Milkwright Carvery -- was one of the primary architects of the Casteless Movement, and soon after their assassination in 810 BIE (SY 425) became one of the first saints of the nascent Freedreamer sect. The text is written in FreeCant, a non-Standard dialect used by the Freedreamers as a liturgical language; with the glosses included in the commentary, it should be relatively intelligible to most modern readers. If you still cannot understand it, look for the translated version in the Young Reader&#39;s Edition of //Holian&#39;s Heretical Hagiographies//, coming to children&#39;s bookstores some time next year. (Natalla, can I actually write this? I think it would be hilarious. Remind me to cut this sentence, by the way.[[footnote]] //Editor&#39;s Note: This chapter, and the remaining sixty-seven chapters of// HHH//, are entirely unedited; I blame my son, Liutpold, who decided he wanted to be born a full month and a half before his due date. I would offer my apologies, but my father says he prefers it this way.// [[/footnote]])

&gt; throbbing withways. hekatomb branching nightmare[[footnote]]This phrase begins to appear in Freedreamer hagiographies around 750 BIE, and by the turn of the century it’s a universal element of the genre. I cannot find any commentaries of the time explaining why this would be the case, nor any explanation of its meaning. My personal theory? It just sounds cool. Say it to yourself. Really get your jaw around those syllables. Fantastic. [[/footnote]]. name STEEL name STONE name MILKSAINT CARVERY. ectopic mothergutter, wombripped glasscradler[[footnote]] Glasscradler: a child gestated in an artificial womb.

[[/footnote]] / stoway / genepurged[[footnote]] Genepurged: A punishment for certain particularly heinous crimes, similar to //damnatio memoriae//. All records of the offender are purged from the ship&#39;s databanks, including their genetic code. [[/footnote]].) clan CARVER belonged mothername, suffixed bastardwise CARVERY. praenomen ungiven.

[[/footnote]], castenamed MILK agcaste dairyguild[[footnote]]A full explanation of the caste and guild system would be entirely out of scope for this commentary; while this hasn&#39;t stopped me before (my fourth book, //Those That Will Permit Fire: A Biography of Gulnisa Akramova, Book-Burner// was originally published as footnote 47 of chapter 6 of my third book, //Xenolatry//), I have decided to take pity on my editor and my keyboard this time. Suffice it to say that poor Carvery was destined for the life of a milkmaid. Or milkman. Or milkperson. We aren&#39;t sure what their gender was, actually. Possibly nobody was at the time. [[/footnote]]. creched + schooled SEVENHULL, SIGMADECK, THREEAFORE SIXAPORT[[footnote]] The //Japheth//-class generation-arks had a standardized layout, with twelve hulls divided into twenty-four decks, from Alphadeck on the outer ring to Omegadeck adjacent to the spindle; Carvery&#39;s home-block was three blocks forward and six counter-clockwise from the deckhall (the central administration building).

Penitence Kim&#39;s hagiogram survives only in fragments; he was known as the father of Freedreamer asceticism, and lived for ninety-six years on a diet of nutrient paste and water. [[/footnote]]). cruelty apprenticewise KIM, starver, forceworker, mostall shocklasher[[footnote]] A shocklash was a thin whip with built-in nerve-impulse pain-inducers, originally developed by the //Tsiolkovsky//&#39;s security forces for crowd control. It was quickly adopted by all strata of society on the ark as a tool for torturing dissidents and abusing servants (and apprentices).

&gt; &gt;MIRACLE ALPHA[[footnote]] The Miracle-verse is a core component of Freedreamer hagiograms. Miracle-verses are always five-line stanzas, with a 5-7-5-7-5 syllable pattern; all extant hagiograms have an odd number of miracle-verses, usually either three, five, or seven, although a few minor saints only have one, and all hagiograms of Omega Freequeen (see below) have nine.

[[/footnote]], casteless freeguilds[[footnote]] Freeguilds: unofficial organizations for professions not recognized by the traditional caste and guild hierarchy (e.g. actors, prostitutes, tattoo artists). Some of these were semi-legal, and tolerated by the oligarchic regime; others were essentially organized criminal gangs (most notably the Narcoguild, responsible for the production and distribution of illicit drugs). Freeguilds of both types were critically important to the Casteless Movement. [[/footnote]] encraving; soothsaid crosspath Ω FREEQUEEN, SAINT-OF-SAINTS[[footnote]] Omega Freequeen was the political and philosophical head of the Casteless Movement and the messiah of the Freedreamers. Born Omega Lawscribe Nguyen to an affluent govcaste family, Omega did well in university and was beginning an apprenticeship with a prominent lawyer when (according to tradition) she was visited in her dreams by the voice of God, who commanded her to free the people of the //Tsolkiovsky// from the oligarchic regime. She broke her apprenticeship contract the next morning and left for Twelvehull, where she wrote for a radical newspaper and provided pro bono legal services for the poor. By the time she met Carvery, she was a well-established force in the Twelvehull underground. [[/footnote]].

[[/footnote]] eachother. daywise rabbleroused, nightwise starcrossed[[footnote]] Starcrossed: Engaged in a doomed love affair. Natalla insisted I gloss this, because she did not know what it meant; apparently, one is no longer required to study Shakespeare in pursuit of a literature degree. My heart weeps. [[/footnote]], shipwide casteless insurgency. halfagainyear finality; revoleve[[footnote]] Revoleve: contraction of &#34;revolution eve&#34;. Revoleve and Revolday were important high holidays for the Freedreamers, and marked the start of a new liturgical year. [[/footnote]] councilmeet infiltrated, decapintended[[footnote]] Decapintended: contraction of &#34;decapitation intended&#34;, &#34;decapitation&#34; referring to the assassination of a leader rather than a literal head-cutting-off. You would think they wouldn&#39;t need a word for this, but it comes up a lot. I don&#39;t think anyone has been almost-assassinated as much as Omega Freequeen. Except maybe Emperor Tycho IV, cognomed (I&#39;m starting to adopt some of the FreeCant vocabulary. Very useful.) &#34;Felix&#34; (&#34;Lucky&#34;) because of all the times he managed to avoid assassinations by sheer chance. Died peacefully in his sleep at the age of one hundred and thirty-five, about ten minutes before the next assassin crawled in through his window. Can you imagine the look on that poor bastard&#39;s face? [[/footnote]], Ω regicide almost:

The original Freedreamer sect is no longer extant; the last record of them can be dated to c. 220 BIE, two centuries after the //Tsiolkovsky// reached its final destination (Vortigern, a verdant moon of a gas giant in the Dumnarth system), when the last remaining Freedreamer communities were purged as dissidents by a local dictator. Their sacred texts were preserved by the library of Vortigern Planetary University (now Vortigern Imperial Technical Institute)[[footnote]] For more on the history of the Freedreamers and the //Tsiolkovsky//, see //The Hagiograms, Unabridged// by Epsilon Hockberger and //The Will of the Universe: Revolution and Religion on the Ark// by Annabella Lippincott, both published by Vortigern Imperial Press. [[/footnote]]. A small reconstructionist Freedreamer community has been active on Vortigern for about half a century, although by their own admission many of the actual practices of the Freedreamers have been lost. I give them another two generations, max.
