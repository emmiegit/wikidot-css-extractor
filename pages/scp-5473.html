**Item #:** SCP-5473

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5473 has been officially designated as uncontainable however, procedures have been put into place to limit the public&#39;s exposure to SCP-5473. An exclusion zone has been established around SCP-5473-A under the guise of a failed CIA operation and subsequent international tension. 

Locations with high concentrations of SCP-5473-2 are to undergo misinformation plan Rip Van Winkle. Any instances of SCP-5473-1 or SCP-5473-2 are to be sequestered in the low-security wing of Site-██.

**Description:** SCP-5473 is a phenomenon affecting those who have entered an approximately one hundred square kilometer area within the Nanda Devi National Park, India. This zone has been designated SCP-5473-A.

Subjects affected by SCP-5473 have been designated as SCP-5473-1 and SCP-5473-2 depending on the stages of the effect.
 
SCP-5473-1 experience an inability to feel fear, pain, or similar negative stimuli. This inability has often led to the death of SCP-5473-1 before entering Foundation custody or transitioning to SCP-5473-2. Instances have reported recurring dreams but are unable or unwilling to divulge the details of these dreams. SCP-5473-1 cases have been recorded to last as few as 4 days with some cases continuing for years. There are 14 SCP-5473-1 instances in custody at Site-██ that have been in the first stage for more than 5 years at the time of writing. It is unclear if there is an upper bound to this stage. 

SCP-5473-2 experience a persistent catatonic state with minimal brain activity. Brain activity has been observed to spike during periods of sleep; it is assumed that SCP-5473-2 also experience recurring dreams, but this has not been confirmed. Subjects in this stage lack any drive toward self-preservation and must be carefully monitored to ensure that all necessities of life are met.

The transition from SCP-5473-1 to SCP-5473-2 is accompanied by an audio negation event. This event has been designated as SCP-5473-B. The mechanism of this audio negation is not known. This event is centered around the transitioning subject. The area of this audio negation has not been accurately recorded but exceeds a radius of 20 meters. Any persons within this radius at the time of the event have fallen under the effect of SCP-5473 and are to be designated further instances of SCP-5473-1.

The nature of SCP-5473 makes interviews of SCP-5473-1 difficult. Representative interviews have been attached below. The full repository of interviews can be accessed in the directory /SCP-5473/Interviews.

**Interviewed:** SCP-5473-1-273, Sarah Steevers, Age: 45

**Interviewer:** Dr. Kurt

**Foreword:** SCP-5473-1-273 was found by paramedics in a residence in suburban Chicago along with SCP-5473-2-272 (deceased) and SCP-5473-1-274. SCP-5473-1-273 was dehydrated and malnourished at time of retrieval. SCP-5473-1-273 was brought into Foundation custody through standard channels and interviewed upon arrival.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Dr. Kurt:** Hello Sarah, I&#39;m Dr. Kurt. You can call me Chris, if you&#39;d prefer. I&#39;d like to talk to you about what happened to Jason. Is that okay?

**SCP-5473-1-273** Okay.

**Dr. Kurt:** You were the one that called for an ambulance right?

**SCP-5473-1-273** Yes. It seemed like he should probably eat, but he wasn&#39;t. 

**Dr. Kurt:** You tried to feed him?

**SCP-5473-1-273** No. But it had been 8 days? 9? - since he&#39;d been up and eaten. 

**Dr. Kurt:** And that had been around the time that you had - let me get this right - &#34;heard the silence&#34;?

**SCP-5473-1-273** Yes, the beautiful silence. I had been listening to my favorite song and then the silence ended the horrible noise. I guess that was when Jason sat down.

**Dr. Kurt:** Sat down? You mean on the floor where the paramedics found him?

**SCP-5473-1-273** Yes, that&#39;s where. He sat down there in the silence. It&#39;s easier to enjoy it when you sit down, when you stop.

**Dr. Kurt:** And do you remember what happened after the paramedics arrived?

**SCP-5473-1-273** No. I was in my room. It didn&#39;t seem important.

**Dr. Kurt:** I&#39;m sorry to be the one to tell you this, but Jason didn&#39;t make it. It seems pretty obvious that he died of dehydration. He didn&#39;t have anything to drink did he?

**SCP-5473-1-273** No. He wasn&#39;t a drinker.

**Dr. Kurt:** I mean, he had no water for more than a week. He&#39;s dead.

**SCP-5473-1-273** Okay.

**Dr. Kurt:** Ma&#39;am, your husband is dead.

**SCP-5473-1-273** Okay. Can I go back to my bed? I was having the most wonderful dream.

**Dr. Kurt:** Can you tell me about the dream?

**SCP-5473-1-273:** No. I don&#39;t remember.

**Dr. Kurt:** Sarah, I need you to be honest with me.

[SCP-5473-1-273 does not speak, but looks toward Dr. Kurt]

**Dr. Kurt:** I&#39;d like to talk to you about what&#39;s happened. We&#39;d like to get some answers.

**SCP-5473-1-273:** There are no answers. Everything is just noise.

**Dr. Kurt:** Please, Sarah, we believe that whatever happened to Jason could happen to you as well. If we know more we might be able to stop it.

**SCP-5473-1-273:** Why would you stop the silence?

**Dr. Kurt:** If not for you, for the other people. There are hundreds suffering the same way you are. Can you please help?

**SCP-5473-1-273:** There is no suffering, don&#39;t you understand? Can I go back to sleep? 

**Dr. Kurt:** If you answer a few questions, yes, I&#39;ll have you taken back to your bed.

**SCP-5473-1-273:** Okay. Ask.

**Dr. Kurt:** Did Jason ever travel to India. To a place called Nanda Devi?

**SCP-5473-1-273:** Yes. He and his friends went there to climb a mountain or something.

**Dr. Kurt:** Friends? Do you remember who they were?

**SCP-5473-1-273:** Tyler and Matthew, I think. It&#39;s really loud in here.

**Dr. Kurt:** Can we have the fan turned off? Thank you. Sarah, do you remember their last names?

[[A click can be heard followed by the cessation of background hum.]]

**SCP-5473-1-273:** No. It&#39;s not important.

**Dr. Kurt:** Sarah, this is very important, I assure you. But we&#39;ll come back to them. Did your husband act strangely when he came back from that trip? Do you remember when that trip was?

**SCP-5473-1-273:** He was really quiet when he came back. He didn&#39;t like me playing music, but he was much less angry than normal. Really calm. He must have heard the silence. Doctor, you should hear the silence, you won&#39;t need to ask these questions.

**Dr. Kurt:** I don&#39;t know about that. But you didn&#39;t answer my second question. Do you remember when that trip was?

[SCP-5473-1-273 is unresponsive]

**Dr. Kurt:** Sarah, please answer my question.

[SCP-5473-1-273 is unresponsive]

**Dr. Kurt:** Okay. I guess we&#39;re done for today. Please take her back.

**Note:** Interviews of SCP-5473-2 instances were once thought to be impossible, but the development of the Moksha Protocol has provided some success. We&#39;d never been able to get details of the dreams before. Are they antimemetic?

- Dr. C. Kurt

**Interviewed:** SCP-5473-2-274, ████████ Steevers, Age: 19

**Interviewer:** Dr. Kurt

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Dr. Kurt:** Is the hypnosis complete?

**Assistant:** Yes. We&#39;ve already administered the mnestic as well. The subject should be as coherent as we can get them.

**Dr. Kurt:** Can you describe what you&#39;ve been dreaming of?

**SCP-5473-2-274:** No. [[footnote]]**Transcriptionist&#39;s note:** This mic might need replaced. Every time the subject speaks all ambient noise ceases.[[/footnote]]

**Dr. Kurt:** No, as in you can&#39;t? Or you won&#39;t describe what you experienced?

**SCP-5473-2-274:** No. There was no experience.

**Dr. Kurt:** But you were telling others that you had seen a woman. I believe you had called her a goddess, isn&#39;t that true?

**SCP-5473-2-274:** That&#39;s true. I saw what she wasn&#39;t and she was beautiful.

**Dr. Kurt:** Wouldn&#39;t you call seeing something an experience?

**SCP-5473-2-274:** No, not like this. I didn&#39;t experience it. I don&#39;t know how to explain it. It was like - like there was so much I didn&#39;t see that I knew it was her.

**Dr. Kurt:** Can you try to describe what you saw?

**SCP-5473-2-274:** I was somewhere that wasn&#39;t a place. It wasn&#39;t the city, and I don&#39;t think it was the forest because the trees around me definitely weren&#39;t trees. They looked like them, and I touched one. But it felt like it wasn&#39;t a tree. There was light in the shadows of the trees where the darkness couldn&#39;t reach. After a while, before I got there, there was a clearing where there were no trees the darkness illuminated a pile of gray shapes that weren&#39;t stones. There was a clear liquid that absorbed all of the darkness running over the pile of shapes and gathering in a wide hole in front of them. And she was there at the edge of the pool - her face was shining with darkness. She was the absence of want, pain, and fear.

**Dr. Kurt:** Did she say anything to you?

**SCP-5473-2-274:** No. Her voice was beautiful silence.

**Dr. Kurt:** Was there anything in the silence? Any kind of message?

**SCP-5473-2-274:** Yes. She promised us oblivion. That all suffering would end. She&#39;s here now in all the places where nothing exists.

**Dr. Kurt:** She&#39;s here now? Can you see her?

**SCP-5473-2-274:** She&#39;s nowhere. Nowhere is everywhere something isn&#39;t, y&#39;know? And she&#39;s there.

[Recording continues in silence for roughly 10 minutes][[footnote]] **Transcriptionist&#39;s note:** I&#39;d transcribe what I heard in that silence here if there were words worthy of it. It was the most beautiful thing I&#39;ve ever heard. [[/footnote]]
