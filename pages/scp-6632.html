**Item #:** SCP-6632

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6632 will remain a functioning restaurant under control of the SCP Foundation. Researchers will pose as either managers or employees of SCP-6632. If SCP-6632 exceeds its budget for any fiscal year, it will temporarily close under the guise of renovations until further appropriations have been secured.

**Description:** SCP-6632 is a sentient taco restaurant named &#34;Tcao Time&#34;[[footnote]]Presumably based on the local &#34;Taco Time&#34; series of restaurants; food produced in SCP-6632 is sourced by &#34;Taco Time&#34; suppliers, and it is listed as a &#34;Taco Time&#34; franchise in company records.[[/footnote]] located in the West Valley Mall in Spokane, Washington, United States of America, Earth.

SCP-6632&#39;s brain consists of a large mass of fat and neurons located in a cavity behind the main &#34;Tcao Time&#34; sign. These neurons extend to many of the appliances inside the store, including the cash register, stove, fryer, and refrigerator. SCP-6632 communicates by printing words and crude figures onto the cash register&#39;s thermal paper. SCP-6632 is not capable of arithmetic or higher-order mathematical reasoning.

SCP-6632&#39;s brain has been extensively damaged. SCP-6632 possesses the approximate mental capacity of a five year old child, and simple questions can require several days of thought before a coherent response.

SCP-6632 consumes food produced during its normal operation. Food is consumed via a hole located near the deep fryer; food inserted into the hole is conveyed upwards to a large digestive pouch via a small series of mechanical conveyor belts. As the rate of food return is high, SCP-6632 is easily able to ingest its required daily caloric intake.

SCP-6632 secretes a mixture of glycerine and additives through several holes located in the ceiling of the kitchen area. This fluid appears to act as cushioning for SCP-6632&#39;s brain and digestive organ. This mixture is nontoxic and is not anomalous.

According to the owner of SCP-6632, brain damage occurred when the sign was removed to fix the typo. The owner, thinking that the biological material was mold, attempted to remove it with bleach. An estimated 70% of SCP-6632&#39;s brain was damaged during this procedure.

SCP-6632 first came to Foundation attention when it was discovered that the owner of SCP-6632 was selling large amounts of a glycerine-based mixture to a group of fetishists[[footnote]]The mixture, when placed in adult diapers, is ideal cushioning for aroused genitalia.[[/footnote]] online. Chemical tests by the purchaser revealed that the material had not been commercially synthesized.

The previous manager of SCP-6632 purchased the restaurant from the West Valley Mall, where it previously sat abandoned. No records indicate when SCP-6632 was constructed. Historical photographs indicate that its existence appears to at least date to the construction of the mall, and may predate it.
