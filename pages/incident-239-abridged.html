On ██-██-████, Dr. A. Clef made the following recommendation on the log re: [[[SCP-239]]]

&gt; //Let me get this straight: we&#39;ve got a hyperdangerous reality bender in containment, and instead of killing her, we give her a fucking spellbook and tell her she can only use magic we approve. Yeah, because 9-year-old girls never age, and never experiment with new things. And using her to contain other SCPs? Really? Whose bright idea was that?//
&gt; 
&gt; //Here&#39;s my proposal: a sword made out of telekill will be made, because a sword made out of a telepathy-cancelling metal can definitely penetrate a reality bender&#39;s invincible skin. Then, --I-- an operative kills her in her sleep. Anyone stands in my way, and --I&#39;ll-- the operative carrying out the mission will knife them with SCP-668.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Of course, considering that this girl is so powerful that if she just looks at you and thinks you&#39;re her friend, then you are, I&#39;m going to do it personally. Got a problem, 05 command?//
&gt; 
&gt; //Clef Out//

**Surveillance Log x92███, Date █-██-█████-██-████**

//4:45// VTOL 505 arrives at the landing pad.

//4:46// A security detachment arrives to secure Dr. Clef.

//4:47// Clef is escorted out of the VTOL, and made to lay on the ground. He is recorded as saying &#34;Clef bows before no man!&#34;

//4:48// The agents are distracted by a large flock of seagulls flying overhead, and Dr. Clef shoots them all in the chest. Clef is recorded to say &#34;Wait... that wasn&#39;t my tranquilizer gun.&#34; and &#34;Oh, my ass is grass.&#34;

//4:52// Further resistance from security personnel. Dr. Clef swears several times, and fires wildly into the crowd. No survivors.

//5:10// Dr. Clef enters Site 17

------

**Personal log of Dr. A. Clef, SL█**

Ah, fuck. I hate it when I&#39;m right. This wall wasn&#39;t here before. The little godling has already started reshaping the site. Soon, the speaker system will play exclusively Kidz Bop and One Direction. //The Horror//.

...shit, the door&#39;s gone! What the Hel- wait...

//[Clef bitchslaps some metal]//

Butterflies? Really, Konny? Really? Butterflies and your fucking camera? That&#39;s the best you can do? We have a horny fox woman down the hall, you know. You could&#39;ve sicced her on my balls. Hell, you could&#39;ve just turned the site&#39;s automated security on and told it to target me. I&#39;m the protagonist, so that wouldn&#39;t have worked, but still. But //butterflies?// You stupid son of a bitch. Glad I brought my flyswatter!

//[Another male voice is heard saying, &#34;Don&#39;t touch my babies!&#34;]//

**FEED UNAVALIABLE**

Cut to Dr. Clef: &#34;I love a good feed cut! You can be as violent as you want, and nobody will see it!&#34;

**FEED UNAVAILABLE**

Kondraki neutralized, declaring, &#34;It is highly implied that I have had my ass kicked!&#34;

------
**Personal log of Dr. A. Clef, SL█**

I&#39;ve never understood what Blackbox Kondraki&#39;s obsession with those damn butterflies was. Seriously. I squashed, like, 50 of those things back there. He&#39;s gonna be pissed when he wakes up.

I think that Konny&#39;s working for 239 now. There&#39;s only one explanation: she&#39;s made him a //Belieber//. I should&#39;ve killed the poor sunovabitch. It would&#39;ve been a mercy.

And I just ran into a friggin&#39; wall! Who the hell makes a camera flash like that? I think he said it was made with freakin&#39; caterpillars. What if he actually needed to take a picture at night, like at the Site 17 barbeque or something. He would set them all on fire! Fucking butterfly-worshiping idiot.

What&#39;s the term for an insect furry? A buggy or something? Yeah, that&#39;s what Konny is. A buggy. Anyway, turning on my ocular implants, which I totally have. I think I&#39;ll visit some friends.

------

//6:25// Security Team Bravo vanishes into thin air.

//6:30// Security Team Bravo reemerges, dressed like fucking knights. No, really, they have plate armor and everything. ...who the fuck wrote this?

//6:35// The clock now only works in 5-minute increments. Also, Clef kills a bunch of guys. Again. For someone claiming to hate Mary Sues...

//6:40// Clef enters containment chamber for SCP-091-ARC and proceeds to make sweet tree love to it, the --lucky-- depraved son of a bitch. 

//6:45// Containment Breach. Biohazard protocols engaged. Dr. Gears and Kain Pathos Crow are called in. Because two Senior Staff avatars weren&#39;t enough for this --tale-- &#34;incident report&#34;.

------
**Personal log of Dr. A. Clef, SL█**

I talked to Yoda once. He told me &#34;Nothing is true, all is permitted&#34;. Not sure what that has to do with the current situation, but I just like the quote.

I think I misjudged 408. Those things are like flying television screens.  I wish Elvis was still alive to shoot the damn things. Hell, even Keith Richards would help right now; he could chuck all of the lepidopteran TVs out the window. For all I know, they&#39;ve taken 239 out of the site already.

But if they did, I wouldn&#39;t be the damn protagonist of this ta- I mean incident report. And because I&#39;m Alto Clef, my special ability means that women find me repulsive! That&#39;s exactly why I was able to have... tree sex with... 091...

...well, that&#39;s a giant continuity hole. Who writes this crap?

Anyway, in exchange for sex, I let 091 out, causing the entire site to go into biohazard lockdown! Now, you&#39;re all trapped here with me! Relax, I&#39;m just here for the kid. Not like a dragon&#39;s gonna pop out of nowhere and tear the place to bits. This plan is absolutely flawless!

...okay, I swear to god, I heard a George Michael song just then. Weird.

------
**&lt;SCP-336&gt;** Alto, Honey, what are you doing here?

**&lt;Dr. Clef:&gt;** Just stopping in  to say hello, Lilly.

(At this point, the two of them start speaking a mixture of Elvish and Martian. Or at least it may as well be. Seriously, we&#39;re the biggest scientific entity on the fucking planet, and we can&#39;t translate a few lines of a dead language. Pathetic.)

**&lt;Clef:&gt;** Aww, that&#39;s sweet, but I gotta go kill a little girl now.

**&lt;SCP-336:&gt;** I&#39;m sorry, Dave, but I can&#39;t let you do that. (SCP-336 removes its vocal modulator)

**&lt;Clef:&gt;** What did I say about using my real name- (SCP-336 begins talking) Oh god my ears. It&#39;s like listening to 682&#39;s mating cry!

------
**FEED AVAILABLE**

**//&lt;8:05&gt;//** Inconsistent Timestamps detected. Preparing to detonate tactical nuke. Also, Clef&#39;s bleeding out of his ears. He is heard to state, &#34;Joke&#39;s on you, Lilly! I&#39;m deaf now! This plan is still absolutely flawless!&#34; 

**//&lt;8:06&gt;//** Dr. Clef is heard to state, &#34;Okay, if I&#39;m deaf, why the fuck do I keep hearing music?&#34;

**//8:07//** SCP-408 swarms around Dr. Clef. Visual contact lost.

Interview Log x████, Date: ██-█-████

&lt;O5-█&gt;: Gears, how the hell did you get dragged into this?

&lt;Dr.Gears&gt;: Processing question... I was working with Dr. Crow on his egg walker. We heard an alarm, heard that Clef was coming to destroy SCP-239. Dr. Crow climbed in SCP-244-ARC and rode off.

&lt;O5-█&gt;: Dr. Crow being... the dog everyone thinks can talk.

&lt;Dr.Gears&gt;: He can talk. You just have to believe in the Heart of the Foundation to hear him. Also, being telepathically receptive might help.

&lt;O5-█&gt;:...right. Then how come security footage from the time shows him trying to hump the Egg Walker&#39;s leg?

&lt;Dr.Gears&gt;: If a man has urges, who am I to judge them? After Crow drove off, I went to speak with SCP-239.

------

//8:12// Consistent timestamps restored. Nuclear launch cancelled. 

//8:20// Dr. Gears meets with SCP-239, who is listening to a cover song of Macklemore&#39;s //Thrift Shop// by Kidz Bop. Dr. Gears is seen to instinctively reach for a non-existent gun and attempt to self-terminate. 

//8:21// After destroying the music player in the room, Dr. Gears and SCP-239 converse for several minutes. 

&gt; Dr.Gears: Come with us, Cigarette.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-239: &#39;Sigurrós&#39;.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr.Gears: We need your assistance, Cigar. Dr. Clef has been placed under the Imperious curse by the Lord Ruler, and is using Allomancy to attempt to destroy you.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-239: Isn&#39;t that reference a tad obscure, Mr. Gears?
&gt; 
&gt; Dr.Gears: Someone&#39;s bound to get it. 

------
//8:21// Kain Pathos Crow enters the incident area, finds Kondraki, offers him a bottle of Chechnya Vodka, as well as healing him.

&gt; Dr. Crow: Woof woof bark bark woof.
&gt; 
&gt; Kondraki: Fuck the liquor, I need to be sober to fight that butterfly-killing son of a bitch.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Crow: Bark.
&gt; 
&gt; Kondraki: No, I don&#39;t hate Chechnya. That&#39;s Strelnikov. 
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Crow: (whines)
&gt; 
&gt; Kondraki: What&#39;s that, boy? Sigurrós&#39;s fallen down a well? (Springs up, restored to full strength) Let&#39;s go!

------

**Personal log of Kain Pathos Crow**

BARK BARK WOOF I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I&#39;M DOING. BARK HELP BARK BARK

------

//8:40// Decommissioning of SCP-122-D is interrupted by Dr. Crow driving the egg walker through a wall and trampling it to death with his walker. Dr. Crow was given a medal for this action.

------

//3:15// Random Bright Cameo! Hey, Bright, you wacky bastard, what&#39;s up?

&gt; Dr. Bright: I just jerked off to //Lolita//. It felt good.

That&#39;s Jack Bright, everyone! What a card!

//9:15// Bright escapes his solitary confinement and finds Clef. The following dialog ensues:

&gt; Dr. Clef: Bright, you sick fuck. I ought to kill you right fuckin&#39; now.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Bright: Kay.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Clef:...kay?
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Bright: I want to die! I live for death! C&#39;mon, Cleffy, put a bullet through my brain!
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Clef: ...Yeah, no. I&#39;m not about to feed into your autonecrophilia fetish. But I will do this. (Clef shoots Dr. Bright in his left testicle, and walks off, with Bright yeowling in pain)
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Bright: DO THE OTHER ONE!

------
9:50 Dr. Kondraki &amp; Dr. Clef meet. Sword-fighting ensues.

&gt; Kondraki: My voice gives me-
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Clef: Don&#39;t even go there, Konny. It&#39;s bad enough we had to steal a joke from YGX Abridged. Ugh! 
&gt; 
&gt; Kondraki: Man, you know what would be cool? If the Highlander theme was playing over this!
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Clef: C&#39;mon, Konny. We aren&#39;t completely without dignity here. Lord of the Rings would fit more, I think.

------

Interview Log x████, Date: ██-█-████

&lt;O5-█:&gt; Gears, why the hell did you tell her that a fictional character was controlling Clef? 

&lt;Dr.Gears:&gt; Because I didn&#39;t want to scare her.

&lt;O5-█:&gt; Fair enough. But tell me... //why the flying fuck did you tell her that Magic Missile was an actual thing?!//

&lt;Dr.Gears:&gt; Because I thought it was cool.

&lt;O5-█:&gt; But... you don&#39;t have emotions.

&lt;Dr.Gears:&gt; Exactly.

[MORE AWESOME SWORDFIGHTING]

&lt;Kondraki:&gt; Dammit, Clef, stop this madness! And don&#39;t make a Sparta Joke.

&lt;Dr. Clef:&gt; Madness? This is S- aww. And I&#39;m trying to kill her because her containment procedures have already failed! //With ME!//

&lt;Kondraki:&gt; What the Hell are you talking about?

//Sudden shout. A female voice can be heard shouting something like, &#34;I cast Magic Missile!&#34; There is a sudden sound of breaking metal, and a scream, then a loud roar.//[[footnote]] Actual prose[[/footnote]]

------
//9:51// Running Sword fight.

//9:55// Dr. Gears, SCP-239 and Dr. Crow enter from various angles, with SCP-239 firing a bolt of plasma at Dr. Clef, which breaks his sword. 

//9:56// A black light emits from Dr. Clef&#39;s body, which turns into... a dragon. No, really. A fucking dragon. 

&gt; Dr. Clef: Well, we just jumped the shark.
&gt; 
&gt; Kondraki: For once, Clef, I agree with you.

(Sound of firing weaponry)

------

//10:08// Dr. Gears and SCP-239 are suddenly in Site 17&#39;s strong room. While she is distracted looking at emergency supplies, Dr. Gears injects SCP-239 with a sedative.

&gt; Dr. Gears: Goodnight, Cigarette. Sweet dreams.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-239: It&#39;s... Sigurrós...

------
//10:20// Dr. Crow&#39;s egg walker suddenly generates a sword of light, and decapitates the... fucking dragon is this suddenly an alternate canon where the Foundation is a fairy tale? No? Then what the hell.

Supplemental Report 239 Abridged Post-incident interview, Dr. A. Clef

&gt; **Clef:** Konny-boy! How&#39;s the everything?
&gt; 
&gt; **Kondraki:** It&#39;s getting better, thank you for asking. Why the Hell did you try to kill 239? She&#39;s in a chemical coma, by the way.
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Because. She&#39;s God, I&#39;m Satan, and I want to kill God. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Kondraki:** That&#39;s a load of bull.
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Look in your heart. You know it to be true.
&gt; 
&gt; **Kondraki:** Don&#39;t start. You know I hate Star Wars.
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** That is why you fail.
&gt; 
&gt; **Kondraki:** Mmmm...
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** No, Blackbox. I //am// your Father. (Darth Vader noises)
&gt; 
&gt; **Kondraki:** Clef, I swear to God-
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** You mean 239. She is God. Think about it. Why do women hate me so much? Why do you think I lie so well? If I&#39;m the prince of lies, then I must be telling the truth!
&gt; 
&gt; **Kondraki:** Clef, I&#39;m leaving. Say one more word, and I swear...
&gt; 
&gt; **Clef:** Aren&#39;t you a little short for a Storm trooper?
&gt; 
&gt; **Kondraki:** (Inarticulate scream of rage)

**At this point, Dr. Clef was not brutally assaulted by Dr. Kondraki, but instead accidentally fell onto the corner of the table. Repeatedly. Seriously, we have video footage. It&#39;s above your security clearance. But even if he was beaten up by Dr. Kondraki, he totally had it coming.**</textarea></pre>
