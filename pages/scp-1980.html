**Item #:** SCP-1980

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-1980 is immovable, Research and Containment Site-79 has been built surrounding it, under cover of building a neutrino observation telescope.  Standard Foundation access restrictions apply.  

All active examples of SCP-1980-1 (whether found within SCP-1980 or elsewhere) are to be transported to Site-41 for containment and experimentation.  It is critical that no direct human contact is made with an instance of SCP-1980-1, outside of approved experiments.  

Any person believed to have been exposed to SCP-1980-1 is henceforth designated an example of SCP-1980-2, and is to be contained and transported to Site-41 for interrogation and forcible removal of SCP-1980-1.  After removal of SCP-1980-1, non-D-Class subjects may be given Class-A amnestics and released.  MTF operatives should be aware that it is possible to internally implant SCP-1980-1 within a subject, producing an example of SCP-1980-2 with no obvious anomalies.  SCP-1980-2 specimens may be housed in a standard humanoid containment cell and have no unusual care requirements.

SCP-1980-3, the mechanism for creation of additional examples of SCP-1980-1, is currently within SCP-1980.  Relocation to Site-41 will be undertaken when possible.  By O5 order, SCP-1980-3 is not to be used until such relocation takes place.  

Biological artifacts (SCP-1980-4 and SCP-1980-5) in suspended animation  within SCP-1980 are not to be disturbed.  If any such items become animate, they should be contained if possible, otherwise terminated.

**Description:** SCP-1980 is a structure located approximately 2.4 km under the Antarctic ice,  approximately 400 km from the South Pole at coordinates [REDACTED].  Based on the depth at which it was found, SCP-1980 was constructed approximately 14.5 million years ago in one of the last temperate zones on the Antarctic continent. 

Usage as a scientific research base is presumed based on finding:

(1)	A telescope, apparently fixed for long-term observation of an area of intergalactic space at coordinates [REDACTED].  No significant astronomic bodies or activity noted in this area.

(2)	Approximately 5000 examples of SCP-1980-1; metallic discs approximately 10cm in diameter, composed of a tungsten-rhenium alloy and partially overlaid with a crystalline structure of unknown composition. Interrogation of SCP-1980-2 subjects indicates that each SCP-1980-1 contains the consciousness of an individual of an unknown sapient race, presumed to be the builders of SCP-1980.  Based on the number of SCP-1980-1 found, SCP-1980 is part of a much larger complex or colony.

(3)	A biological containment area, containing several primitive hominids (SCP-1980-4) in suspended animation, as well as an entity (SCP-1980-5) closely resembling the description of a [REDACTED] within SCP-████.

(4)	SCP-1980-3, a machine used to create additional examples of SCP-1980-1, based on information gained through interrogating SCP-1980-2 subjects.

(5)	Records documenting the activities of the inhabitants of SCP-1980.  See Addendum 3 for translation of relevant excerpts.

A human subject in contact with SCP-1980-1 will have his/her higher mental functions dominated by those of the entity contained within SCP-1980-1. These subjects are designated SCP-1980-2. The process takes approximately six hours, during which the subject is unconscious. Upon awakening, SCP-1980-1 will have control of the subject, and significant access to the subject’s knowledge and memories. Removal of SCP-1980-1 negates this effect, leaving the subject physically unharmed, but disoriented in a manner resembling the application of amnestics. The degree of disorientation is commensurate with the amount of time exposed to SCP-1980-1.[[footnote]]Similarity between this technology and that observed in [[[SCP-1411]]] has been noted and investigation into a potential shared origin between the anomalies is under investigation.[[/footnote]]

Existing SCP-1980-1 instances contain the consciousness of the builders of SCP-1980.  However, it is apparently possible to create additional examples of SCP-1980-1 from any sapient being, using SCP-1980-3 and a blank template of SCP-1980-1.  68 such templates were found. The research team working on replicating SCP-963-1 has --successfully made use of SCP-1980 materials to create SCP-963-2-- determined it is not possible to recreate SCP-1980-3 or SCP-1980-1 templates using current human technology.

**Addendum 1:** SCP-1980 was discovered in 2010, when an automated distress signal activated and was intercepted by Foundation personnel.  The signal was traced and the surrounding area contained as Site-79.  Extensive hot-water drilling has allowed limited access to SCP-1980.

The initial research team investigating SCP-1980 was compromised by SCP-1980-1 exposure, before the effects of SCP-1980-1 were fully known. Team leader Dr. ████████ abandoned his post and removed approximately 500 examples of SCP-1980-1 from the site.  Dr. ████████ has not been recovered by the Foundation, and it is assumed that there are now a significant number of uncontained instances of SCP-1980-2, with unknown motivations.  MTF Zeta-29 is responsible for their ongoing capture and containment. 27 examples of SCP-1980-2 are contained as of ██/██/2012, including 6 intentionally-exposed D-Class subjects. 
 
**Addendum 2:** 

&gt; **Interviewed:** Dr. Martin, a member of the original exploration/containment team, and now an instance of SCP-1980-2
&gt;  
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Baker
&gt;  
&gt; **Foreword:** When it was discovered that the exploration team was compromised, all members other than Dr. ████████ were successfully contained and interrogated.
&gt;  
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Baker:** First, let’s dispense with the idea that you&#39;re unaffected by SCP-1980.  We know what SCP-1980-1 does, and we know your team was exposed.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Martin:** Fine.  Dr. ████████ will complete his mission no matter what I tell you.  You can’t stop us.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Baker:** Who exactly are &#34;us?&#34;
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Martin:** Our people.  We built the place you found.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Baker:** Where are you from?
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Martin:** [REDACTED].  We have no where else to go.  [REDACTED] was destroyed.  This is our home now.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Baker:** …and what do you intend to do here?
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Martin:** Live.  As long as we can.  We wear your people because we have to.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Baker:** Were you always like this? &#34;Wearing&#34; others? 
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Martin:** No, we were once like you, until we had to defend ourselves from…how to say it in your language…those who came from outside.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Baker:** So you were invaded?
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Martin:** Yes.  By the [REDACTED].  And their masters, the … Screamers from Beyond.  They are why we converted.  The Screamers could not see us afterwards.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Baker:** I see.  And you were watching, in case the invaders came back?
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Martin:** Yes.  They will! You should convert too! It&#39;s the only way to protect yourselves.  The process should work. We would help you.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Baker:** We should become like you?
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Martin:** Yes! You could wear your own bodies…you would hardly know the difference.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Baker:** I can see the advantages…still…
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Martin:** You must do it! They will come back! It will be too late then…
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt;  
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Subject grew agitated, and has regularly tried to convince Foundation personnel to use SCP-1980-3 to &#34;convert&#34; themselves into instances of SCP-1980-2.

**Addendum 3:** Excerpts from records found in SCP-1980, translated by subject D-19213 while exposed to an instance of SCP-1980-1.  

&#34;Contact lost with [REDACTED].  Can only assume the worst.  Hope they were able to convert themselves in time.&#34;

...

&#34;We watch the access point continually.  So far, we are safe here.&#34;

...

&#34;We were wrong! [REDACTED] are pouring out of the access point.  So many! They must plan to hit every Class-J planet in this part of the galaxy.  There was no escape after all.  Convert and prepare; what else can we do?&#34;

...

&#34;70% of us lost…need to find new hosts for the modules.  The local life here is incompatible for transfer.  ████████████ tried to merge with a captured [REDACTED]; knew that wouldn&#39;t work…they are too different.

...

&#34;One of the last … our bodies may feed [[[SCP-1050|the Screamers]]], but perhaps someone will find our minds.&#34;
