**Item #:** SCP-7157

**Object Class:** Safe 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7157 is to be kept inside a standard humanoid containment cell outfitted with a bed, books, desk, television and a private study. SCP-7157 does not require food, but can eat lunch at the site cafeteria if it wishes to. SCP-7157 is to be referred to as --“Jacob”-- &#34;Lieutenant Jacob.&#34; If referred to by its item number, it will become visibly upset, and will describe how “disrespectful” it is.

**Description:** SCP-7157 is a 6’0” male human of English descent. It has brown parted hair, green eyes, pale skin, and typically wears casual clothing, though when ordered by the foundation, it will wear standard-issued foundation uniforms. It weighs exactly 75kg, and is somewhat muscular. It speaks fluent British-English as its first language, but has been seen speaking German occasionally. 
    SCP-7157 has incredible strength and reflexes, along with incredible knowledge on firearms and other weapons, along with history. It has been noted to be extremely skilled at combat of any form, most notably hand-to-hand combat and gunfights. It also has extremely strategic thinking, able to calculate the probability of success of a task it is given. If engaged in combat, depending on if SCP-7157 is equipped with a weapon, it will begin proficient combat greater  than that of even the most elite MTF operatives. He has demonstrated enough strength to lift up to 135kg, easily allowing him to lift his aggressors in the air, before slamming them into the ground with tremendous force. SCP-7157 tries to kill his opponents quickly and efficiently, usually attacking areas that will kill or knock out his opponents quickly, such as the head or vitals. He typically avoids making his opponents suffer through pain.




    SCP-7157, when not in combat, is quite friendly and cordial with foundation staff, showing respect for “fellow intellectuals,” as it calls them. It also salutes higher-ranking personnel when he notices them. He enjoys interacting with other non-threatening sentient and sapient SCPs, such as SCP-073, SCP-999, and SCP-343. When interviewed, it gave foundation personnel much information about him. It stated he was born sometime in 1562, which would make it well over 450 years old. He also stated he was of Christian faith, specifically protestant. It also has a hobby of writing, and showed many of his works, which are currently being investigated.
    SCP-7157 has the appearance of a male in their mid 20s, despite being over 450. This is due to its main anomalous ability of immortality, but not in a normal sense. SCP-7157 can still be killed, however this requires much more damage than a normal human can sustain before expiring. It is able to survive wounds that would normally be fatal, such as several gunshot wounds to the head, heart or lungs. It also demonstrates a great pain tolerance, able to shrug off large injuries. After enough damage has been done to him, SCP-7157 will eventually collapse and expire, usually due to large amounts of blood loss. However, after five days have passed, SCP-7157 will reappear inside wherever he considers to be his home, which is currently his containment cell. 

**Discovery:** SCP-7157 was discovered in 2007 when undercover foundation agents within the British Armed Forces began hearing rumours of a British Special Air Service (SAS) operative seemingly coming back from the dead. After investigating this rumour, it eventually led the agents to a SAS Operative going under the name Jacob [REDACTED]. When questioned, he admitted to his anomalous abilities, stating “I live to serve. But I live forever. I was both blessed and cursed with immortality. So, I decided to use it to fight for the country I love, Britain.” He eventually agreed to go under foundation containment. Whilst being transported, he began to sing the lyrics to “Rule, Britannia!” When questioned about this, he stated that it comforted him.

**Interviewed:** [SCP-7157]

**Interviewer:** [Head Researcher Ellie]

**Foreword:** [In this interview, Researcher Ellie asked several questions about SCP-7157.]

**&lt;Begin Log, [7/9/2007 at 18:00]&gt;**


Researcher Ellie enters the room and takes a seat at a table in front of 7157. No other staff enter the room.

7157: “Ah, ello lass. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Lieutenant Jacob of the Special Air Service. And you are?”
Elli: “Hi, I’m Researcher Ellie.”
7157: “That’s a beautiful name.”
Ellie: “W-wow, thank you.”
7157: “Might I ask, what is happening? Why am I here?”
Ellie: “Yes, of course. We work for the SCP foundation. We contain anomalies and study them. We heard about your, uh, unique abilities and so we would like to study them.”
7157: “Ah. I see. So you and your colleagues study the things that don’t make sense, right?”
Ellie: “Yes, that’s right.”
7157: “Very well. I guess since there isn’t much else I can do, I’ll let you lot run some tests on me. Can’t be that hard, right?”
Ellie: “Thank you. These kinds of studies help us better understand the world.”
7157: “Right.”
Ellie: “So to get things started, may I ask a few questions about you?”
7157: “Of course.”
Ellie: “Great! Let’s get started. So, according to the report we have on you, you can come back from the dead. Is this true?”
7157: “Yes it is. I was born, eh, sometime in the 1560s, I think 1562. I lived a normal life mostly, until I died in 1590. But, five days later, I awoke in my home again. I was so confused. I was in a black void for what seemed like days, then suddenly I was awake back home. I thought it was a dream, but my friends were very startled when they saw me, saying I died five days earlier.”
Ellie: “So that’s how you discovered it?”
7157: “Yes.”
Ellie: “Ok. Next, when we discovered you, you were serving in the Special Air Service.”
7157: “Yes.”
Ellie: “How did you get in?”
7157: “Well, I was originally in the British Army, and I served for years. I even fought in the war on terror. But eventually, they invited me to join because of my performance.”
Ellie: “Did they know about your immortality?”
7157: “No, I kept that a secret. But I guess someone found that me coming back after being shot in the head several times was a little odd, because here I am now.”
Ellie: “You were shot in the head several times?”
7157: “Ah, yes. It was during the war on terror not too long ago. I was with my squadmates, we were combing the area for enemy activity. Then we got ambushed. Of course, I didn’t have time to react because I was the first to die. Three high-calibre rounds went through my head.”
Ellie: “I see. Well, our time is about up, I need to get back to my office.”
7157: “It was quite a pleasure speaking with you. You seem like such a lovely, intelligent young lass.”
Ellie: “Thank you, it was nice to meet you.”
7157: “You as well.”

**Interaction between Dr. Tyler Kaylee and SCP-7157 on 29/10/2008:**

7157: &#34;Hello. My name is Lieutenant Jacob, and-&#34;
Dr. Tyler: &#34;Greetings, SCP-7157.&#34;
7157: &#34;I beg your pardon? I do not believe that is my name.&#34;
Dr. Tyler: &#34;It is your assigned number, 7157.&#34;
7157: &#34;Well, how insulting! How very disrespectful! Did your mother never teach you to respect your elders?&#34;
Dr. Tyler: &#34;Elder? You look like you&#39;re twenty.&#34;
7157: *sighs* &#34;I am over 400! The exact number I don&#39;t really know, you lose track after a century or two, heh.&#34; 

[[/div]]


“I personally request permission to interview Jacob (SCP-7157) again, I wish to discover more about him and his past. I also request permission to begin testing with him.” -Head Researcher Ellie

**Addendum 1:** Permission to begin testing on SCP-7157 has been granted by O5 command. Researcher Ellie has been promoted to Head Researcher on SCP-7157, due to 7157’s cordial behaviour towards her. Testing on 7157&#39;s strength in combat is highly suggested.



[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Cross-Test Between SCP-7157 and SCP-999, authorised by Head Researcher Ellie:**

999 is introduced into 7157&#39;s cell. 999 becomes excited upon noticing 7157, and slithers towards it.*
7157: &#34;Why, hello, odd creature. Wow, never seen something like this before.&#34;
999 coos affectionately while leaping up on 7157 and hugging him with two pseudopods.
7157: &#34;Haha, why, you seem very excited, little one!&#34;
7157 begins laughing loudly as 999 begins tickling him. This goes on for three minutes, before 999 stops.
7157: &#34;Haha, wow, I haven&#39;t felt this good in decades! Oi, it smells like. . . chocolate in here! Heh.
7157 reaches down and pats 999, before 999 begins to slither out.
7157: &#34;Alright, you have a great day little one! Wow, never met such a pure spirit before.&#34;
[[/div]]
After this, 7157 remarked how enjoyable 999&#39;s presence was, and how it desired to see 999 again.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**2nd Test on SCP-7157, authorised by Head Researcher Ellie:**
Several weapons were introduced into SCP-7157’s cell. These included:
-A M16A2 Automatic Rifle
-A M4 Carbine
-A British-made SA80 Automatic Rifle
-A Steel Sword
-A “Brown Bess” Vintage Musket
7157 was then ordered to inspect these weapons. When presented with them, he commented on each one.
7157: “Ah, what do we have here? Ooh, a M16A2! Let’s see here… 30 round clip… with a ACOG scope attachment and green laser sight, along with a very nice suppressor.”
7157: “Ooh, a classic one. The M4 carbine. Very nice.”
7157: “Oh my, do my eyes deceive me? Is that not… an SA80! Haha, my personal favourite. This one is pure power! 30 round clip with an ELCAN LDS and a very nice grip, along with a standard suppressor. This bad boy was made back in the 1970s, but only came into service in 1985. Absolutely beautiful.”
7157: “Heh, a sword! Looks like it was recently polished too! Gleams like the sun.”
When 7157 approached the musket, he seemed shocked at it, and immediately grabbed it, and began inspecting it. It took a pause, before speaking.
7157: “This… this can’t be. You managed to find one of these? Wow… it’s got everything. The bayonet is still sharp, too. This is the Brown Bess musket. The musket used by our troops in the Revolutionary War. Oh, the memories…”
[[/div]]

After this test, 7157 has demonstrated a vast knowledge of firearms. After this test concluded, 7157 asked if it could keep the musket. Head Researcher Ellie agreed to let him keep it.
