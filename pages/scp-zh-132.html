**Special Containment Procedures:** The bodies of SCP-ZH-132-A and SCP-ZH-132-B have been sent to the biological research site [[[Site-ZH-44]]] for analysis. Induced amnesia has been imposed on the object&#39;s relatives and the witnesses.

**Description:** SCP-ZH-132 was a collective name for two anomalous humanoid entities, named SCP-ZH-132-A and SCP-ZH-132-B, whose appearance and intelligence levels were close to 8-9 years old human children. SCP-ZH-132 had been dead for some time when first discovered by the Foundation (23.09.2018), and it was noted that both entities had a smoothly cut circular hole through the eyebrow to the back of the head, but there was no other trauma on the bodies or associated weapon found.
@@ @@
SCP-ZH-132 is only known to have a level III [[[clef101|reality bending ability]]], so it is tentatively proposed that the deaths of the two entities may be related to this. Approval has been granted to initiate an investigation into the life activity of both entities.
@@ @@
**Appendix:** The following is an audio recording from the mobile phone of one of the entities (SCP-ZH-132-B), which has been converted into a text file and is suspected to be the last activity of both entities during their lifetime.
