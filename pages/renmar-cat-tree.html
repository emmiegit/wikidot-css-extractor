//{{Renmar is not available for adoption, has already been neutered thank you very much, and refuses any inedible chips.}}//

//{{She has lived in the library far longer than any cat you&#39;ve ever known has been alive, having floated out of a book and into the stacks.}}//

//{{Do not comment on her floofiness. She knows. Please provide some original commentary if you must do any at all.}}//

//{{Approach Renmar only if you are prepared to spend at least half an hour stroking her tail. Any less is an act of extreme disrespect.}}//

//{{Nobody has found her litter box and it&#39;s unwise to try. Too many have been lost to the search already.}}//
