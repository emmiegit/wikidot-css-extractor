**Item #:** SCP-3138

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation personnel embedded in literary and academic circles are to be briefed on SCP-3138; they are to report any fictional work discovered to deviate from its canonical number of human corpses.

A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-MANDELA) is to monitor websites and online communities centered on discussions of printed media; discussions regarding books that describe more human corpses than previously expected are to be flagged for review.

Upon discovery, any printed work of fiction suspected of being affected by SCP-3138 is to be recovered and reviewed by MTF Rho-1 (&#34;The Professors&#34;). Should it prove feasible, all non-canonical corpses are to be extracted, examined, and catalogued. Otherwise, affected works are to be kept on-site in a secure locker. Access is restricted to Level-4 personnel.

**Description:** SCP-3138 is a phenomenon involving the insertion of human corpses into a printed work of published fiction. The work must convey a narrative capable of recognizably describing the presence of a human corpse.

Inserted corpses will be depicted in a manner suited to the work; for example, a corpse inserted into a poem relying upon a particular rhyming scheme will be described via this rhyme scheme. Extraction of inserted corpses can be accomplished by destroying the work or editing it to remove the depiction of a corpse. Should this occur, all erased corpses will immediately emerge from the text in question. Notably, corpses that emerge during these events are non-anomalous, and show signs of decay reminiscent of extended submersion in an acidic environment.

The method by which SCP-3138 is accomplished has yet to be determined.

&gt;&gt; **{{desire to keep my eye on the coach-office. Muttering that I }}**
&gt;&gt; **{{would make the inquiry whether I had time to walk with him, I }}**
&gt;&gt; **{{went into the office, and ascertained from the clerk with the }}**
&gt;&gt; **{{nicest precision and much to the trying of his temper, the }}**
&gt;&gt; **{{earliest moment at which the coach could be expected - which I }}**
&gt;&gt; **{{knew beforehand, quite as well as he. I then rejoined Mr. }}**
&gt;&gt; **{{Wemmick, and affecting to consult my watch and to be surprised }}**
&gt;&gt; **{{by the information I had received, accepted his offer.}}**
&gt;&gt; **{{@@    @@We were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed}}**
&gt;&gt; **{{through the lodge where three smartly dressed corpses were hung}}**
&gt;&gt; **{{hung up on the bare walls, their attire dark and unusual. }}**
&gt;&gt; **{{Though shocked by the barbarity of the sight, Mr. Wemmick }}**
&gt;&gt; **{{shushed me and urged me forward, silencing my confusion with a }}**
&gt;&gt; **{{gesture to his lips. Now, at that time, jails were much }}**

&gt; **NOTE:** Of the three recovered corpses, only one could be positively identified: Vaughn L. Kaminski, an accountant with known ties to Henry Earl J. Wojciechowski[[footnote]]AKA Hymie Weiss; a notorious mob boss active in Chicago during the 1920s.[[/footnote]]. An autopsy concluded that all three corpses died as a result of pulmonary aspiration.

&gt; **NOTE:** Of the six recovered corpses, only four could be positively identified. All were known associates of Alphonse Gabriel Capone[[footnote]]AKA &#39;Scarface&#39;; a notorious mob boss active in Chicago during the 1920s, as well as the co-founder and leader of the Chicago Outfit.[[/footnote]]. An autopsy concluded that all six corpses died as a result of pulmonary aspiration.

&gt; **NOTE:** Although the recovered corpse could not be conclusively identified, it was determined to be that of an adolescent female. In 1932, a missing person report was filed with the Chicago Police Department for Beverly Queen -- a 17 year old female living with Richard Chappell[[footnote]]A co-founder of the [[[chicago-spirit|Chicago Spirit]]], an anomalous criminal organization active in Chicago during the 1920s.[[/footnote]]. An autopsy concluded that the corpse died of pulmonary aspiration.
