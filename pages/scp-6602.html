++++ __Description__:
SCP-6602 represents a series of anomalous events which occurred in and around St. Simeon’s Cemetery and Mausoleum, which is just outside of Friedberg, Germany.

SCP-6602’s anomalous qualities include ontokinetic shifts of local baseline reality, compulsive cognitohazards, atemporal progression of time, and geospatial manipulation.  

**Discovery**:  Foundation agents were alerted to the presence of an anomaly in the vicinity of the graveyard on 25 May, 2021.  Several teenagers from the Dorheim district of Friedberg had announced on social media that they were going to host a party at the graveyard on midnight of 25 May, 2021; none of those who appeared at St. Simeon’s ever returned home.  Local police investigated after several parents made reports of their missing children, but the officers who entered the grounds reported they were unable to navigate through the mausoleum.  No further information was made available, but embedded agents in the //Bundespolizei//[[footnote]]German Federal Police.[[/footnote]] reported the disappearances to command.  

Agents from Site-91 were dispatched to investigate.

//[Agents Delta and Phi enter the mausoleum.  Phi says something to Delta; his lips are visible moving on camera, but no sound is recorded. Delta responds, indicating the agents are communicating.  Despite this, sound is heard on recording, including the footsteps of the agents echoing down the hall.]//

//[Agent Delta stops only a few feet into the mausoleum, standing in front of a stained glass mural on the wall between individual crypt spaces.[[footnote]]Where people are buried above ground in a mausoleum.[[/footnote]]  She points at it and says something to the other agent.]// 

//[Agent Phi examines the surrounding crypts and their brass placards.  The names on the placards are readable when first visible on camera, but then the letters boil away – the surface of the brass bubbles like the surface of boiling water and the letters vanish in what appears to be steam.  Neither agent appears to notice the anomaly, not even when Agent Phi’s fingers are touching the boiling metal.  His fingers smoke and char from the heat, but the agent exhibits no reaction.]//

//[Darkness is all that is visible on the footage for the first fifteen seconds.  Then a faint green illumination grows from off camera until both agents are visible, falling through the air.  A bell is ringing faintly.  Both agents are conscious and flailing as they fall.]//

//[The ringing grows in volume (included below), and the agents’ descent slows until they are deposited to a graveyard which resembles the grounds of St. Simeon’s.]//

//[The bells fade and the green light gradually diminishes, replaced with sunlight and fluorescent fixtures. Agent Phi stares at the stained glass.  Agent Delta places her hand on his shoulder but Phi shrugs himself free.  He turns to the other agent and starts talking animatedly.  He throws his hands in the air and starts towards the exit.  Agent Delta follows behind him.  He turns the corner which should lead to an exit, but finds another hallway of the mausoleum, stretching on for hundreds of meters.[[footnote]]Roughly three times the length of the mausoleum in reality.[[/footnote]]]//

//[Agent Phi kicks a nearby bench.  He turns to see Agent Delta speaking.  She is pointing to the placards.  The names are glowing, the letters rearranging continuously.  Phi touches the nearest nameplate and finally notices his fingertips are burned.  His scream is audible on the recording.  He falls against the crypt spaces, sliding down the wall while cradling his burnt hand.]//

//[Delta kneels before him and extracts a medkit from her pack.  She sprays an antiseptic/anesthetic chemical on Phi’s fingers.  Tears squeeze through Phi’s closed eyes.  The bells begin ringing again.  Delta stands and looks down the hall, her camera picking up movement from the marble of the walls, as the crypt seals begin stretching out.  Her attention is on the end of the hall, which is replaced with green light again shining through the mist which is filling the hall.]//

//[The sound of stone grinding distracts Delta, as she turns to her left and stares at the wall, seeing the marble slabs stretch and part, revealing a new stained glass mural.]//

//[Delta takes a step closer to the mural but is overtaken by the mist and green light.  For approximately one minute, nothing is visible save the light.]//

//[As the light fades, both agents are within a small room made of marble, roughly three meters square.  Delta turns and checks on Phi, who is still cradling his hand and has apparently not noticed their changed surroundings.  A door materializes in one wall of the chamber, also made from marble and two figures enter.  One figure is impossible to identify, as they are an animate silhouette similar to those seen around the open grave.  The other figure is a young girl, appearing to be in her late teens.  The marble floors stretch and take the shape of a table with two seats opposite one another.  The figures take seats.]//

//[The green light rises in intensity until both agents shield their eyes, and the cameras cannot adjust to the luminance.  As the light fades, the chamber has changed again – this time appearing as a small bedroom with a single bed situated under a window.  The girl observed in the previous manifestation sits on the bed, her knees pressed against her chest, her head turned towards the window.  Sobbing can be heard between the peals of the bells.]//

//[On the ceiling is a circular stained glass mural, depicting apparently religious figures.]//

//[The religious figures emerge from the glass, manifest wings reminiscent of depictions of angels, and float down towards the girl. They take turns reaching into the girl’s head and pulling small green motes of light free then returning to the glass.  The sobbing intensifies but otherwise the figure does not react to the angels’ actions.  As the angels continue to pull motes of green light from her head, the girl slowly becomes obscured in shadows until she too is a silhouette.  The last angel pulls a mote from the figure’s head and the light it is holding grows to blinding levels, obscuring the footage.]//

//[The figure drops a bucket – also made of marble – into the well and then hauls it up. The figure looks into the bucket and shakes it. The figure upturns the bucket but it is empty. The bucket is tossed back into the well and hauled out again, and again it is empty. The figure stamps its foot and tries again.]//

//[The small stained glass angels from the previous manifestation peer from around the inside of the lip of the well. Each time the figure draws the bucket back up, the angels tip the vessel so green glowing water flows out. The figure never notices this occurring.]//

The silhouette on the bed begins to scream.]//

The four teenagers who had disappeared at the outset of the investigation are huddled on the floor. One is weeping.

Agents Phi and Delta entered St. Simeon’s grounds at 08:30 and returned at 08:32. The footage recovered from their bodycams shows a timestamp of twenty-nine minutes and fifty-four seconds.

All further attempts to investigate by Foundation personnel resulted in similar manifestations as recorded by Agents Delta and Phi.  Scanning the footage allowed for facial recognition analysis.  Records retrieved for the girl seen during the ontokinetic event match one Anna Müller, born 13 April, 1992 and died only months before the outset of the investigation.

Foundation records note that Müller had witnessed an anomalous event when she was nineteen years old and was administered amnestics, along with her whole family.  Two years later there is another notation stating that she needed a second administration of amnestics due to reemergent memories.  This happened again when she was twenty-four and twenty-eight years old.

The following obituary[[footnote]]Translated from German.[[/footnote]] was found in a local newspaper:

&gt; With heavy hearts, the Müller family regrets to announce the passing of Anna Müller on 6 June, 2021.  She was so very young, and so very loved, but her battle with depression took her too early.  Her dry wit, her passion for art, her generous spirit, and her love for her family will be dearly missed.  
&gt; 
&gt; Funeral services will be held on 10 June, 2021 at St. Simeon’s Cemetery in Friedberg.

Since the initial discovery, the ontokinetic events at the cemetery only occur when Foundation personnel are on the grounds.  Based on these facts, it was deemed acceptable to allow the cemetery to operate as per normal.  Civilians were allowed continued access once reporting police and the four teenagers were amnesticized and released.

Several months after discovery, police reports concerning St. Simeon’s noted two civilian complaints of a “haunting” with the sound of ringing bells and bright green lights within the mausoleum.  The Ethics Committee is currently deliberating whether amnesticization is appropriate.
