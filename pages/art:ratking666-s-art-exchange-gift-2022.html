&gt; I was super excited when I was given the task to create a gift for this years Art Exchange, especially when I was told I would be making it for [[*user Monkeysky]]. When I looked through their author page, I decided I would illustrate [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1163 SCP-1163] as it didn&#39;t have much fanart and it was an article I had a lot of memories seeing when I was younger on the site.

&gt; I am very happy with how the drawing turned out. I wanted to portray the character&#39;s confusion with the world around them, his ability causing havoc that he cannot fully understand because he&#39;s simply way too young, and the Foundation giving him chocolate bars (that&#39;s what the arrows signify, note that they&#39;re set similarly to how the Foundation logo sets their arrows) which was always a funny yet really sad detail to me.

&gt; My plan for the gift originally was that I was going to do two drawings, one of them of SCP-1163 and the other of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/artist-formerly-known-as-chuck The Artist Formerly Known as Chuck]. Sadly, my life was putting a lot of weight on my creativity and I ended up being too low on energy to do the second one. So instead, I decided that when Monkeysky found out it was me who made this, I would tell them that I would also like to illustrate the tale and ask if they&#39;d want to see that. So if you&#39;re reading this Monkeysky, please let me know because I really loved that story and would love to illustrate it sometime.

&gt; With all that being said, I just want to say to Monkeysky that you are a super awesome person to talk to and your art and writing is incredible. I recommend anyone reading this to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/monkeysky-s-author-page check their work out]. If you like anything I&#39;ve created I think you&#39;d enjoy their work as well. Dr. Mario&#39;s orders!
