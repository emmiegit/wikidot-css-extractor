**Item #:** SCP-3116

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Web Crawler LOGOUT-3F-3116 is set to search the internet for references to SCP-3116&#39;s primary anomalous property, as well as reports of hallucinations or somnambulism consistent with SCP-3116-A. Personnel will then isolate the affected accounts, determine all senders and recipients of SCP-3116 to/from that account, and then amnesticize the account operator(s) as necessary. Servers of affected internet services, as well as all computers that may contain SCP-3116, should be searched manually for SCP-3116; SCP-3116 should then be deleted.

A transcription of SCP-3116 itself is attached to this document and can be accessed by personnel with clearance 3/3116 {{[INSUFFICIENT CLEARANCE]}} or higher.

In emergency situations, MTF Omicron-12 (&#34;[[[scp-2842 | Nine-Tailed Dox]]]&#34;) is authorized to use SCP-2726 to temporarily disable hostile actors operating over the internet. In these situations, SCP-3116 should be accompanied by an appropriate antimeme to prevent further spread of SCP-3116.

**Description:** SCP-3116 is a seventy-character alphanumeric string with no apparent linguistic content. When sent as a private/direct message to an account on an internet service, the recipient will be forcibly logged out and their connection to the service in question terminated. Any individuals actively monitoring this event will experience a myoclonic jerk[[footnote]]Comparable to a hypnic jerk, save for the fact that it occurs while awake.[[/footnote]] and the brief sensation of falling as it occurs. No unusual physical or psychological changes have been observed in individuals who receive SCP-3116.

Repeated manual transmission of SCP-3116 can cause a condition (designated SCP-3116-A) in some subjects, characterized by chronic somnambulism and occasional hallucinations. During the REM phase of sleep, individuals subject to SCP-3116-A will attempt to access one or more internet services that they regularly use[[footnote]]This symptom is absent in subjects who do not regularly use internet services.[[/footnote]] and operate them as normal. While subjects display limited awareness of content they access during this state, their ability to interpret and respond to this content in a &#39;normal&#39; fashion is greatly diminished, resulting in unusual behavior.

Those subject to SCP-3116-A will, at a rate of about once per day, visually and aurally hallucinate textually described events as occurring to them or in their immediate vicinity.[[footnote]]For example, a subject reading a review of //Star Wars: The Force Awakens// briefly perceived themselves in the role of the character &#39;Kylo Ren&#39; during a climactic lightsaber duel.[[/footnote]] These hallucinations last for 5-30 seconds and are distinguishable from reality only by contextual information, typically their sudden occurrence and non-sequitur nature.

While no treatment for SCP-3116-A has been identified, symptoms wear off after 2-3 weeks so long as the subject does not transmit SCP-3116. Even a single SCP-3116 transmission can cause an immediate relapse in previously cured subjects.

All tested search algorithms ignore SCP-3116&#39;s presence, negating attempts to automatically detect it or prevent its spread.

**Recovery:** SCP-3116 was first found circulating the internet in June of 2016, by which point an estimated 8,500 accounts had either sent or received SCP-3116. Initial containment efforts were hindered by SCP-3116&#39;s immunity to automated identification and removal, mandating manual identification, interviewing, and amnesticization of all affected subjects; consequently, the population affected by SCP-3116 expanded by an additional ~2,500 individuals before growth could be halted. 

Due to similarities between SCP-3116&#39;s &#39;invisibility&#39; to search algorithms and that exhibited by [[[SCP-2726]]], a connection to Gamers Against Weed was hypothesized early on, and was used to guide early-stage searches for affected subjects. While this link has not been proven conclusively, chat logs uploaded anonymously to a file-sharing site on 2016-09-15 suggest that it was originally produced by the user &#34;gaycopmp4&#34; and distributed among members of the group.

&gt; **bones:** Apparently, some of the repeated &#39;users&#39; of the trick have been joining the chat in their sleep.
&gt; **bones:** In addition to the expected unusual behavior, some have continued to send the trick while in this state.
&gt; **gaycopmp4:** is that why harmpit spendt an hour last night talking about twinkies
&gt; **bones:** No, he later attributed that to an edible. You may recall goodpostskitty logging in on Thursday evening during the &#39;h&#39; debacle; that was her sleepchatting.
&gt; **gaycopmp4:** shit i wondered why she was suddenly horny on main
&gt; **bones:** Regardless, this has only affected members who have used the trick on multiple occasions. Some have also reported hallucinations.
&gt; **bones:** Do you have any idea what might be happening here?
