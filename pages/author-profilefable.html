I go by a few names, but call me Fable! I&#39;m an author specializing in SCP files- namely files that are character driven or character focused in some way. A lot of my writing is also drawn from personal experiences. They say write what you know- so I like to write things inspired by my lived experiences. I&#39;m proud of basically everything I&#39;ve put on site regardless of success. At the end of the day, the act of creating is one to be proud of!

I have a few established characters and settings I&#39;m proud of and use a lot. If you see something about Faraday, Georgia, it&#39;s probably written by me. If you see Agent Basil Sias or my AA Dr. Faran Caraway, that&#39;s probably my work as well! Of course feel free to use my characters and settings in your own works, I consider that super flattering!

* [[[SCP-5828]]] **&#34;As in Life, So in Death&#34;:** Tells the story of an angry ghost and explores how media/popular perception of people can twist a narrative. Deals with themes of emotional manipulation, so be warned in advance. I actually went back and overhauled this one not too long ago. I mostly wanted to make it more in line with my modern writing style, but honestly I was surprised with how little I wanted to change about the article from a fundamental point of view.

* [[[SCP-5829]]] **&#34;The Prophet Hen of Boring&#34;:** I&#39;ve always been a huge fan of Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions, and I really wanted to write an article involving them. While not my strongest work on the site, I do think it&#39;s a nice, short story about a hen with a tough life. I do plan to either rewrite this or turn it into a GoI format someday.

* [[[SCP-5372]]] **&#34;My Gift to You, Oh Love&#34;:** A simple story about a gay couple in the 50&#39;s and the cave that hid their love from the world. It&#39;s a short read, but one of my personal favorite works of mine.

* [[[SCP-5469]]] **&#34;Winnie&#39;s Diner&#34;:** I don&#39;t think I can say anything on this that wasn&#39;t already covered by my author&#39;s comment. My longest work yet and very character focused. This took a long time to write, and I&#39;m extremely proud of the final product.

* [[[SCP-6033]]] **&#34;The Friend With Many Arms&#34;:** A fun romp mixing some of my artwork with a wholesome story involving a boy and his monster. Currently my highest rated work, and I&#39;m beyond grateful for that.

* [[[SCP-6404]]] **&#34;My Name is Your Name and Your Name is My Name&#34;:** My first real &#34;horror&#34; article, and something WAY out of my normal style. I wasn&#39;t planning to hop on the shortform article trend, but I got hit with an idea that&#39;s perfect for it. If you like fridge horror, this one&#39;s for you.

* [[[SCP-6968]]] **&#34;Fantastic Fearsome Critters&#34;:** This is my love letter to good old American folklore. Have you heard of the Jackalope? The Fur Bearing Trout? Well this is me putting them in SCP form, with some deeper commentary on the treatment of animals when money is involved. 

* [[[SCP-6103]]] **&#34;As Stars Fade&#34;:** I&#39;m a believer in writing things that come from a personal place. Personal experiences, fears, memories, etc. are a wonderful source of inspiration and help create works that are sincere and real. That&#39;s what this article is for me, as it draws inspiration from my own family experience with dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s. 

* [[[SCP-6498]]] **&#34;The House of Bones&#34;:** My first contest entry! I wrote this for Nightmarefest 2021 under the &#34;Graveyard Shift&#34; category. A continuation of the Faraday story, we get to see a bit more of Agents Goose and Bluejay as they explore a haunted house alongside Agent Sparrow. Lots of bones in this one.  

* [[[SCP-6059]]] **&#34;HAVE YOU EVER HAD AN ENLIGHTENED EXPERIENCE IN A BALL PIT?&#34;:** My first attempt at a &#34;funnyman&#34; article. This article was a few months in the making, and was a real challenge to get right! I think that the comedy it has works, and it has some of my best dialogue at the time of writing. 

* [[[SCP-6619]]] **&#34;Birthing Pains&#34;:** This is the SCP equivalent of a traumadump for me. It reflects a particularly traumatic experience I had several years ago involving intestinal pain and emergency surgery. Looking back at that experience, I wanted to write something that conveyed exactly what I felt during that process. That became the mpreg body horror story you see today.

* [[[SCP-6621]]] **Los Niños que Comieron Maíz Crudo:** Another DepartmentCon entry for my team. We wound up not qualifying, but I was glad just to have written at all. This was actually my first SCP concept ever, but it went through a massive overhaul during the contest to become what it is now. It is an adaptation of an old, obscure Mayan legend translated into a more modern setting. I&#39;m very proud of it, and hope that you enjoy it!

* [[[SCP-6506]]] **La Muñeca Quitapena:** Working towards my goal of adapting Mesoamerican culture and mythology into the Foundation multiverse, another Mayan legend served as my inspiration here. The Guatemalan Worry Doll, or Muñeca Quitapena, is a small cloth doll that is designed to remove stress and worry as you sleep. Here she is Ixmucane, and she helps Dr. Ash Joydevor as they explore the dreams of a coworker to figure out where her worries come from. I wrote the entire thing in a single sitting, but I am extremely happy with the final product!

]]

**Dr. Faran Caraway:** A site director for a unimportant site dealing in unimportant anomalies. Dr. Caraway is regarded as a &#34;genuinely nice guy&#34;, even with the horns and tail. Still, a man who looks a bit more like a demon than a man is far from unusual in the Foundation&#39;s world. He has a love of plants and animals, and is most commonly seen leaving notes on SCP articles to remind researchers of potentially upsetting content. Don&#39;t let his demonic appearance fool you, he&#39;s a pretty chill guy.

Dr. Caraway is currently seen in [[[SCP-6968]]], as well as [[[Dr. Caraway and Agent Sias Fight Over Pelican Meat]]].

**Agent Basil Sias:** A member of the newly formed Department of Interpersonal Affairs, Agent Basil Sias is the Foundation&#39;s go-to man for anomalies and situations that require sensitive communication. He&#39;s smart and charismatic, and is the kind of person who others open up to quickly. While the Foundation often uses this to their advantage, Agent Sias does seek to form as many legitimate relationships with the people he meets as possible. At the end of the day his goal is to ensure that people are happy and healthy, and he&#39;ll do whatever it takes to achieve that.

Agent Sias is currently seen assisting with [[[SCP-5828]]], [[[SCP-6033]]], and [[[SCP-6103]]]. He&#39;s also seen in [[[Dr. Caraway and Agent Sias Fight Over Pelican Meat]]]. Check them out if you want to see him in action!
