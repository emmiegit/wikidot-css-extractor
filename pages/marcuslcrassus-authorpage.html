[[tab PERSONNEL FILE]]

**Name:** Dr. Marcus Licinius Crassus

**Security Clearance:** Level-4

**Assignment(s):** Humanoid SCP research, manager of Foundation front company &#34;Sasha&#39;s Cleaning Products,&#34; Director of Research and Operations for SCP-5778

**Location:** Switches between Armed Site-21 and Site-42 frequently.

------

**History:** Dr. Crassus was born in ████ in Montego Bay, Jamaica, later legally immigrating to the United States in ████. He joined the United States Army in ████ with a 37F MOS (PSYOPS). He was recruited to the SCP Foundation from the Army in ████ due to existing exposure to the anomalous whilst on deployment and frequent interaction with humanoid anomalies. Whilst under Foundation employment, he earned his doctorates from ████████████ in ████ under special contract with the Foundation, and was promoted to Level 2 following the discovery and acquisition of SCP-████, under his purview.

|caption=Dr. Marcus L. Crassus
]]

Dr. Crassus steadily rose the ranks to achieve the highest rank of Level 4, in part due to his research efforts in humanoid anomalies and his impressive record in the field. He and fellow humanoid researcher, Dr. Jonathan Ward, would be assigned to the Foundation front company &#34;Sasha&#39;s Cleaning Products&#34; in ████. Following an incident in which Dr. Ward terminated a hostile humanoid entity in his own home, Dr. Crassus took part in the tribunal to decide a punishment for Dr. Ward breaking protocol. Most recently, Dr. Crassus took part in the containment efforts for SCP-████, where he worked closely with GOC personnel in order to contain the anomaly.

Personnel are advised to abstain from mentioning anything regarding &#34;Parthia&#34; or molten gold to Dr. Crassus.

------

**Addendum #01:** When asked about the historical significance of his name, or when he was born, Dr. Crassus does not give an answer.

**Addendum #02.A:** //Why exactly is a literal __parrot__ working for us again? Or is it a parrot-man...? Shouldn&#39;t __he__ be among the things he&#39;s researching?// — Researcher A. Wong 

**Addendum #02.B:** //We have had weirder staff before. Get over it.// — O5-7

**Addendum #03:** //I&#39;m not exactly sure what Researcher Wong is talking about. Dr. Crassus is a man.// — Dr. Jonathan Ward

**Addendum #04:** //What I think about Doc Crass? Well, he&#39;s extremely analytical and helpful, godlike patience, will stick out for you if you are on his good side. Good connections, too. Somehow, he knows his way around firearms. He pulls rank a lot, though.// — Agent Colt, MTF Delta-6 (&#34;Instant Action&#34;) CO

**Addendum #05:** █████ ███ █████████[[footnote]] //Who the hell wrote this?// — Dr. Crassus[[/footnote]]

&gt; As you&#39;ll hopefully see, there&#39;s more to the world than meets the eye.

WDDD is my magnum opus, my highest rated thing on the wiki so far (as of writing this), and probably one of the most solid short stories I&#39;ve ever written overall. I think it all comes together very nicely and is short and sweet enough to not require any continuations, but the ending is open-ended enough that I&#39;m working on a part two now. I also enjoy how I used the discord chats as a medium for storytelling, and thought it was interesting enough.

Johnny is an interesting enough character, I&#39;d say, and I modeled a lot of his personality and speech patterns off of myself (including going through my Discord logs and figuring out how I speak.) Clethos was at least partially inspired by an unscrupulous person I met online, most notably in how he uses flowery prose in almost all of his regular speech, so  I&#39;d say I hit the nail on him as a villain. Overall, a very solid story, and one I don&#39;t think I need to rewrite.

My second contribution to the wiki, and another solid one I&#39;d say, but I&#39;m feeling a little weaker on it for a variety of reasons. Still, the wiki was suffering from a drought of GOC content, so I provided with something new.

LTE-1004 was my first foray into more &#34;essay&#34; style writing for the wiki. It took longer for me to write and finish it and it definitely shows. I&#39;m more of a creative writer, so SCP articles and GoI formats with a more clinical/militaristic tone are a bit harder for me to write. Still, I think I did pretty good on it, though the story did drag out a little more. My main critique with this is that it took //way// too long to get to the bread and butter of the story—the combat log—so if I were to rewrite it it would have to be thorough and cut out a lot of unnecessary crap.

LTE-1004 is also my first in a multi-part series of tales and other GoI formats for the GOC, following the escapades and shenanigans of Strike Team 1781 and Assessment Team 711.

&gt; &#34;Once we realize that we can use some of these anomalies to fight fire with fire, that fight becomes a hell of a lot easier, hm? But, in order to do so… the Veil&#39;s gotta be lifted, my friend.&#34;

Partly a case study into the CI&#39;s ideology and my interpretation on it, and partly a means for me to experiment with intros, flowery prose, and dialogue, I feel like this is an underappreciated favorite of mine, despite being my third official contribution to the wiki. It&#39;s also only one part in a series I&#39;m writing of many other Coldest war tales... so there&#39;s still time to vindicate this. Not many people have had anything negative to critique about this, so I guess my niche as a tale writer is showing.

Plus, considering the era... writing about the plight of a former soldier coming back and unable to adapt felt particularly poignant to me, not to mention the fact that he&#39;s black, like me. The story of Agent Jai is one that is fluid and unfinished, so check back soon to see what he&#39;ll be up to.

&gt; &#34;Remember the saying that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line? Think about it...&#34;

This is my first SCP I&#39;ve ever written like, ever, and after thinking that the idea wouldn&#39;t land on the wiki for the longest time, I finally ended up posting it and was pleasantly surprised to see that it actually did well! I had vacation, work, AND the SCP-6000 contest working against me writing this, and I actually had the idea planned out months prior, so this was a long time coming.

I like Lynn, Colt, Spade, and Buck, and want to write them more. They were characters that would&#39;ve been included in my would-be first tale, Perceived Threat, which is still on my sandbox (everyone but Lynn would&#39;ve died.) being concocted. I also liked this anomaly and the GoI I wrote for it being spooky but also vague enough for people to draw their own conclusions. 

Overall, it was a solid first entry for me, and if you&#39;re someone who&#39;s new to my writing, it&#39;s a good idea into my interests and aesthetics. Writing about 90s militaria during one of the heights for conspiracy theories was just too irresistible.

&gt; &#34;I would like to reiterate that the amount of destruction and disarray both Items in tandem can cause is utterly astronomical.&#34;

It&#39;s alright. Sadly, I don&#39;t think this is one of my strongest articles. Yes, it&#39;s a cool concept, I think, and yes it&#39;s a cool Chaos Insurgency format, but it ultimately isn&#39;t as strong as anything else I&#39;ve put out thus far. Maybe I can use this one as a case file for &#34;what went wrong&#34; and &#34;how I can better write&#34;. My awful writer&#39;s block at the time also was //not// helping when writing this.

[[collapsible show=&#34;My thoughts on the SCP Wiki and writing as a whole&#34; hide=&#34;hide&#34;]]This is a bit of a lengthy one. My thoughts on the state of the SCP wiki now, the wiki as a whole, and other things? Well, in short, I think the wiki is great. It&#39;s a great place to learn how to write horror or to expand your creativity, but it might be hard for first time writers to adapt. Still, it&#39;s fun, and the community has been helpful to me every time I&#39;ve asked for a critique or assistance.

In terms of where I&#39;d place myself in the wiki, I think I fill a very specific niche with how I prioritize writing tales &amp; GoI formats over actual SCPs. It’s niche work, and ultimately I’ll be more satisfied if my work gets like 10-20 upvotes versus a massive amount of downvotes like how most first time SCPs written are. I am aware that the standards for writing SCPs now are so mind bogglingly high that most people don’t even get a first SCP up or don’t make it past the drafting phase. That’s why I like tales and GoI formats — you write it how YOU want it to be, and you have a lot more leg room to write with.

Sadly not everything is as popular as SCP articles like I said earlier. However, that’s not to say you should give up—having a mentality where you can look past the 5 upvotes and unpopularity for the sake of improving as a writer/ being proud of your work is a healthy mentality.

Here&#39;s some advice: It’s all just numbers in the end, and improving your skills and confidence is the name of the game. Yes it’s nice to have big numbers, but not everyone is well connected or well known at the start. You’ll still ultimately get people who will enjoy and read your stuff, and that’s what matters to me. It’s not a popularity contest, it’s a horror writing site, and there&#39;s bound to be someone who will enjoy your stuff. Just keep writing and keep doing your thing.

[[tab Personal Overview]]
Thanks for stopping by! My name is Crassus, but you can call me Marcus if you want. I&#39;m a hobbyist short story writer, part-time lab worker, and aviation/STEM student. I also own a parrot, a Double Yellow Headed Amazon parrot named Tiki, who I often read my SCPs to to proofread or gain practice in presenting.

I write collaborative fiction with my friends outside of the SCP wiki and consider this my &#34;side gig&#34;, but I&#39;ve always enjoyed SCP, so much so that I eventually became a writer for it. I got my start in SCP from SCP: Containment Breach and various SCP games on ROBLOX.

Aside from writing, I occasionally make the occasional graphic design project, like military patches or banners or maps. The patches for both Strike Team 1781 and Assessment Team 711 from [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lte-1004-caliburn-velveteen LTE-1004] were made by me.

I enjoy militaria, uniforms, gear, and military stuff in general! My favorite era of history is the mid-late Cold War and 90&#39;s, and I take a particular interest in 80s/90s militaria aesthetics, African history, and retrofuturism. I&#39;m a super big Halo fan, enjoy the occasional mecha anime and, as you probably guessed, enjoy SCP too. I also like firearms, African history and music, rap music, some rock genres, and 80s stuff in general. I&#39;d consider myself to be something like an Afrofuturist even.

As you probably guessed, I&#39;m also a furry. If you&#39;re interested in my furry characters, I have folders of them in my [https://www.furaffinity.net/user/marcuslcrassus/ Furaffinity gallery].

You can find me on my Twitter [https://twitter.com/MarcusL_Crassus @MarcusL_Crassus], where I&#39;m a lot more active. If you need to contact me for any reason, hit me up on there, on discord (Crassus#1776), or wikidot PMs.
