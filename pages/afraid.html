Thank you. For everything.

I am afraid.
After what happened, I&#39;ll never be the same.
I can feel myself fading, leaving everything.
I&#39;ll never be the same.
I am fading.

I am afraid.
Time heals all wounds, but time can&#39;t mend things this broke.
Like sand, I fall through the hands of reality.
Now and forever broke.
I am fading.

I am afraid.
Evaporate into that void which I fear. 
This must be my destiny. To watch myself die.
Scared for eternity.
I am crying.

I am crying.
No one can ever console the mess I am-

[[div style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;]]

&#34;Breaking. Cracking. Failing. Dying.
This is earned. Leave me be. Let me die.
No one can know. No one should help.
... I don&#39;t want to die.

Fearful. Screaming. Crying. Needing.
Need someone. Need support. Send a plea.
No one will care. Always alone.
... I wish someone cared.

The burns. The scars. The pain. The fear.
Glitching out. Disconnect. Not all here.
The world still moves. Yet I stand still.
... Reality fades.&#34;

[[/div]]

&#34;Who are you there?
&#34;I don&#39;t know who you are, but I want to help.
I need to forget my own fate and help them live
I know what you&#39;re feeling.
I am fading.&#34;

&#34;Hold on to me.&#34;
Though I am still scared, I must help them live first.
&#34;If you hold on, I can keep you from fading. Please.&#34;
I can never be saved.
I am fading.

They cannot know.
I need to stay in reality to help.
I can&#39;t show them the demons I hold deep inside.
Stay strong to save them, please.
I am holding.

I am fading.
But they can&#39;t see. I need to stay strong so they-

[[div style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;]]

&#34;Tell me. Let me. I&#39;ll help. I can.
I know fear. I can tell. You need help.
Please let me in. I know you&#39;re scared.
... Just hold on to me&#34;

[[/div]]

I can never.
I can&#39;t watch reality take you away.
I cant let someone I love die because I&#39;m weak.
Find someone else.
Someone not scared.

[[div style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;]]

Never. Ever. Staying. Helping.
You&#39;ve helped me. Let me help. You&#39;ve earned it.
I know the dark. And so do you.
... I&#39;ll never leave you.

[[/div]]

Staying. Caring. Holding. Strongly.
We will stay together.

Troubles. Trials. Problems. Failures
Through the easy and rough.

I care. I hold. I stay. I love.
I love you with no end.

I fear. Dying. Leaving. So scared.
I&#39;ll help keep you afloat.

I&#39;ll hold. I&#39;ll help. I&#39;ll stay. You&#39;ll live.
You help keep me afloat.

The fear. The pain. The tears. We cry.
We are both very scared.

The love. The care. The hope. We hold.
But together, we live.

I leave. I go. You hold. Save me.
If I can keep holding

You leave. You go. I hold. Save you.
If you can keep holding.

We stay. We hold. We breathe. We live.
We can both stop fading.
