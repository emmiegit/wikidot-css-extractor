//Click. Click. Click. Click.//

There was a sense of power in how Officer Calloway’s boots rang out against the silence. Perhaps it was the raw individuality of it, a solo performance — //Jules// was the only source of sound now — or perhaps it was the memories of their schooldays, of sharp-dressed administrators and the heel //clicks// they&#39;d come to match. Whatever the case, they stepped proudly, surveilling the halls and knowing nothing would dare to cross them on a night like this.

Though, judging by the buzz in their pocket, that didn&#39;t mean that no//body// would. Their pacing halted with a //click-ksh// as they checked their notifications.

There was a line an older coworker of theirs had said once. It was nice to have someone worry about you, or... something like that. Except Jules was nearing twenty-eight, and it was all getting to be a bit much.

Besides, it’d been almost a year since anyone had wanted them dead.

Sighing sharply, they jammed their phone back into their pocket and continued on their route. 

//Click. Click. Click.// 

The beam of their flashlight made the frames on the walls shine. Some of these paintings were hundreds of years old, some worn enough to need restoration. On their unluckier nights, Jules had to share their domain with the man who headed up such efforts, Adam Morrows. Fucker got to actually //touch// the paintings — they had to settle for just quietly admiring them. They //click//ed their way over to an empty space at the wall and aimed their torch at the poster that hung there.

Even a photo displayed how cracked the surface was. He was right, the old thing needed fixing. And once he was done, it&#39;d look as perfect as ever. On one hand that was good, because history and culture and preservation very well //did// matter, but on the other it meant Adam wouldn&#39;t be fired any damn time soon. Insufferable prick though he was.

Jules stood for a while in front of the piece, glaring at the figures smiling back at them. At least this job was giving him some trouble. Issues with one of the paint colors being hard to match. They’d tried talking with him about it when he’d first undertaken the project about two weeks prior.

//&#34;What, so you don’t mix some colors and slap &#39;em on?&#34;// they&#39;d jeered, leaning over his shoulder as he took notes.

//&#34;Not quite, no.&#34;// He&#39;d pushed up his stupid magnifiers and smiled at them. //&#34;We have a mastery of several pigments — Egyptian Blue, even, though it was lost for so long — but this one is difficult to emulate. Its rich tones are largely due to its...well, unsavory composition.&#34;//

//&#34;Y&#39;mean...?”// They&#39;d gestured vaguely towards their lower regions.

//&#34;Wh- no, goodness, but perhaps a bit more sinister.&#34;//

Jules thought it over for a moment. Came up blank. //&#34;I’m not followin’.”//

He&#39;d stared at them for a moment, looking like he was trying to calculate an answer... No, not calculate. Tailor. //&#34;Nothing you need to concern yourself with.&#34;//

//&#34;You&#39;re a lil&#39; too quiet for me to not be concerned.&#34;//

//&#34;I&#39;ll just leave it at this...&#34;// He&#39;d stood, looming a few extra inches over them. Something of a sense of superiority, they figured. //&#34;Art and its history are complicated matters. If we tried to measure the past by the ethics of the present, we&#39;d deem everyone a criminal. It&#39;s...best not to judge the old masters, and better to simply appreciate what they gave us. Can you- **do** you understand that?&#34;//

Jules could. Jules did. But it didn&#39;t mean they had to like it.

&#34;I know there&#39;s somethin&#39; up with you,&#34; they told the poster. &#34;I don&#39;t... really know what, but there&#39;s //somethin&#39;.// Spooky shit for a couple of broads.&#34;

If the picture had opinions, it kept them to itself.
[[/div]]

[[div style=&#34;text-indent: 25px;&#34;]]
Jules was a person of many talents. At least, this was what they mused to themself as they circled around the staff area and checked the entry logs. These talents included their security work, of course. The one time someone //had// broken in, he hadn&#39;t stood a chance, and then there was the work back in... hell, they were beating around the bush. Their real talent was extreme patience. So much patience, in fact, that when the log displayed a sign-in from {{Dr. Adam Morrows}} just two hours earlier, they didn&#39;t send the display console hurtling towards the opposite wall.

So much for solitude. They noted down the activity in their logbook and pushed open the door to the restoration space. That saintly patience came into play once more as they caught themself before they flicked on the harsh fluorescent lights, instead just turning up their torch beam and aiming it square at the cloth-covered workstation.

&#34;Protocol says you owe me a heads-up before waltzin&#39; in here.&#34;

The beam glinted off his glasses, tossing shards of light at the wall as he looked up at them. &#34;Apologies, Officer Calloway. I couldn&#39;t sleep a wink. I thought I might get a little extra work done on the Drolling work.&#34;

They scowled. If he could see it, he didn&#39;t react. &#34;Guess I better head out, then. I&#39;d hate to disturb all your high-tech mixin&#39; efforts.&#34;

&#34;Oh, they&#39;re hardly high-tech.&#34; He reached over to adjust the lampshade, letting the bulb cast a faint, warm glow across his face. &#34;You&#39;re welcome to take a look if you&#39;d like. I&#39;ve made some progress mimicking the old pigmentation. Nothing can //quite// match the original, of course, but I believe it should suffice.&#34;

Jules raised an eyebrow, but after a moment&#39;s pause, they crossed the room to join him at the broad table. Secured to its surface was //Interior of a Kitchen//. Now that they were up close and personal with the damned thing, its cracks were all the more apparent. There was some level of poetry in here, they mused. A beautiful piece tarnished with time, cracking to reveal... well, something Morrows obviously knew, but something Jules was still in the dark about.

Those faces were mocking them. They were sure of it.

&#34;Not bad.&#34; They examined where cracks had been carefully sealed and colors had been precisely matched. God only knew what kind of concoctions he&#39;d used to patch up the damn thing. The fume traps — really just large fans — were on full blast, but Jules could still pick up traces of a chemical cocktail. &#34;Still fuckin&#39; creepy, especially with your being on some kicker about the paint comp. But I guess that&#39;s not changin&#39; any time soon.&#34;

&#34;Comp?&#34;

&#34;Composition. It&#39;s, what, 2 AM? I stop bein’ a wordsmith past 12. You want a sonnet, go talk to Bill Shakespeare.&#34;

He stared at them, his expression steadily growing more disturbed. &#34;...//William// Shakespeare.”

&#34;You got it.&#34; Jules stepped back from the table, giving the flashlight a twirl. &#34;See, I know stuff. About... things. I&#39;d know more, y&#39;know, if you weren&#39;t so weird about shit.&#34;

Adam bristled, closing his eyes and taking what Jules felt was an over-exaggerated deep breath. &#34;Is this about the conversation we had the other day?&#34;

&#34;You should try for MENSA.&#34; 

&#34;Look, Jules...&#34; He trailed off, pinching the bridge of his nose and heaving another deep sigh. God, what //was// it with that stance? Seemed like every guy who thought he was something big struck it to make a point. &#34;There&#39;s a lot of complexity behind the history of that painting. Things that horrified artists like Drolling. You wouldn&#39;t believe some of the things people come across in this job.&#34;

They raised an eyebrow. &#34;You work with paint, dude. Past huffin&#39;-induced hallucinations, I doubt you&#39;re going up against much.&#34;

&#34;...Huh.&#34; 

For one long, disturbing moment, he was silent. And Adam wasn&#39;t a man who //did// silence. He did quiet, sure, in that little voice of his that both demanded you respect him and begged you to listen to him, but never silence. And never the blank silence Jules was being met with, calculating, ice-cold.

&#34;Perhaps there //is// just a bit more you should learn, then, Jules.&#34;

&#34;Past shelterin&#39; me? I&#39;m honored. Next you&#39;ll be teachin&#39; me about jaywalking. Or maybe showing me how to shoot off a few rounds, you know, just for self- //hey!//&#34;

But Adam was not listening. Their rant had bought him the time needed to shut off the fume fans, and now there was stark silence, the only sounds being Jules&#39; struggles as he grabbed them by the back of the collar and dipped them towards the surface of the painting. They flung out a hand to catch the edge of the table and keep from plowing into the damn thing, but now their nose was practically touching the still-drying surface. The faces below blurred out of focus as they strained to regain sense. Struggled to regain posture, too, but couldn&#39;t find a weak point behind them, couldn&#39;t pull the collar away from their neck enough to not gasp for air, couldn&#39;t lash out for fear of damaging a priceless artifact.

And in all of this, all Adam offered was one word: &#34;Listen.&#34;

They listened.

But he wasn&#39;t speaking.

He was at least kind enough to ensure they fell //back// when they collapsed.

[[div style=&#34;text-indent: 25px;&#34;]]
At least, above all else, Jules was dutiful.

After the Shit With The Painting, as they had dubbed it, they&#39;d finished their shift and returned home without another word to or from anyone. They&#39;d slept for five hours, gone to the store, straightened up their apartment, and... well, and then just sat back and stared at the ceiling for a while. 

How were you //supposed// to deal with things like this? Contacting the police, probably. At the very least contacting the museum to let them know their restoration specialist was batshit insane. But HR complaints were mounds of paperwork and legal proceedings were time and money, and Jules was exhausted just existing these days. 

So after another nap that afternoon, they did what they always did when times were rough and money was tight: they went to work.

//Click. Click. Click. Click.//

Flashlight. Poster. Hallways. Art. Check-ins. Adam — //No!// Kitchen. Paint. 

//Clear it and move on. Don&#39;t stop to talk. Don&#39;t look where you shouldn&#39;t. Text your mother.//

Although they&#39;d tried convincing themselves several times over that they weren&#39;t concerned for Adam, they couldn&#39;t quite master the lie. Elitist he was, and condescending, but not violent. Never before violent. And if they&#39;d heard those voices at his insistence, he&#39;d heard them too, so they were either really there or they were //both// screwy.

A few nights of pondering these matters prompted Jules to call a therapist. A night awake prompted them to cancel the appointment. Something like this was likely to get them medicated or worse, and mandatory reporting would come back to bite both of them.

Besides, the museum at night was //their// domain, and it was that thought above the rest that kept drawing them back to pace through the halls. Flashlight shining, boots //click//-ing. In the moments where all they thought about was the silence itself and not what lay underneath it, it felt like they were back in control. Jules knew these halls. They knew these paintings. And they knew that if Adam Morrows grabbed them like that again, they were going to have a hell of a lot more than something to say about it.

But every night they felt the urge to return, to listen to what the choir had to tell them and to understand who and what they had been. //When had ghosts become a thing?// Jules had gone urbexing as a kid, having hopped fences to walk through abandoned houses and tag their walls. Even the places that gave the local tough kids a pause barely fazed them. So why, //why// did things have to become real //now//, right when they were trying to put their life back together?

{{&#34;Are you joining us?&#34;}}

A year ago, maybe. They&#39;d been a hotshot young detective assigned to an art theft case that nobody took too seriously. Just another painting to be intercepted on eBay, and the damn thing wasn&#39;t worth that much anyway. The Art Theft Detail had welcomed it as a break after going on a months-long goose chase for a painting that had been in grandma&#39;s closet.

Then people started getting killed.

It&#39;d escalated fast. Jules had been on the online side of things, grabbing details, and intercepting emails. But suddenly they were stumbling across the names and numbers of people working the case, details about their homes and families, all up for grabs for interested parties. They&#39;d done what they could, but soon enough their own name had popped up, and nobody wanted the department rookie&#39;s death on their conscience. They&#39;d been not-so-gently instructed to disappear.

They had. They&#39;d hunkered down in a nice little job below both their pay grade and their skill level and now had to worry about getting choked out in a restoration workshop while a bunch of ghosts ranted at them. Rock bottom was beginning to feel like a fragile surface.

A stinging sensation in their palm dragged Jules out of their sulking. They pried their fingernails from their skin and eased their grip on the flashlight as they approached the screen. No names. No Morrows. //Good//. They cracked open the door, doing a quick once-over with the torch. Coast still seemed clear. They stepped back and pulled the door shut. Continued on their way. All routine these days, everything as quick as possible.

Except... except the issue //was// the routine. They&#39;d been dodging around the room ever since the attack, doing their best to avoid running into Adam. The museum at night was supposed to be their domain, damn it, but here they were tiptoeing around Mr. X. 

It all had to stop. They at least had to //know,// had to figure out what the hell was going on with that painting. And if he wasn&#39;t there, this was as good a time as any.

They took a deep breath and pushed the door open. It all felt like signing in at their old desk, hands trembling as they brought up news of the dead and soon-to-be. Now the dead had spoken, and Jules felt they owed it to them to listen.

//Click. Click. Click. Click-ksh.//

&#34;I mean, he&#39;s a big shot &#39;round these parts. Has a reputation to keep. But why&#39;s that got you worr-?&#34;

A thought flashed through their mind, morbid and vivid, but the very //idea// of it was ridiculous enough to sound like something from a horror movie. They shook their head, doing their best to shrug it off. They had to get it together, focus on what was really going on here.

Jules furrowed their brow. &#34;So you...&#34;

A lesson from training crept back into their mind at the mention of the mummies. They&#39;d been taught to pick up on characteristics of art pieces from different eras, things that would denote authenticity. Stroke styles, signature quirks.

Paint types.

&#34;But... so wait, you ain&#39;t Egyptian?&#34;

Even the voices quieted at the sound of the far door opening.

Jules ran, boots pounding on steady floorboards, flashlight beam swinging wildly. Before Adam could even register their movements they had reached the opposite door, tugging on its handle to escape to freedom.

Found it wouldn&#39;t budge. 

And now, alone with a madman in the dark, that stubborn thought rose to the surface again: there were more people in that painting than the three women it depicted. More, probably, than had even spoken to Jules thus far. 

And they were in the paint.

-----

Jules wiped a sweaty palm on their slacks, adjusting their grip on the flashlight. 

&#34;Was, uh, jammin&#39; the door part of your apology, Adam?&#34; They gave a nervous chuckle, turning to face the interior of the room. &#34;Most people do this kinda thing over coffee.&#34;

In softer lighting, they might&#39;ve been convinced of his side. His smile was small and meek, and he walked slowly. The torch&#39;s sterile beam was unforgiving, though, and Jules could see how much just looked wrong—the smile was paired with dead eyes, and that walk was deliberate. 


&#34;A necessity, I&#39;m afraid. You do have a bit of a... let&#39;s say, //tendency// to run when things get complicated.&#34;

Their nails were beginning to break skin. &#34;Fuck off.&#34;

Adam stopped and held up his palms. &#34;My sincerest apologies for hitting a sore spot, but I do my research on the things that fascinate me. You happen to be one of them.&#34;

&#34;Yeah, your pals said somethin&#39; similar.&#34; They took a few steps to the side, trying to keep him an even distance away. &#34;Told me a bit about themselves, too, actually.

&#34;Your &#39;unsavory composition&#39; was just, y&#39;know, human lives — guess that ain&#39;t much to you. But you talk a lot of shit about preservin&#39; history for someone restorin&#39; a painting created with //ground-up mummies//.&#34;

They expected a reaction from that line. Something, at least, anger or denial, something that made him feel //human.// But he simply shrugged.

&#34;It isn&#39;t as if I can change the past.&#34;

&#34;At least have a little fuckin&#39; //shame// for it, Adam!&#34;

He stepped forward. Jules stiffened.

&#34;And yet //you// have no shame for interfering with my work, Officer Calloway. I would think someone like //you// would understand the inherence of loss in art.&#34;

&#34;The fuck do you-&#34;

&#34;Think about it.&#34; He began to pace. &#34;Art- art //always// requires loss, does it not? Money spent on paints leaving one in the gutter, trying to appeal to the masses to earn their keep. Gorgeous portraits of wartime scenes — and there, there you can even //see// the loss right on the canvas, hm? 

&#34;So what is the next step, Jules?&#34; He turned to face them. &#34;Pouring human emotion, humanity into a painting is the start. Is putting in actual //humans// not the next logical step? Is it not the purest form of love to those we do not know to include them in what we deem beautiful?&#34;

Jules stared at him, eyes wide with shock. It took a moment for them to recover, but once they did, they said the one line they could think of:

//&#34;Bless your fuckin&#39; heart,// Adam, you&#39;re screwier than I thought.&#34;

He smiled broadly, stepping forward to close the gap and putting a hand on their shoulder.

&#34;It&#39;s that Southern charm that draws me to you, Jules, it really is.&#34;

Drawing back with a grimace, they raised their arms to shove him back. But before they could react, they found themself staring up at him, their legs swept out in less than a second. Their head hit the ground with a //crack//. They tasted blood.

&#34;Disappointing, considering your prior training. I suppose even the pros get rusty.&#34;

They spat, rolling over to try and push themself up. But now he had their legs, and they felt a ripping pain through their elbows and hands as they tried to brace against being dragged back. Adam simply hoisted them up like a fallen toy, holding them close, whispering an apology for their struggles. Assuring them the pain would be temporary. 

And then the world tilted sharply, the edge of the table catching Jules in the back of the legs and making them crumple back onto it. The room felt like it was spinning. Their ears were ringing. Their palm, their tongue, God only knew what else was bleeding, and they could barely string together a coherent thought other than //I don&#39;t wanna die.//

They tried to get up. Couldn&#39;t. Could only look around the dark, wide-eyed, and disoriented.

But the room was now mockingly quiet, forcing them to hear their own whimpers and gasps and pleas for Adam to just //stop// this. But there was no response from him now. He was off by his supplies, getting //something//, and even though they had precious seconds there was nothing they could do.

They closed their eyes and willed the world to stop.

And for a brief moment, it felt like it did.

//I don&#39;t wanna die.//

The sheer effort of moving nearly knocked them down again. They grit their teeth against the pain, felt a gasp slip out, heard Adam begin to rush back over. But the torch was theirs, and as they steadied themself on the table, they felt a strange clarity among the chaos.

&#34;Come on, Jules, this is pitiful. You&#39;re only making this harder for us bo-&#34;

They dragged him down and against them, slammed him against the table.

Stared down at his shock.

Wondered which city they&#39;d head to next.

Then slammed the torch against his head until he stopped moving.

//&#34;...Say hi to the old masters for me, Adam,&#34;// they wheezed. //&#34;I think y&#39;all might be in the same place now.&#34;//
-----

The room was silent.

They weren&#39;t sure how much time had passed. An hour? Two? Granted, five minutes could feel like an eternity with a corpse in the room. Whatever the case was, they knew they had time before anyone would arrive on the scene.

In spite of their nerves being shot, in spite of the shaking, Jules felt eerily calm. Deep down they knew they had expected something like this. Had seen it coming from the moment he&#39;d first attacked them. The panic would come later, they were sure, but for now, they embraced the numb tranquility.

They leaned against the table, tilting their head back and closing their eyes. This was borrowed time, borrowed peace. But they had done what they had to do.

Well, except for one thing.

“You sure this is the right place?”

His passenger ceased checking her hair to give a curt nod. 

“…Absolutely sure, Polinski? We harass some random old lady and we’re-“

“[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/your-memory-forever-seen Daniel].” She gave a sideways glance — a warning. “We did research. Many hours. If person inside is older than, hm, thirty? We leave. If not, we ask. And if wrong person, we handle it.”

He sighed, securing the emergency brake with a //click// before exiting the car. Walking around to her side, he opened the door and held a hand out to her.

“After you, Madame.”

“Don&#39;t patronize me.” But she accepted his assistance in exiting, taking care to avoid a stray beer can in her step down from the truck cabin. 

The air smelled of salt, the ocean’s breeze gently rustling their hair and clothes as they entered the gallery. It was a small place near the docks, flanked by a few restaurants and trolley tour kiosks. All in all a nondescript little tourist town on the East Coast.

And if Polinski’s theory was correct, it was the perfect place to disappear.

&#34;Looks like a lot of local art.&#34; Daniel strode over to the far wall, letting out a low whistle at one of the listed prices. “Still pretty steep for what it is.&#34;

“Focus.”

“Right. Sorry.”

A small counter sat towards the back end of the space. Dr. Polinski walked over without a moment&#39;s hesitation, ringing the small silver bell that rested on the outer corner. 

&#34;Be with y&#39;all in a minute!&#34; 

&#34;Alright, thank you.&#34; She looked over to Daniel. Winked. He only sighed.

It was a few moments before anyone stepped through the back door, but when they did, both knew their hunch had been correct. Average height, lean build, androgynous look. And the //freckles.// Dozens of them scattered across their face. Their most distinct trait, judging from the interviews.

You could dye your hair, get a nose job, do any number of things. But some things always stayed the same.

&#34;Good afternoon.&#34; 

&#34;Hey! Can I help you with anythin&#39;?&#34;

&#34;Maybe. Expecting many customers?&#34;

They tilted their head to the side. &#34;Uhh- not really today, nah. Weekends are busier, folks drivin&#39; out here for some beach time. Why?&#34;

&#34;Perfect. Daniel? Wait by entrance, please.&#34; 

&#34;You got it.&#34; 

Polinski placed her hands flat on the counter, meeting the shop owner with a level gaze. &#34;Let&#39;s talk, Jules.&#34;

-----

//Click. Click. Click.// 

As Daniel walked away, Jules was sorely tempted to do the same. But this lady had dropped their name. Seemed to //recognize// them. They could run away, sure, but there was no guarantee that there weren&#39;t more people stationed outside. 

And... well, Jules was content here, plain and simple. They were done running.

&#34;What&#39;s, uh... what&#39;s up?&#34;

&#34;Interesting response.&#34; The woman leaned forward, lowering her voice. &#34;Would you prefer I be more hush-hush about things? I understand you have had some unfortunate situations.&#34;

They sighed. &#34;That&#39;s one way of puttin&#39; it. Look, uh...&#34;

&#34;Doctor Polinski.&#34;

&#34;Yeah, uh-&#34;

&#34;RARE.&#34;

&#34;Pardon?&#34;

&#34;I represent a group called RARE. Recovery And Relocation of Entities.&#34;

Jules raised an eyebrow.

&#34;Name was from group vote. Personally, not a fan. But that is beside the point, no?&#34; She smiled. &#34;Point is, ten months ago in museum, you come across something... unnatural. As did old friend of yours. Though my guess is... by end of exchange, your friendship was over.&#34;

They crossed their arms. &#34;You a cop?&#34;

&#34;Ironic for you to ask. No, I am interested party. Interested in your experiences and keeping them safe. And keeping you in this life of yours. Are //you// interested?&#34;

&#34;...What&#39;s your catch?&#34;

Her cool smile broke down into laughter, ringing through the space of the gallery with a tinny echo. 

&#34;Ah, I //love// when people try to... //co to jest//, &#39;act tough&#39;? Yes? But I have no catches. Only options.&#34;

&#34;If you&#39;re aimin&#39; for blackmail, I ain&#39;t pullin&#39; in much in the off-seasons.&#34;

&#34;Goodness, no. I have offer. That is all.&#34; Dr. Polinski folded her hands. &#34;Either way I help set you up. If possible, I appreciate your assistance. Project of mine. I would compensate.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m not hurtin&#39; anyone.&#34;

&#34;What do you think this is, the mob? No, intelligence.&#34; She took a folder out from her bag and placed it on the counter. &#34;You are aware of unnatural things. I want you to report more of them. Not speak of them to anyone else. You sign agreements, I take you into my employ. Simple.&#34;

Jules blinked, opening the folder and glancing through the documents. NDAs, hiring agreements... and a dossier. They took a moment to flip through their own life story on paper.

&#34;Why me?&#34;

&#34;You are professional. Ideal career, physical combat training. A little more work, you make ideal field agent.&#34; 

&#34;And you ain&#39;t just...fuckin&#39; around with me?&#34;

&#34;Oh, I make point to never &#39;fuck around&#39;.&#34; Polinski patted the documents on the table. &#34;Tell you what. This is... much to consider, I am aware. You take time. Think about things.&#34;

&#34;Alright.&#34;

&#34;And keep them under wraps. I will know if you don&#39;t, and I will turn you in very happily if that is case.&#34; She pushed back from the counter, granting them a nod. &#34;We return in few days. You say yes, we take you on. You say no, we wipe conversation and start over. I do not mean this as threat, but I assume you understand need for precaution.&#34;

Jules glanced down at their palms, still faintly scarred from where their nails had massacred the skin.

&#34;...Yeah. Uh. See you then, I guess.&#34;

&#34;Yes, see you then. Enjoy rest of your day.&#34; She gazed around at the walls, giving the displays a nod of what they could only assume to be approval. &#34;Enjoy the quiet.&#34;

&#34;Oh, trust me. I do.&#34;
