+++ {{**DESCRIPTION** }}
[[/=]]
-----
SCP-7973 is characterized by a systematic reduction in the manifestation of anomalous phenomena. This phenomenon is observed following the complete dissolution of the Veil, a metaphysical barrier that conceals and separates the anomalous from the mundane.

The decline of anomalous phenomena is not limited to the Foundation&#39;s jurisdiction but extends globally, potentially further. Reports from other organizations and independent researchers in the anomalous community corroborate this trend. Verified data suggests that SCP-7973 is affecting all known anomalies, regardless of their origin or nature.

Initial theories suggest that the destruction of the Veil disrupted the underlying metaphysical mechanisms responsible for the sustained existence of anomalous entities. It is hypothesized that the Veil acted as a stabilizing force, maintaining the balance between the anomalous and the non-anomalous. With its removal, anomalous phenomena appear to be returning to a state of equilibrium, aligning with the natural laws governing the universe.

SCP-7973 only affects anomalies discovered or occurring after the Veil is dissipated, as anomalies documented before SCP-7973 remain unaffected. The reasoning behind this is currently unknown. Current models predict the prevalence of new anomalous phenomena will cease entirely by the year 2071.

In order to better understand SCP-7973, and the anomalous at large, Foundation dispatched Doctor Tiana Mark Rosanne to conduct a series of interviews with several anomalous researchers/related personnel. These interviews aimed to acquire additional insights into the nature of anomalies. The following logs contain the transcriptions of said interviews, accompanied by relevant contextual details.

&gt; **Dr. Gears:** Did it not?

&gt; **Dr. Rosanne:** Well, I just have an important question. What do you consider &#34;anomalous&#34;?
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; **Dr. Gears:** Well, to put it simply, I define an anomaly as anything that deviates from our current understanding of the natural world and defies the laws of physics or known scientific principles. Granted, the natural world is surely changing, but I think it still makes sense.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; **Dr. Rosanne:** Alright, got that jotted down. Do you think anomalies are inherently dangerous?
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; **Dr. Gears:** No. Anomalies can certainly pose risks and threats, especially if they are uncontained or poorly understood. However, anomalies themselves are not inherently good or evil, they&#39;re simply anomalous. I have seen anomalies both capable of helping and harming the Foundation.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; **Dr. Rosanne:** Makes sense to me. If this &#34;SCP-7973&#34; does exist, do you think it means anything big?
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; **Dr. Gears:** It&#39;s impossible to say without more data. But in my opinion, it could signify a more troubling issue, such as a fundamental shift in the fabric of reality, although that is just a theory.
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; **Dr. Rosanne:** I see—Once we got more information, I&#39;ll try to remind you! Although you&#39;re leagues above me, so you might know.

&gt; **Dr. Gears:** Understood.

&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**

In the subsequent weeks following the interview, SCP-7973&#39;s influence has exhibited a noticeable escalation. Over a period of seven months, only the subsequent categories of anomalies have been identified:
* 16 instances of humanoid anomalies
* 24 occurrences of anomalous wildlife
* 38 instances of anomalous items
* 41 recorded anomalous events
* 12 designated anomalous locations
* 2 occurrences of anomalies capable of causing a K-Class &#34;End Of the World&#34; Scenario

Due to the dramatic decrease in anomalies, several groups of interest were interviewed in order to understand SCP-7973 further. Certain groups such as Gamers Against Weed and the Church of the Broken God were observed to continue their operations in an unchanged manner. Although most interviews yielded no notable information, the Global Occult Coalition have reported a similar number in decreased anomalies. Below is an interview with Undersecretary General D. C. Al Fine.

Further statistic reports imply a significant downward trend for new anomalies. Contrary to the earlier projection of anomalies persisting until the year 2071, Foundation analysts now anticipate this occurrence to transpire within a considerably shorter time frame, potentially within the next decade. Over the past year, only 3 instances of anomalous humanoids have been documented. In an effort to further understand SCP-7973, Dr. Rosanne has submitted a formal request for an interview with a humanoid anomaly currently under Foundation custody.

&gt; **Dr. Rosanne:** Me? I&#39;m typically the one asking! But—I&#39;m not sure. There&#39;s several times where I thought something was much more than it really was, I was terrified when I was younger on what I didn&#39;t understand. So... that&#39;s why I&#39;m here. Not sure. What about you?

&gt; **O5-13:** Nothing. I don&#39;t really consider anything anomalous at this point. I&#39;ve been a council member for fifty years, and I&#39;ve surely changed. Being forced to work with a talking computer ever since I was in my early 20s might&#39;ve been responsible for that.
