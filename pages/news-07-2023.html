Remember how last month we had two contests? Well, there was another announced, though this one was for the INT branch of the SCP Wiki. This contest, named [[[lorecon2023|The Mighty Lore and Aesthetics Contest]]], aims to take pieces of lore from all over the SCP universe and combine them with aesthetics in order to create a very specific kind of article.

For example, one might get the aesthetic &#39;Byzantine&#39; and the piece of lore &#39;Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions&#39;, which would require the author to write an article with a Byzantine aesthetic in which WWS also plays a major part in. Seems like a challenge, no? But that&#39;s the point of a contest! The posting period hasn&#39;t started yet (it opens on the 10th of July), but if you&#39;d like to see who has what, you can head on over to [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/lorecon2023 the contest&#39;s page on the INT wiki!]

+++ Reviewers&#39; Spotlights

Works are featured on the site’s front page as part of the Reviewers’ Spotlight, which acknowledges the time and effort spent by forum reviewers helping other authors develop and edit and their works for the mainsite. Each month, community members are encouraged to nominate forum reviewers who have been both particularly helpful and active. Members of the Forum Criticism Team will then discuss the nominations, and select four prominent reviewers to choose the month’s Reviewers’ Spotlight front-page features.
