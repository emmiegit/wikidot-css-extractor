= Welcome to...

Â 
= //**GOLDEN MOTH MUSEUM AND R&amp;D**// 

Good day, visitor! Welcome to my museum and R&amp;D. Here at Golden Moth, we value the research andÂ Â preservation of only the highest quality artifac-

What&#39;s that?

The artifacts here aren&#39;t that good?

...

Well you can bugger off then.

----
+++ METAPHYSICS DEPARTMENT

Welcome to our Metaphysics department! It&#39;s a fledgling research department all about, you guessed it, the metaphysical world. 

++++ ARTIFACT #1
+++++ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6043 SCP-6043]

Fun fact, the Golden Moth institution was founded after we discovered this marvelous specimen! We helped discover the mechanisms by which life functions in the metaphysical realm.
----
+++ EGYTPOLOGY DEPARTMENT

Ah! I see you&#39;ve found our Egyptology department! It&#39;s quite small so far but our teams are actively searching for more to put on display. Just across the corridor, to the left of our patented Crocodile Death Pit, you&#39;ll find a cat adoption center. Please do pay it a visit!

++++ ARTIFACT #1
+++++ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6990 SCP-6990]

Our Egyptology research team had a lot of fun finding this one. Ever wondered about ancient aliens? Well, we finally have an explanation for that; this artifact!

----

+++ INTERNET CULTURE AND HISTORY

Welcome to our Internet Culture and History department! Despite it being staffed exclusively by teenaged interns who are payed in &#34;dank memes&#34;, the area is surprisingly clean! Do mind the stray memetic hazard.

++++ ARTIFACT #1
+++++ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5273 SCP-5273]

This artifact was a joint project with the wonderful curator [[*user hungrypossum]]. Surprisingly enough this qualifies as an artifact, by our standards at least! We&#39;ve thoroughly scrubbed any and all memetic hazards from this artifact, so you should be free to look at it without worrying about waking up on a bathroom floor at 3 AM.

----

+++ ENTOMOLOGY

This is our newley opened Entomology Department! Hold your party poppers, you don&#39;t want to startle the insects. Please do read the posters, and just follow me-

No, that&#39;s not a typo. Our guards will beat you with life-sized replicas of various insect wings until you leave if you erroneously use &#34;bug&#34; and &#34;insect&#34; interchangably.

++++ ARTIFACT #1
+++++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6048 SCP-6048]

You wanted a golden moth? You got it baby! This specimen is our largest yet, actually. Now we can officially say we have the largest lamp in town. ðŸ˜Ž

----

Well, that&#39;s the end of this guided tour! I sincerely hope you enjoyed this.

...yes that&#39;s it.

Yes, there&#39;s only 4 departments with 1 artifact each right now. But stay tuned! We&#39;re steali- pardon me, we&#39;re searching for more constantly! Keep checking back here to see what we&#39;ve got.

++++ REVIEWS

Reviews for the Golden Moth Institution have rolled in! Let&#39;s take a look.

&#34;4/5 stars, the museum is great but the staff wouldnâ€™t show me the &#39;golden&#39; &#39;moth&#39;&#34; - [[*user Fishish]]

&#34;1/5 - damn the writings pretty good but i thought this was the golden goth museum. very disappointed&#34; - [[*user SketchyTh0ughts]]

&#34;4.5 stars - Excellent aesthetic here and the curator is a class act. Artifacts are interesting, I&#39;ll tell ya that! Quite...**//valuable//**...as well, hehe!&#34; - [[*user Dr Lerche]]

&#34;0/5 stars, not enough moths&#34; - [[*user Rhineriver]]

&#34;Why do they call it museum of gold moth when you see em the gold moth of out read the muse articles?&#34; - [[*user Boogey_Man23]]

&#34;Where. Is. My. Golden. Moth? I&#39;ve been looking all over the souvenir shop yet nothing. Apart from that, it&#39;s alright. 3/5 stars.&#34; - [[*user winkwonkboi]]

&#34;3.5/5 I was told I would get a real golden moth at the end of the tour but all I got was this rock covered in highly-toxic lead paint. The artifacts were pretty sick though.&#34; - [[*user cwazzycwafter]]

&#34;I&#39;ve seen the golden moth. They showed it to me. This did happen. I did see it. It was beautiful. I&#39;m not lying. I promise it was real. I definitely know that it happened. I&#39;m pretty sure what I saw was the golden moth. 0/5 stars.&#34; - [[*user Deadcanons]]
