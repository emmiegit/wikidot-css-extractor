Some day, they&#39;ll all be immortalised in verse, eh. Enjoy

**&#34;682&#34;**

Big angry lizard
Kind of grumpy, but still fun
Until he eats you

**&#34;447&#34;**

Delicious slime ball
Leaves one feeling minty fresh
No dead bodies, please

**&#34;173&#34;**

If you close your eyes
It will break your fucking neck
Try not to blink, son

**&#34;261&#34;**

Odd vending machine
Every snack a new surprise
Orgasm muffins
    
**&#34;184&#34;**

Where did that thing go
The hallway is different now
Twelve rights and a left

**&#34;262&#34;**

Fashionable coat
Produces arms from within
Gets kind of grabby

**&#34;165&#34;**

resting wall to wall
beware the hungry sand dune
microscopic bugs

**&#34;251&#34;**

Pretty land of snow
Swirling in a crystal ball
Giant spider time

**&#34;177&#34;**

One-player chess game
Black pieces move on their own
And gloat when they win

**&#34;125&#34;**

Hiker passing by
Finds a dragon in the ice
Looks a little shit

-A Fat Ghost

**&#34;297&#34;**

It feels pretty good
Just don&#39;t touch the last setting
Really, don&#39;t do it

**&#34;015&#34;**

Lots and lots of pipes
Miles and miles of it even
Filled with who knows what

**&#34;162&#34;**

Scalpels, needles, saws
Scissors, knives and fishing hooks
This will be painful

**&#34;291&#34;**

Takes people apart
But they&#39;re still okay mostly
In bits and pieces

**&#34;335&#34;**

One hundred and fifty
It&#39;s the whole damn internet
On some little disks

**&#34;335&#34;/lol version**

The whole internet
I just accidentally
Is this dangerous

**&#34;WTF&#34;**

Oh god, what is that
It&#39;s just so fucking freaky
Wat I don&#39;t even

-K.P. Crow

**&#34;882&#34;**
Lots and lots of gears,
Destroys minds and eats metals,
Grind grind grind grind grind

**&#34;055&#34;**
Um... wait... just a bit
I know I had something here
But... damn, I forgot

-SLR

**&#34;973&#34;**

Smokey the bad cop
Kills all lawbreakers dead and 
Says &#34;runfuckerrun&#34;

**&#34;292&#34;**

Roses are Red and
Violets are blue... wait, have I
done this allready?
-Edrobot

**&#34;1333-J&#34;**

Apocalypse man.
Consult a necromancer
or else we&#39;re all fucked

**&#34;10101-J&#34;**

Aw yeah, who&#39;s a man
and a half? I&#39;m 12.0 on
the scale of badness!

**&#34;914&#34;**

Pop it in and close,
Whatever you need improved,
Crank, Clank, Crank, Clank, Ding!
-SnugglyChaos

**&#34;248&#34;**

Paste me if you want,
I promise I will make it
Better than when new!
-SnugglyChaos

**&#34;1463&#34;**

Purple fun for all
Can even purple a ball
Brovisr Funtastic!
-SnugglyChaos

**&#34;1066&#34;**

The pen makes its mark
The student learns instantly
Time marches onwards

**&#34;1231&#34;**

Computer with folks
Try not to think about them
If you do, they&#39;re screwed

**&#34;1000&#34;**

Old civilized apes
They want to fucking kill us
Should we let them in?

-Reject

**&#34;931&#34;**

I don&#39;t understand.
Did I just write in Haiku?
This bowl is trouble.

**&#34;1481&#34;**

Sobbing in his cup.
He wishes for more cocaine.
It didn&#39;t appear.

**&#34;Serpents&#34;**

Gears was gone. She wants...
wanted the answers. But now?
Queen to A5. Check.

**&#34;Wondertainment&#34;**

Crafting joy, madness,
misters, toys, and happiness!
Just while supplies last!

**&#34;Dangerous to View&#34;**

Anonymous us,
Anomalous we made this,
So, are we cool yet?

**&#34;Dear&#34;**

Made you a new one.
What&#39;s lost is lost, but Eric,
come home, we miss you.

**&#34;008&#34;**

Dangerous virus,
well, technically a prion,
and it makes zombies.

**&#34;2406&#34;**

The giant of bronze
Built by MEKHANE, to oppose
The Flesh and Karcists.

**&#34;093&#34;**

Small rock, many worlds
Glass sees in you, hope They don&#39;t
your colour, your hell

**&#34;804&#34;**

Art piece that hates us
Kept in Alaska, why not?
Don&#39;t go near it, please

**&#34;649&#34;**

Matchbox of winter
This is very fucking cold
How does it work though?

**&#34;504&#34;**

Bowl of tomatoes
No horribly bad jokes, please
Pelted otherwise

**&#34;2053&#34;**

Coloured plastic cube
A father longs for his child
Asks, &#34;WHERE IS MY SON&#34;.

**&#34;012&#34;**

Driving you insane
A blood-soaked composition
Music filling graves

Apophenia
allows us to see patterns
even from nothing.

**&#34;1162&#34;**

Stick your hand in it.
&#34;Hey! I found my long-lost toy!&#34;
&#34;Huh? Where&#39;d my badge go?&#34;

**&#34;426&#34;**

I am a toaster.
Anyone who mentions me
uses first-person.

**&#34;3663&#34;**

Crawling in the pipes
The tunnel monster, that&#39;s me
...I didn&#39;t want this.

**&#34;748&#34;**

Through the sobs and screams
Roars a growing Factory
They&#39;re back in business

**&#34;176&#34;**

I dream of living
Longer than seven seconds
Again and again

**&#34;Lloyd&#34;**

We are infinite
And yet, as the world burns down
I am left alone

**&#34;1867&#34;**

I&#39;m so conflicted.
How can I, a gentleman,
be a small sea slug?

**&#34;2085&#34;**

Quintet of cyborgs
Those cyborgs are catgirls too
Wizard says &#34;Fuck you&#34;

**&#34;2030&#34;**

We just wanna laugh!
Don&#39;t you cry, it&#39;s just a prank!
I&#39;m going to hell.

**&#34;Three Moons Initiative&#34;**

In the afterlife
One group wants to save our world
Love, watch, and protect
-

**&#34;000&#34;**

WHAT...What is screaming?
Is it a witch or a ghost?
But Nobody knows.

**&#34;Fine&#34;**

-Etinjat##

**&#34;3774&#34;**

A nervous insect
A sad, lonely janitor
The perfect couple


**&#34;1471&#34;**

An app for lonely people,
A rotting dog like creature,
God damn it Bright not again


**&#34;2935&#34;**

Place devoid of life
Do not let it enter here 
Seal it with concrete


**&#34;096&#34;**

Don&#39;t look at me,
I&#39;m very shy.
If you see my face,
You&#39;re going to die.


**SCP-____-J**

I&#39;ll write this later or something.


**&#34;SCP-001&#34;**

I don&#39;t know my clearance isn&#39;t high enough
[REDACTED], [REDACTED]
And some more [REDACTED] stuff

**&#34;And The Stars Forever Singing&#34;**

Spectrum of dead thought
Through green, pink, blue smoke signals
Five fifths deep below

**&#34;To Those Who Make Music&#34;**

Sing with me, Makers
Let us form a symphony
Against darkness

All he has is a red light.
This one made me cry.

I can’t find the door,
But at least I have meatballs.
The store is now closed.

He&#39;s your new stepdad!
Your mom&#39;s unaware of this.
He won&#39;t go away.
