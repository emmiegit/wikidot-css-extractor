]]
**Item #:** SCP-5003

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The entrance to SCP-5003 has been sealed. 

**Description:** SCP-5003 is a large piece of complex machinery 250m beneath Sublevel 39 of Site-19, capable of generating energy from an unknown source. SCP-5003 consists of three different components: a main power housing, a central control hub, and a vast tunnel system expanding from the control center. 

The central control hub lies within a cavern located approximately 36km from the entrance with walls lined with wires and cables from the main power housing. Additionally, the cavern contains the following:

* A control panel
* Chairs
* A whiteboard
* Fluorescent lights
* Four large scorch marks across the eastern and northern walls

The main power housing is presumed to be located in a chamber[[footnote]] Discovered using the exploration team&#39;s radar devices. [[/footnote]] adjacent to the central control hub, since all cables in SCP-5003 have been traced back to that area. Initial attempts to locate an entrance to this chamber have failed. Therefore, there is no conclusive evidence that this is the power source of SCP-5003. The title &#34;main power housing&#34; has been given to the chamber for clearer communication.  

The tunnel system is largely unexplored. Initial reconnaissance discovered that they are lit by fluorescent lights and lined with cables that are connected to the main power housing.

The only known entrance to SCP-5003 is through a metal door located in the service tunnels on Sublevel 39 of Site-19. Inspection of the Site-19 blueprints indicated that these tunnels were never originally meant to be part of the site&#39;s construction. 

--Testing to identify further effects of SCP-5003 is still underway.--

**Discovery:** On 06/21/2014 Site-19 sensors picked up a spike in electromagnetic activity underneath the site. Searches of the lower levels of the site located the doorway to SCP-5003, which was open at time of discovery. 

**SCP-5003 Testing Operation:** After the initial discovery of SCP-5003, Dr. Raven Koullette proposed a series of experiments to be run on SCP-5003 to determine the functionality of the control panel, and if the anomaly requires additional containment protocols. These experiments were to be carried out by a team consisting of Researcher Thomas DeWalt[[footnote]]A trained D-Class handler.[[/footnote]], and D-3481[[footnote]] Picked for their record of good behavior.[[/footnote]] to act as a subject and assistant. Since the travel time from the entrance to the control center is approximately 7 hours, DeWalt and D-3481 were equipped with three days worth of water and rations, sleeping bags, flashlights and a standard-issue Foundation Fieldwork Radio to communicate test results back to Dr. Koullette. Testing was scheduled to take place over the course of two days.

&gt; 
&gt; //Recording begins. There is a light humming noise in the background.//
&gt; 
&gt; **DeWalt:** Raven, can you hear us?
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Loud and clear Thomas. I assume you&#39;re ready to start testing?
&gt; 
&gt; **DeWalt:** Wouldn&#39;t have contacted you any earlier. Ready Charles?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** I guess.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Alright, let&#39;s get this show on the road.
&gt; 
&gt; **DeWalt:** Charles, can you flip switch 1-A?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Umm... which one is that? 
&gt; 
&gt; **DeWalt:** It&#39;s the blue one over on your left.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Oh. Ok.
&gt; 
&gt; //The humming stops. A scream is heard, followed by a repeated crackling noise. After a few moments the humming returns.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** What happened? Are you ok?
&gt; 
&gt; //Silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Thomas?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** I— I&#39;m still here.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-3481 is breathing erratically.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** What happened?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** I flipped the switch and lightning came out of the control panel and hit Thomas and now he&#39;s not moving and I don&#39;t know what to do. I didn&#39;t mean to I swear! It just missed me and, and—
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Deep breaths. I need you to breathe. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Right... deep breaths. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Is Thomas alive?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** I think so. He&#39;s looking at me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** I&#39;m deploying a medical team down there at once. Did anything else happen?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Umm... the lights. The lights in one of the tunnels went out.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Which tunnel?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** The one we entered through? I think? They all look the same. I don&#39;t know.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** 3481, I need you to calm down. We&#39;re coming to get you and Thomas right now. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** How long?
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Approximately eight hours.
&gt;  
&gt; **D-3481:** Ok... ok. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Please relay that to Thomas.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Ok.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** And remember, deep breaths.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;**End Log**&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Hey, 3481, are you still there? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Yeah. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** I have an update on the medical team. They reached the entrance to the tunnels.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** That&#39;s good to hear.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Well... there&#39;s a problem. The door is shut. We&#39;re trying to figure out how to open it safely.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** It&#39;s closed?
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Yeah. Unfortunately, since we&#39;re working in the lower levels of the facility, we&#39;re limited in our options. We can&#39;t just blow up all of sub-level 39.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** So, we&#39;re trapped?
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** We&#39;re going to get you out, but I don&#39;t know how long. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** We&#39;re trapped...
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** I know I&#39;ve been telling you this a lot, but deep breaths. I need you to stay with me on this.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Ok. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** In Thomas&#39; pack there should be a binder full of testing information. Can you find that for me?
&gt; 
&gt; //Scuffling noises are heard.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Ok. Found it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** I need you to read through all of that. We may need you to continue testing. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Yes. You. And don&#39;t forget to ration out your food. We shouldn&#39;t take too long but, just in case.

&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** I um... I haven&#39;t started yet.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Yeah. Yeah we ate. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Everything else going ok?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Not really. Couldn&#39;t sleep last night.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Any reason why?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about the tunnel where the lights went out.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** That sounds... rough.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Would you like to know how much oxygen you probably have?
&gt;

&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** I&#39;m from Colorado.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** I&#39;ve been there before. It&#39;s nice. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Yeah. Yeah it is. A lot of open space. Mountains are pretty.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Blue sky.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Yeah. Blue sky.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** If you&#39;re able to help me out, I promise you, you&#39;ll see that sky again. But I need you to be calm, and with me. Understand?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** I... I understand.

&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Oh?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** He&#39;s been looking down the tunnel that has no lights. Just... just staring. It&#39;s so dark down there. I&#39;ve moved to the other side of the room so he&#39;s further away from it, but I don&#39;t think that helped. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Well, tell him we&#39;re coming. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** I will.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** I felt something like a cold breeze coming from the tunnel where the lights went out. I don&#39;t know why I thought I might find something down there but I did. There&#39;s berry bushes growing out of the walls.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Berry bushes? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Yeah. Blueberries, raspberries, blackberries.

&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** They weren&#39;t there before.

&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** They look normal.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Ok. Well, more food is a good thing I guess. It&#39;ll probably be easier to feed Thomas the berries than the rations.

&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Raven, I need to know what it&#39;s going to do!
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** That&#39;s... that&#39;s classified.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Fuck. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Deep breaths Charles. I need you to take deep breaths and trust me. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** ... there&#39;s so many bats.

&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Charles, you there?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Yeah.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** How&#39;s Thomas? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** He&#39;s holding it together.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Still looking at the tunnel?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** ... yeah? He&#39;s calmed down some, I think. Gotten used to the cave.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Oh, he has?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** His gaze looks more relaxed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Yeah. Relaxed sounds right.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Umm, any other questions?
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Just one more, how much water do you have left?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Oh, um... Not much. We effectively ran out yesterday.
&gt;  
&gt; **Koullette:** Yesterday? 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Yeah.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** You remember when I told you how much oxygen you had left?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** I remember. It really helped me soothe my—
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Do you want me to tell you how much water we sent you with?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** ... No.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Charles, just— goddamn it Charles.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** It&#39;s not like he would&#39;ve made it anyways!
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Did you even try to feed him?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:**  You were supposed to be down here two days ago!
&gt; 
&gt; //Koullette falls silent.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** There&#39;s been complications.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Bullshit.
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** You know what would get us down here? If you just finished your tests and hit that button!
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Really? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Do you think I&#39;m fucking with you?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** I don&#39;t know!
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Well, you&#39;ll never know if you don&#39;t hit the button! Goddamn it... it&#39;s not that much to ask.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** That&#39;s easy for you to say!
&gt; 
&gt; **Koullette:** Fine. I&#39;ll say something else then. We&#39;re leaving you down there until you hit that fucking button. Understand 3481?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** You were never coming for me, were you?

&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Hey... Raven? You there? Anyone?
&gt; 
&gt; //Radio silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** Ok. I guess it&#39;s just me then. Or maybe it&#39;s late up there. I don&#39;t know what time it is anymore. I&#39;ve been trying to keep myself awake because well... I&#39;ve been feeling more and more tired. I&#39;m scared that the next time I go to sleep, I won&#39;t wake up.
&gt; 
&gt; //Sniffling.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** So, yeah. It&#39;s just me, a corpse, and the power source. I&#39;ve been thinking about that emergency button. I know you want me to hit it. It&#39;s probably an emergency off button. Turns off the power source, and the heat, and the lights. I don&#39;t know why you want this thing turned off. Maybe it&#39;s something happening up there. It&#39;s probably classified anyways. 
&gt; 
&gt; //D-3481 takes a deep breath, and then laughs quietly.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** I&#39;m still doing that thing you told me, Raven. Deep breaths. They got me through a lot down here. I was starting to umm... I was looking forward to getting out. That&#39;s pretty cruel, don&#39;t you think, Raven? You gave me hope for so long. I believed you. I thought I was going to see the sky again.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-3481 pauses.// 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3481:** I think... I think I&#39;m going to leave it on. At the end of the day, I&#39;m just a scared man. I&#39;m afraid of the tunnels, the bats, the control panel. I know I told you already, but during that first night I was even afraid of the dark. I still am. I don&#39;t know what would happen to me in the blackness. So... yeah. That&#39;s all I have. I&#39;m going to leave the lights on.
