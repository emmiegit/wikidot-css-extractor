##indigo|As part of anomaly research, you may find yourself in need of significant additional funds, large numbers of personnel, or other high-intensity resources. The Foundation does have expansive resources, but our reserves are not infinite. To ensure proper resource allocation, researchers submit proposals for different levels of Foundation Grants. The main levels of grants are the following:##


||~ ##indigo|Grant Leve##l ||~ ##indigo|Grant Type## ||~ ##indigo|Grant Purpose## ||~ ##indigo|Frequency of Award## ||
|| ##indigo|Dod##o || ##indigo|Monetary Only## || ##indigo|Purchase of materials not currently in Foundation possession## || ##indigo|100 per week## ||
|| ##indigo|Sea Cow## || ##indigo|Computer Clusters## || ##indigo| Comprehensive web scouring, machine learning training## || ##indigo|3 per site per week.## ||
|| ##indigo|Mastodon## || ##indigo|Monetary, Personnel## || ##indigo|Large scale exploration missions## || ##indigo|Once per week per site.## ||
|| ##indigo|Sabre-Tooth##||##indigo| Personnel Only## || ##indigo|Highly dangerous field missions## || ##indigo|20 per week## ||

The following documents were submitted by Dr. Teller as part of a bid for a Mastodon-Level containment mission grant.

&gt; __Rainbow Duality Theory__
&gt; 
&gt; //Abstract//
&gt; 
&gt; In //Reaching the End of a Rainbow: A Theory on Optical Convergence// (Teller et. al. 2022)[[footnote]]##indigo|While spelling and grammar are less important in internal documents, The Foundation is still conscious of plagiarism and proper citations.##[[/footnote]], we proposed the existence of a physical and reachable terminus of a rainbow based upon collective observational convergence.  This paper seeks to extend this theory to another aspect of this common optical illusion.
&gt; 
&gt; When light enters a raindrop, it will reflect off the interior of the drop, separating the light into the beams seen. However, at certain angles, light entering a water drop will reflect twice, instead of once. In the correct conditions, this creates the double rainbow phenomenon.
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, all rainbows are technically accompanied by a secondary rainbow. The double rainbow phenomenon is only considered distinct from the traditional single rainbow because, often times the secondary rainbow is too faint to see.
&gt; 
&gt; I posit that, the anomalous activity that is related to SCP-7000 originates not from the terminus of the primary rainbow, but from the terminus of the secondary rainbow. 
&gt; 
&gt; This paper will demonstrate this claim through three vectors:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Meteorological analysis of past SCP-7000 instances reveal that they only occur in cases where a secondary rainbow is visible.
&gt; 2. The terminus of these secondary rainbows aligns with the locations of individuals who have been affected by SCP-7000.
&gt; 3. The phenomenon experienced by both field team that have committed excursions to primary rainbow termini have not aligned with the testimonials of SCP-7000 affected individuals.

&gt; __Mastodon-Level Grant Proposal: Return To Rainbow&#39;s End__
&gt; 
&gt; Recent developments in the SCP-7000 project have indicated that our initial field excursion to the rainbow terminus was not properly representative of SCP-7000 instances, as experienced from the field members did not align with eye witness testimony. 
&gt; 
&gt; Historically, there is cause to believe that SCP-7000 events did occur at the primary rainbow terminus: this being due to the existence of pre-built structures. It is conjectured that these structures either belonged to entities residing within the terminus, or to colonial-era anomalous trappers. In either case, whatever activity was once performed at the primary rainbow terminus, no longer occurs there. It follows that, if SCP-7000 events occur at the secondary terminus instead. It is additionally conjectured that these two locations are connected via the unexplored tunnels. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thus, the goals of this mission are threefold:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Rescuing Operations Specialist Casey Vivera (lost during original field mission)
&gt; 2. Documenting the terminus of a secondary rainbow
&gt; 3. Record the events of a proper SCP-7000 instance 
&gt; 
&gt; Using resources from a Mastodon Level grant, we can utilize cloud seeding and power light sources to artificially instantiate a rainbow. With sufficient numbers of personnel observing said rainbow, we can also create a stable convergence point to ensure the safety of the exploration team.
&gt; 
&gt; By acting on this as a Mastodon Level grant, we can rapidly expand our knowledge of SCP-7000, as well as possibly save Casey Vivera, who has been stranded for more than 30 days.

**SCP-7000 Affected Persons Follow-Up:** Below is an abridged list of the updated situations of SCP-7000 affected persons.


||~ Name ||~ Previous Situation ||~ Update ||
|| Leon Moulin || Commercial success after public toxic relationship self-help book. || Foray into writing fiction is poorly received. Publishers refuse additional self-help manuscripts. ||
|| Sandra Bodera || Successfully opened Michelin star awarded restaurant || Failed a health inspection after mold was found in the kitchen. Restaurant was subsequently closed before Bodera could turn a profit. ||
|| Wu Hsin-Kai || Inducted as IEEE fellow after publishing seminal paper on VR disorientation. || A research team from the India Institute of Science (Bangalore) claims Hsin-Kai plagiarized their work. While Hsin-Kai claims that this paper was not accessible to them during their literature search, they are still stripped of their IEEE fellowship and professorship offers. ||

**Weekly Mentor Check-in #6**

&gt; **Mackey:** Ok, so I was joking when I said forty five pages on my desk... I was not expecting you to get a Mastodon grant within a week.
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:** Well, um, we couldn&#39;t wait too much longer, Right?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mackey:** No. No we could not. I assume you want to use the same team from the field mission? You know, to maximize your luck and all that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:**  Actually... I&#39;ve been uh, like— I&#39;ve been going back and forth on that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mackey:** Oh? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:** It&#39;s just that— while I was waiting for the grant review committee, I uh, I did some follow-up research on the SCP-7000 victims we had on file.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mackey:** You really never slow down, do you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:** ... and I found that all of them were struggling. Either financially or romantically or physically— none of them were doing well.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mackey:** That&#39;s unfortunate to hear. I guess even magically conferred luck doesn&#39;t last forever.
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:** Yeah. That&#39;s— that&#39;s what I&#39;m worried about.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mackey:** Oh, right.
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:** It&#39;s been more than a month since the field mission. I don&#39;t know how long this stuff lasts! I haven&#39;t had time to do those tests... what if everything runs out while we&#39;re in the terminus? I&#39;m not a field specialist! I don&#39;t have half the training for these sorts of missions. I was thinking that during our first outing but everything seemed to be going so well and I didn&#39;t even question how out of my depth I was and—
&gt; 
&gt; **Mackey:** William, stop it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:** ... sorry. Just nervous is all I guess.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mackey:** You&#39;re not the only one going on this mission. You got me, Norm, and Pablo. They&#39;ve been doing field work for a combined eleven years, and I&#39;ve been working with anomalies myself for fifteen. We&#39;ve dealt with a lot more than a little bad luck.
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:** But last time—
&gt; 
&gt; **Mackey:** Last time we didn&#39;t know half as much as we do now. Even if your luck goes down the drain, you&#39;ve armed us with enough knowledge to make up for it. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Teller:** Right... thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mackey:** No problem, kid. Now let&#39;s go grab us a pot of metaphorical gold.
