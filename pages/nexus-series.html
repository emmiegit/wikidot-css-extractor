+ [[span style=&#34;font-family: Verdana; font-size: 105%;&#34;]]##black|**What Is A Nexus?**##[[/span]]

^^[[size 130%]]//Never even heard of it before...//[[/size]]^^

A Nexus (plural: Nexuses[[footnote]]For those of you who think it&#39;s Nexii, please see the discussion thread[[/footnote]]) is an area/zone that is actively anomalous, and supports a permanent community. Imagine a city like New York, except that perhaps the city never sees the Sun, or people sometimes turn into animals, and that&#39;s perfectly normal for them.

Normally, the Foundation/GoI would classify these places as SCPs and try to get everyone out and lock the place down. Unfortunately, sometimes that isn&#39;t always possible or feasible. Hence, they designate those places as a Nexus. This means that these areas are recognised as places of anomalous activity and left be, albeit under supervision from a GoI or government. They are also hidden from the public, and all evidence of its existence hidden.

There are also larger versions of Nexuses, known as Free Ports. These area are inherently anomalous, often being disconnected from the main world. They act as safe zones where the Veil is not required, as everyone who enters a Free Port, knows about the anomalous. Free Ports are usually recognised as sovereign states and are self-managed, albeit with some intervention from federal or international agencies.

Additional [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/nexus-series| Locations of Interest]]] from around the world are listed on the International Translation Archive.

@@@@
^^[[size 130%]]//The foundations of an idea//[[/size]]^^

[[size 150%]]**Low Population**[[/size]]
Most Nexuses have very low population numbers, with the highest being 30,000[[footnote]]An exception would be Nx-03, Hy-Brasil with a former population of just over a 100,000[[/footnote]]. A large population would often mean news of the Nexus would be spread around much more. It&#39;s also an added bonus to the Foundation, which helps them maintain the Veil easily.

[[size 150%]]**Nexus Confines**[[/size]]
A Nexus&#39;s anomalies only occur within the confines of the Nexus (or in certain cases, other Nexuses). For example, you couldn&#39;t force the Goatman from Sloth&#39;s Pit to exit the confines of the Nexus: the act would simply make him a normal goat after a while. What happens in the Nexus, stays in the Nexus.

[[size 150%]]**Thematic Influence**[[/size]]
Each Nexus has its central theme that encompasses the entire idea of the anomaly in the Nexus. They can exist anywhere in the world, so long as they have around ~25 people at least, and should not match the any real-world location. Besides that, you&#39;re free to do whatever you want. If you want a Nexus that rains salmon, go ahead[[footnote]]Someone&#39;s already done that idea, unfortunately[[/footnote]].

[[size 130%]]**##blue|Briar##**[[/size]]
Name derived from the old Briar Patch from Song of the South. A few local curiosities, higher frequency for extranormal events and anomalous objects. Requires little to no cover-up by the Foundation.
@@@@
[[size 130%]]**##green|Asphodel##**[[/size]]
Name derived from the Fields of Asphodel, the incredibly mediocre afterlife in Greek Mythology. Civilians will get the feeling that something&#39;s off about this place, higher frequency for extranormal events and anomalous objects. Requires some cover-up by the Foundation.
@@@@
[[size 130%]]**##FFDD00|Camelot##**[[/size]]
Name derived from the King Arthur Legends. Anomalous activity is a fairly integral part of the town. Foundation has to perform cover-ups regularly, as well as make it a bit more difficult for civilians to find by taking it off maps and such. Containment Facilities may be needed on a case-by-case basis.
@@@@
[[size 130%]]**##orange|Shangri-La##**[[/size]]
Name derived from James Hilton&#39;s Lost Horizon novel. Hotbed of anomalous activity. Active attempts to stop civilians. The Foundation rolls with the anomalous as it comes. Containment facility required.
@@@@
[[size 130%]]**##red|Dunwich##**[[/size]]
Thank you H.P. Lovecraft. The entire place is practically anomalous. The Nexus is almost entirely cut off from the non-anomalous world. Special measures may be required to keep personnel safe. Containment facility required.
@@@@
[[size 130%]]**##purple|Free Port##**[[/size]]
Anomalous hubs of commerce and living. These communities are openly aware of the anomalous and actively practice it. These hubs are protected by national/international law, and forbid Foundation intervention. Policing of the Nexus is done though its own agencies. These Nexuses can only be accessed through anomalous means[[footnote]]Think Diagon Alley from Harry Potter. [[/footnote]].

//A vast extradimensional library, allegedly containing all knowledge ever written down. Although the Foundation has been aware of the Library since 1955, it has existed for much longer than that. The Library serves as the base of operations for GoI-014, the [[[serpent-s-hand-hub|Serpent&#39;s Hand]]], but various inhuman entities known as Librarians are the ones that actually maintain and protect the Nexus. Individuals that harm the Library, its books or its patrons are punished by being transformed into Librarians to work off their debt. This fate has befallen a number of Foundation personnel and [[[goc-hub-page|GOC]]] operatives during incursions into the Library, and so the Foundation has adopted a more diplomatic approach to this specific location.//

These rodents rely on their skill at biothaumaturgy and paraminerology for survival. Site-14 maintains a diplomatic relationship with these non-human inhabitants of the Nexus, prevents exploration by other groups, and cooperates to contain entities found deeper within the Abyss.

Rumors of a witch inhabiting the forest also plague the city&#39;s populace as they mourn over their lost children.

**Description:** //A small area of the Cascade Mountain range with a significantly high volume of illusory flora and fauna.

**Description:** //Eventide is a city in Oregon that never sees the Sun, due to an unknown impermeable object blocking the sky.

Due to the control exerted by the Bavarian Illuminati[[footnote]] A member of the GOC&#39;s Council of 108[[/footnote]] upon the city, the Foundation must operate as a black-ops unit to gain control of the city.//

**Description:** //Nx-56 was Summerstone, a Welsh logging town surrounding a temperate rain forest. Originally the host of a semi-stable SCP-4886-A ecosystem, the events of Incident 4886-AO forced the Foundation to reevaluate the extent of Nx-56&#39;s anomalous properties.

**Area Class:** ##blue|**Briar**##

**Description:** //Nx-94 designates not a single contiguous area, but instead a series of First Nations reservations along the coast of Lake Huron where culturally-specific anomalous occurrences are common. As these occurrences typically only involve members of the related cultures, and as local populations are low, only nominal monitoring activities organized at Site-43 have been necessary thus far. Indigenous peoples carrying out their traditional rituals have successfully propitiated nearly all mythological beings within the Nexus, making their actual containment a non-issue.//
