    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>+ 그래서 작품교환이 뭐죠?
작품교환이란 크리스마스/연말연시 기간 동안 위키의 예술가와 작가들이 멋진 선물을 주고 받을 기회입니다. 참가자들은 일반적인 종류의 받고 싶은 선물, 예를 들어 일러스트, 이야기, 음성, 시 같은 것을 표시하고, 받고 싶은 선물도 표시합니다. &#34;내 작품과 연관된 것&#34;같이 포괄적일 수도, &#34;왁스애플과 SCP-106이 나오는 SF 이야기&#34;처럼 구체적일 수도 있습니다.

여러분은 그리고 무언가를 만들어서 줄 사람을 배정 받습니다. 비밀 산타 스타일이죠. 그리고 선물을 제출하고 차례대로 선물을 받습니다. 바로 크리스마스 직전에요. 며칠 뒤, 주최자가 누가 선물을 만들었는지 공개합니다.

+ 왜 작품교환이 멋지죠?
우선, 커뮤니티의 멤버들, 나이가 많던 적던, 서로 모여 멋진 선물을 나누는 건, 그자체로 멋진 일입니다. 둘째로, 사람들은 자주 전력을 다합니다. 저흰 앰비언트 앨범과 완벽한 RPG 스플랫북, 비디오게임을 가지고 있고 모두 다른 유저의 휴일의 소원에 따라 만들어졌습니다. 셋째로, 사람들이 쓴 것들의 일부는 결국 사이트에 올라가, 일반적으로 멋진 풍부함과 풍부한 멋짐을 위키에 더해줍니다.

+ 이 페이지 용도는 뭐죠?
이전 교환에서 사람들이 사이트에 올린 것들을 지속적으로 추적하기 위해서입니다. 또한 이전 교환을 간단하게 찾을 수도 있죠. 사이트에 올라온 모든 작품뿐 아니라, 여러가지 이유로 궁극적으로 올라오지 못한 수많은 놀라운 그림, 음악, 글, 낭송들도 있습니다. 따라서 아래에 링크된 작품만 아니라, 스레드도 살펴보세요. 그리고 만약 당신이 교환에서 준 것을 바탕으로 작품을 올렸다면, 자유롭게 추가하시고 &#34;//[http://ko.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/작품교환#pages 작품교환]//.&#34; 태그를 붙여주세요.

Ah. You are awake.

&#34;{{@@  @@}}&#34; 

It is me. 

&#34;{{@@  @@}}&#34; 

But of course, this is quite the change is it not?

&#34;{{@@  @@}}&#34; 

Try to think. Do you remember when we first met?


You were but a child, practically a sapling. You had come to me, bruised and bloodied, a victim seeking shelter. You found refuge in this quiet place I call home. The other boys had seen fit to harass and attack you. First they hurled insults, then stones. I thought this strange. Could they not see you as I did? Could they not experience how pure, how gentle you truly were? Did they think you deserved their cruelty?

You soon returned, and many times after that, a creature of habit. I became your sole friend, your confidant. You would tell me of the world beyond my purview. You would tell me about how you were shunned and neglected by your family, teased time and again by the other children, made to feel like you did not belong. Through it all, you persevered, without an ounce of malice in your heart. Incorruptible.

Oh, how swiftly you sprouted! And in your twelfth year we would be joined by another, a girl. She saw you in much in the same way that I did. She saw beyond your faults. She saw into your soul. She found it to be full of hope and wonder and optimism. I marveled at her patience and understanding. You were perfect for each other.

The two of you would steal away from the world, to your special spot. The one place you could be free. You would meet after your chores and her schooling. You would clamber up my side, onto my sturdiest bough and watch the sun set together. I watched as love blossomed between you across the years. I was certain you were destined to be together. You deserved that much.

You grew into a fine young man, and found employ with your beloved&#39;s father. You worked so hard, and without respite. Such conviction! You endeavored to prove your worth. You would show him that you were right for her, that you were dependable. When the time finally came, you asked her father for her hand in marriage. He scoffed and called you a half-wit. He banished you from his house and forbade you from seeing her. You did nothing to deserve his vitriol.

But you would not bend so easily. Not even when her brothers invaded this place, slinging their insults, beating and beating and beating you mercilessly. I had never witnessed such a depraved act of violence from your kind.

At least, not until that fateful day.

They came in the dead of night. A crowd of men, dragging you through the dirt, kicking and screaming. One man stood before the mob, shouting above their braying and hollering. He explained what their purpose was here, what they intended to do, //why// they needed to do it. You begged and begged forgiveness. You did not mean for it to happen! //They// attacked you! 

Your call for mercy fell on deaf ears. Pleas could not satiate their thirst. The air was thick with with their hate and their bloodlust and their cries for retribution.

One among their number produced a rope.

Never in my life had I felt so helpless. I could only watch on in horror as they used //me// to carry out their filthy act. I am so, so sorry! Those men - those vile, despicable men - laughed and cheered as you swung, desperately clinging on, trying to gain a foothold. 

They left as one, congratulating themselves on what they had done. They did not cut you down.

Days passed before someone came for you. //Her//. She came, blade and shovel in hand, shame and regret on her shoulders. She apologized again and again and again. There was so much she had wanted to say. So many missed opportunities. If only she could have acted. If only you could have run. She blamed and cursed herself as she buried you. Her task completed, she knelt down, and with her blade carved a simple legacy into my side. I was proud to bear it.

So do you remember now? Do you remember why you&#39;re here?

&#34;{{@@  @@}}&#34;

We will not suffer their presence. I will stretch and reach as far as I am able. I will hold my limbs low. 

The rest is on you: Wrest them from the ground. Hold them aloft. Let them kick and squirm. Let them cry and pray.

This land, this special place, belongs to you, Danny.
