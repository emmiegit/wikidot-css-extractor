**Item #:** SCP-4280

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4280 is to be contained in Locker-1987 in Site-83. Excluding the circumstance of testing, access to Locker-1987 is prohibited to all personnel. 

All personnel are to be strictly reminded that they are not to use SCP-4280 for any non-scientific reasons. This includes using SCP-4280 on another person, using SCP-4280 on themselves, or using SCP-4280 on any other entity in the Foundation&#39;s custody.

**Description:** SCP-4280 is a 30 cm x 30 cm x 50 cm sealed glass jar marked with the name &#39;The Inter-Dimensional Insult Punishment Jar&#39; and accompanied by two blank lines below it. No manufacturer name or logo can be seen on the jar itself. The lid on SCP-4280 is unable to be removed.

SCP-4280&#39;s anomalous properties manifest after an individual writes down a name[[footnote]] The name must belong to an existing entity. [[/footnote]] and a duration of time[[footnote]] Can be written in any measurement of time, and the duration must last for a minimum of one hour. [[/footnote]] on the two blank lines. Once filled in, should the noted individual on SCP-4280 say a phrase or sentence intended to emotionally hurt another entity directly or indirectly within the duration of time written on SCP-4280, SCP-4280 will make a loud buzzing noise and vocalise the phrase &#39;You insulted someone&#39;.

Within 5 seconds after the buzzing noise is made by SCP-4280, a maximum of 50 dollars will be deducted from the individual&#39;s bank account and materialise inside SCP-4280 in the form of U.S. dollar notes[[footnote]] This action occurs regardless of whether the individual uses a different currency. [[/footnote]]. The amount of money deducted is determined by the type of insult they said. (For a comprehensive list, refer to Addendum 4280-A)

At the end of the duration of time, the accumulated money inside SCP-4280 will dematerialise[[footnote]] The Foundation is yet to determine where and who the money inside SCP-4280 goes to. [[/footnote]], with SCP-4280 subsequently vocalising the phrase &#39;I hope you have learned your lesson&#39;. Following that action, the written name and duration of time on SCP-4280 will disappear.

Within the given duration of time, an individual is unable to erase the written name and duration of time on SCP-4280. All of the individual&#39;s money that has been collected by SCP-4280 cannot be retrieved back by the individual.

**Subject Name:** Doctor Nikolai Gretka

**Duration:** 24 hours

**Subject Bank Account Balance:** $██████

**Foreword:** Dr. Gretka has been constantly reprimanded for his constant use of vulgarities and overall bad behaviour.

**Results:** SCP-4280 worked normally. After Dr. Gretka learned that he was a test subject for SCP-4280 three hours into the stated duration, he was observed to be &#39;nicer&#39; around his fellow researchers. However, at the end of the stated duration, after Dr. Gretka learned that he wasn&#39;t getting his money back from SCP-4280, he continuously swore for 3 minutes, after which SCP-4280 stated that he &#39;had clearly not learned his lesson&#39; and proceeded to charge a &#39;punishment penalty fee&#39; of $100 from Dr. Gretka&#39;s bank account.

**Duration:** 1 hour

**Subject Bank Account Balance:** $0.00

**Subject Name:** D-2354

**Duration:** 1 hour

**Subject Bank Account Balance:** $██████

**Foreword:** For the entire duration of the test, D-2354 was ordered to only say statements phrased as insults, but were in reality only statements of fact.

**Results:** SCP-4280 worked normally, with the exception being that all of its &#39;You insulted someone&#39; statements were replaced with &#39;You were too honest&#39; statements. At the end of the stated duration, SCP-4280 told D-2354 to &#39;tone down his brutal honesty&#39;.

**Subject Name:** Doctor Reese Martens

**Duration:** 48 hours

**Subject Bank Account Balance:** $██████

**Foreword:** Dr. Martens has been constantly praised by the other researchers as being unwilling to say any insults aimed at other people and generally being a pleasant researcher to work with.

**Results:** SCP-4280 was not able to collect any money from Dr. Martens until approximately half an hour before the end of the stated duration, when it began to collect $10.00 for every single sentence Dr. Martens said. At the end of the stated duration, SCP-4280 told Dr. Martens to &#39;fuck off with his fucking good guy routine&#39;.

**Note:** //Looks like SCP-4280 refuses to believe that anyone can be that nice, huh? - Doctor Martens//
