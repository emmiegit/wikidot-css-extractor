Junior popped out onto a metallic hallway, the metal constructed in an obtuse, curved, and futuristic style that unsettled him. The silver sheen bounced light from corner to corner and it put him in a slight daze.

At once, he noticed a cold chill, he shrugged it off and started out in a full sprint down a random direction. He was ready to finally apprehend the thief. Danger stopped being a concern two universes back. Duchamp could just whisk him away when shit started to go bad or weird. 

He passed some men with white-coats who glanced over in his direction as he ran past. They looked to be like any normal researchers Junior saw on any regular Wednesday back in Site-99. One of them looked like a small child, oddly enough, smoking away on a //pipe//.

The hallway curved and Junior stopped as he reached the curve’s focal point. A large window pane revealed hundreds of ships, cruisers, and other vehicles suspended in space. Stars shimmered beyond them and in the background lay mighty nebulae that stood with authority.  

More than ever he was aware that he was far from his small desk and semi-functioning desktop. Curiously, he didn&#39;t look at the fantastic sight with awe. 

He was melancholic; knowing that most people would wish to experience the adventures he was undertaking. He acknowledged that his activities today would never be seen in the lifetime of any other person.  

But to Junior, being a researcher in the SCP Foundation was just a job. He was a materialistic young adult. Still not mature enough to realize his own potential. 

&#34;Hey, Duchamp, let me know if I&#39;m close to the goblin.&#34; Junior spoke, still full of vitality from the purple potion. 

&#34;Oh, the thief&#39;s not in this universe. I know it&#39;s been kind of hard for you to catch him so I thought it would be good for you to pick up a toy that will help. Keep going straight.&#34; Duchamp muffled while out of breath. He was on his own adventure apart from Junior. 

&#34;What is it?&#34; Junior asked as he started back up.

&#34;That&#39;ll ruin the surprise, won&#39;t it?&#34;

-----

&#34;Turn right at the next intersection.&#34; Duchamp chirped in every once in a while acting as a personal GPS. 

&#34;Boss, so I was thinking. Thanks for the top up back there. And thanks for helping me with that street thug.&#34; Junior said while panting as he turned right. 

&#34;No problem. But I only dropped my drink on you. I didn&#39;t rescue you or nothing, must&#39;ve been the thief.&#34; This was Junior&#39;s first experience with an anomalous entity. He had seen some in cages rolled past him back in 99, but not up close like he had been with the goblin. 

&#34;Why do you think it rescued me then?&#34; 

&#34;I don&#39;t know Junior. Maybe it&#39;s in love with you now that you&#39;ve been chasing it for so long.&#34; Duchamp giggled. 

Duchamp&#39;s blase attitude regarding everything had crept up again into the recesses of Junior&#39;s mind. He had been concerned since the nuclear blast a few universes back but now, with a clear head, a few other things annoyed him. 

Pretty lucky all things considering that the thief stole Gallagher&#39;s wig just as the meeting occurred, no? Blasphemous thoughts crossed Junior&#39;s thoughts as he reached the end of the corridor.

Two guards were standing at the end of the hallway. Both were sitting in chairs near a steel blast door.  The door was emblazoned with various words and symbols that Junior couldn&#39;t decipher.    

They looked up as Junior reached their desk.

&#34;My item is beyond that door. Go get it.&#34; Duchamp said while yawning. 

The guards looked quite young, even more than Junior. They wore simple security uniforms. Their hats displayed a unique formulation of the SCP logo that was quite striking. 

&#34;Do you need anything sir?&#34; One of them murmured with sarcasm while staring at Junior&#39;s helmet. 

&#34;Hi, yeah. Ahem! I&#39;d like to enter.&#34; Junior said while straightening his back, trying to ooze seniority. His whitecoat seemed to have tricked the men. 

&#34;Of course, comrade. Can I have your ID?&#34; 

Junior pretended to search his whitecoat. He overturned his pockets. 

&#34;Hmm, I left it in my office it seems.&#34; 

&#34;No problem, what&#39;s your name? I can just enter your info here.&#34; The other guard, tired of the situation already, tipped his cap and closed his eyes. 

&#34;Yeah sure. It&#39;s...umm...Duchamp.&#34; 

&#34;First name?&#34; The guard said while typing. 

Duchamp spoke up through Junior&#39;s earpiece. 

&#34;Hah! You&#39;re a bit sly aren&#39;tcha ya. Leaving me out to dry like that. My first name&#39;s Raphael. Let&#39;s see what happens. I&#39;m a bit curious too.&#34;

Junior told the typing guard Duchamp&#39;s first name as he heard it.

After a few clicks, the typing guard quickly tapped on the sleeping man’s knee. He uncovered his hat and leaned forward. 

They both stood up and walked to the front of the desk. To Junior&#39;s surprise, they knelt down and prostrated before him.  

&#34;Sun Priest Duchamp! I&#39;m sorry we haven’t properly recognized your eminence. Would you like us to tour the //divine armory// with you?&#34; The guards were still bowing before Junior as they spoke. 

&#34;That&#39;ll be alright. This is just a normal inspection.&#34;

&#34;Thank you! And please pray for our continued victory. We aren&#39;t sure if you&#39;ve heard the rumors from the citadel, but the Gamma fleet was struck down by the Luytenians...&#34;

One of the guards was rambling his fears to the &#34;Sun Priest&#34; as the other guard crawled to the computer to unlock the blast door. 

&#34;Don&#39;t worry, don&#39;t worry. I foresee our victory soon. Our fate has already been determined.&#34; Junior adapted to the clerical role with ease. He unconsciously raised his back and spoke at a higher pitch than before. 

&#34;Thank you and may Sol be with you,&#34; the guard exclaimed. 

The door opened with a gasp as pressurized locks unwinded. With both guards still kneeling, Junior walked into the hole the blast door unveiled. The lights sensed Junior and turned on in response. As he entered, the door closed behind him with a loud shunt.

The room was covered in a myriad of weapons, tools, and other paraphernalia hanging on the walls. As Junior wandered around, Duchamp&#39;s voice picked up. 

&#34;Good to know that my variant in this universe seems to be doing good for himself. &#39;Sun Priest,&#39; huh, he&#39;s a better scammer than me it seems.&#34; Duchamp chuckled. 

The talk of different variants made Junior think of his own in this parallel world. He wondered if he was a little similar to him. 

&#34;Ohh, it&#39;s right there below you!&#34; Duchamp quipped. 

Junior looked down and saw a small hot pink revolver. 

&#34;Uhh, are you sure?&#34; He asked with a puzzled expression. Most of the items in the room were quite threatening so it was quite absurd that this was the weapon he was pilfering. He would&#39;ve felt more safe with the &#34;Atomic Disassembler&#34; or &#34;Mind Destroyer&#34; that was nearer to him. 

But, like a good follower, Junior suppressed his discontent and pocketed the pistol. Just as he did, the whole room rocked to the side and he fell to the ground. But he caught himself with his hands.

&#34;They&#39;re onto me! Duchamp get me outta here.&#34; Before Duchamp could banter back, Junior dematerialized. 

Interestingly enough, the rocking was not due to Junior&#39;s theft. The Terzan 2 Ortothan Coalition initiated their surprise attack on the Foundation&#39;s main fleet. The Galactic War was reaching its climax.
