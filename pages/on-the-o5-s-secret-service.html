Intelligence suggested the scip was holed up somewhere in this hotel. A challenge to find, for any but the best. Fortunately for me, there&#39;s none better. Still, no cause to rush. Anyone here might hold the secrets to its location or, perhaps, to a most delightful evening.

I sit at the bar and swirl my drink. Much as it pains me to admit it, no one&#39;s mastered the art of the martini quite as well as the Yanks. The crowd presses around me, each person a tangle of lies and secrets. There&#39;s no honesty in what I do, but there&#39;s no honesty in any of the shadows that move about. At least I recognize it. And I also recognize that my secrets must stay so till the day I die. How many among those drinking, smiling, laughing here have once been given that little blissful pill when they saw secrets not for their eyes alone? I lean back in my seat, waiting.

And right on time destiny drops me a line. She&#39;s tall, dark hair, in a stunning evening dress that leaves just enough to the imagination. Walks right up to the bar. Of course, I can&#39;t let a beauty like that pay for her drink. Wouldn&#39;t be chivalrous. No sign of my contact yet, so I figured it was only a matter of time.

I ask her what she&#39;s doing at the hotel, and she says that she&#39;s passing through the area, and needed a place to stay. She looks me dead in the eye as she says it, and I know she doesn&#39;t have a room of her own just yet. Of course a dame like that is no stranger to duplicity. She&#39;s hiding something else, I know. But then, aren&#39;t they all? I ask her, already certain of the answer, if she has a place to stay. She says she doesn&#39;t and asks if I would be so kind as to accommodate a poor traveler such as her for a night. Being a gentleman, I can hardly refuse.

No good deed goes unrewarded.

And no good deed goes unpunished, I discover, as I awaken to find myself rudely tied to the hotel bed. It&#39;s strong rope, and professionally tied. So, one of my nighttime companion&#39;s secrets comes to light. I&#39;m really not surprised. My contact shouldn&#39;t have been late; he never is. And in my line of work, if someone doesn&#39;t show up, the only safe thing to do is to assume the worst. He&#39;s probably lying in a ditch somewhere, with his blood in the gutter. And if I didn&#39;t want to join him, I&#39;d have to act fast.

I ask her what she means by this, but she doesn&#39;t seem to be in a conversational mood. I don&#39;t see any goons, but if she&#39;s half as good as I fear, she has some just outside. If she&#39;s as good I&#39;m starting to think she may be, she won&#39;t even need them. Fortunately, an agent of the O5 is never unprepared. A sharpened nail goes to work on the rope binding my hands as she rummages through my bags. It&#39;s probably too much to hope that she&#39;ll stumble on one of the less... user friendly items I have in there. My love of women will kill me someday.

But today will not be that day. I snap through the rope, break out my false tooth, and, as she turns towards me with that oh so fetching look of shock on her exquisite features, I toss a pinch of niner-eighty-nine. It works fast, and soon she&#39;s down, hardly able to move save to claw futilely at the crusts over her face. Such a terrible waste.

I retrieve my gun. It&#39;s an MP5k, with apparently organic properties. Untracable, or so the boys in the Q Division assure me. I kiss her once on her sweetened forehead, and, though I know she can&#39;t hear me now, tell her she was beautiful. The gun twitches once, and so does she.

I&#39;m not clear yet. The door bursts open and in come her backup. All five of them, each armed. Fortunately, I&#39;m well prepared. Five against one? Well, I have the perfect distraction.

The disc sails cleanly into the doorway. It&#39;s always a wildcard, but this time it certainly delivers. A cloud of bees pours in from the hall, swarming the toughs. Even without them, it would probably be even. Untrained, inelegant, artless. I toss aside my gun. I won&#39;t be needing it. Four go down to shattered limbs and cracked skulls. They won&#39;t be moving again for a while. The last one, I take care not to hurt. I pick up 539, and the bees disperse. Time to get the information I need.

I packed the Combat Boots, so things go pretty easy for me. For him, too, if he considers the alternatives. The scip is in the penthouse suite, doesn&#39;t know we&#39;re after him. He&#39;s being taken care of by the Serpent&#39;s Hand, who certainly do, but I just managed to take out almost his entire escort. Amateurs, the lot of them.

I call in a clean-up squad and ride the elevator to the target&#39;s location. The door is locked, but like all modern hotels, opens on the first or second kick. The scip is sitting on the sofa, watching the news. He looks like a regular fellow, somewhat overweight, but I know better. I know him to be a rift in what reality should be, a living blasphemy against the natural order that England thrives on. He gets up, looks at me, and sees his fate. Three shots to the torso, and he falls. I walk over to him, remove his shirt. As I knew, where the stomach would be in any true human is instead a globe, dappled in blue and green. And molten red, where a bullet pierced it. Target confirmed. Target eliminated.

There&#39;s no point to containing that which can&#39;t be used. The only good scip is one that we control absolutely. There&#39;s no telling what anything less than a wholly contained one might do. The crown must be protected. So we Select. We Contain. We Prevent.

I am an agent of the Occidental 5. I have a license to kill.

The name is Bond. James Bond.
