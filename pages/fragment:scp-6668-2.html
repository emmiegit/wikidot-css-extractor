**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6668-1 and SCP-6668-2 are currently located in the Site-███ cafeteria. The latter&#39;s vital signs are to be monitored, with site leadership made aware of any change in condition. Excursion into the former is forbidden.

**Description:** SCP-6668-1 is a sinkhole in the cafeteria&#39;s floor of Site-███. SCP-6668-2 is an adult human, formerly D-1812019, located adjacent to SCP-6668-1. D-1812019 began to display anomalous properties upon returning from an exploration of SCP-6668-1. A log of this exploration is below:
[[div class=&#34;interview&#34;]]
**Foreword:** Despite best efforts, it was not possible to discern the depth of SCP-6668 from above. Any light shone into the anomaly experienced a drastic decrease in lumens. A crane was set-up over SCP-6668 to allow for exploration. D-1812019 was recruited to explore the anomaly, and attempt to locate Junior Researcher Morel.  Exploration was overseen by Site Director Hughes.

//[D-1812019 is strapped into a harness, connected to the crane. He is equipped with a standard issue video recording device and radio communications. He begins to descend into SCP-6668.]//

**Hughes:** D-class, what can you see? 

**D-1812019:** Well... nothing yet. It&#39;s dark in here. Real dark. Seems big too, as soon as I was below the initial opening I couldn&#39;t see the sides no more. It&#39;s just...black in every direction.

//[D-1812019 continues to descend for two minutes.]//

**D-1812019:** Ugh, Christ. I&#39;m getting something, a whole fucking something. It reeks down here. It smells worse than the mouldy crap up where you are. 

**Hughes:** Are there any discernible features yet?
 
**D-1812019:** Come again?

**Hughes:** Can you see anything?
 
**D-1812019:** Not at all. It&#39;s just dark. All dark.

//[D-1812019 continues to descend for another 3 minutes. By this point, he has descended a distance of 37m. This should place them 8 storeys below, on level B5.]// 
 
**D-1812019:** Hey, what happens if there&#39;s like, no bottom? If I can&#39;t find your guy, you&#39;ll still pull-

//[D-1812019 is interrupted by a wet, squelching sound.]//

**D-1812019:** Stop the crane, stop the crane! 

//[D-1812019&#39;s camera captures them being plunged, up to their waist, into a black, viscous liquid at the bottom of SCP-6668. The liquid has only become visible due to the disruption caused by D-1812019&#39;s partial submersion.]//

**Hughes:** Are you at the bottom?

**D-1812019:** Yeah, I&#39;ve reached it. Area&#39;s flooded in some type of black tar. //[He coughs.]// It&#39;s where that rancid smell&#39;s coming from.

**Hughes:** What does the floor feel like?

**D-1812019:** Uh, I dunno, a floor? It&#39;s... //[He stomps his feet]// soft? It gives way a bit when I press down.

**Hughes:** Can you see anything?

//[D-1812019 turns around. The light equipped to their helmet illuminates significantly less of themselves, and of the surrounding area, than it should.]//

**D-1812019:** There&#39;s a shape - it looks human. 

//[Several meters away from D-1812019, a shape floats in the liquid, wrapped in a Foundation lab coat.]//

**Hughes:** Is it Morel?

**D-1812019:** I can&#39;t see. It&#39;s so bloody dark in here. The body is, it&#39;s face down, floating in this //[He  retches]// tar. I think it&#39;s Morel? I can make out a lab coat.

**Hughes:** Alright; grab the body, and we&#39;ll pull you both out.

//[D-1812019 is silent, and does not move.]//

**Hughes:** That&#39;s an order, get the body and we&#39;ll get you out.

//[D-1812019 begins to breath heavily as he moves toward the body.]//

**D-1812019:** I&#39;m about to grab them, get ready to-

//[D-1812019 reaches out and pulls the back of the lab coat towards him. The mass contained within the lab coat splinters into smaller parts, which begin to move rapidly. A splashing sound becomes audible as the smaller masses move into the liquid.]//

**D-1812019:** It&#39;s not Morel! IT&#39;S NOT MOREL! Get me out of here! Get me the fuck out of here!

//[D-1812019 is left holding a lab coat - there is no sign of its former occupant.]//

**Hughes:** Let&#39;s pull him up!

//[D-1812019&#39;s camera jerks wildly. The splashing sound is still audible.]//

**D-1812019:** Something&#39;s in my suit! 

//[D-1812019 plunges their hands into the liquid, and begins hitting at their legs. At the same time, the crane retracts them, distorting their balance, sending D-1812019 falling into the liquid at the bottom of SCP-6668. He screams, until his face is submerged too.]//

//[The crane pulls D-1812019 out of the liquid, and he begins to ascend from SCP-6668. He is silent. Their camera is obfuscated by the thick, black liquid.]//

------

Upon recovery from SCP-6668-1, D-1812019 was unconscious. They were removed from their harness, and medical staff were called for. Before they could arrive, D-1812019 began to levitate.  

Now designated SCP-6668-2, D-1812019 is currently suspended in the air, in a non-responsive state, 1m above the floor of Site ███&#39;s cafeteria.

Sounds of movement are audible from within SCP-6668-1.
