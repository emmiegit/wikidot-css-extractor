##PaleVioletRed|Angel:## It&#39;s just so much bad vibes. And like, such a //boy// thing to listen to.

##coral|Cora:## ugh, listening to it&#39;s making me feel sick

##hotpink|Sara:## oookay. no queens, then

##hotpink|Sara:## so like

##black|PINK FLY:## Taylor Swift, mostly.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Hi ##hotpink|Sara##!

##hotpink|Sara:## uhhhh what just happened

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Mmm. THAT stuff.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Cora is... a bit sensitive, I guess is the best way to put it.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## I guess there&#39;s no easy way to say this: Cora was in a cult.

##hotpink|Sara:## oh. shit, that&#39;s horrible

##deeppink|KeeLee:## It&#39;s all a bit complicated, I know. But, we&#39;re community, and community helps those in need.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Me and the girls have done a lot of work trying to readjust her to normal.

##hotpink|Sara:## uhhhh

##hotpink|Sara:## sure that&#39;s like

##deeppink|KeeLee:## I wasn&#39;t finished.

##deeppink|KeeLee:##  Please don&#39;t interrupt me during something as serious as this.

##hotpink|Sara:## right, sorry

##deeppink|KeeLee:## As I was saying, Cora was in a cult. Brainwashing, vile stuff, made her think she was a man.

##hotpink|Sara:## ... shit, my condolences.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Again, do not interrupt me.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## We&#39;ve tried breaking it, sure. Us girls did a good job! But, there&#39;s residue.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## I&#39;m not sure how, but you triggered some cult meme in the back of her brain.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## So I suppose just be more careful in the future.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## You may respond.

##hotpink|Sara:## right

##hotpink|Sara:## i&#39;m sorry she had to go through that. i uh, have a friend she could talk to. went through something similar with conversion therapy, came out the other end living her best self.

##hotpink|Sara:## idk. i&#39;m not trans but i know the world gets very hard if you are.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## ...

##hotpink|Sara:## and it&#39;s good to have su-what&#39;s that for

##deeppink|KeeLee:## I mean no offense, ##hotpink|Sara##, but we&#39;re trying to get her //out// of the cult.

##hotpink|Sara:## whu

##hotpink|Sara:## what kinda cult are you talking about

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Listen: you have talent. You&#39;re an amazing artist (even if I //do// need you to redesign a few of your proposed layouts). But if you can&#39;t treat Cora&#39;s condition with respect, I don&#39;t know if I can have you on the team. 

##deeppink|KeeLee:## She&#39;s been //hurt//. Ingrained with poisonous cult nonsense. Had her sense of self effectively //raped//. You can&#39;t come in here expecting to fix that.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## I&#39;m not //paying// you for that.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Enough of that.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Good work on the banner! While I&#39;ll need you to overhaul the the articles, front page, and contacts, you&#39;ve more than earned that bounty.

##hotpink|Sara:## uh, thanks.

##hotpink|Sara:## i&#39;ll see what i can do. send me some changelists and i&#39;ll get to it

##hotpink|Sara:## in a day, tho. i got a date with a cute dude at 7

//Topic set by ##deeppink |KeeLee## on Fri Sep 03 2010 16:01:34 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)//

##hotpink|Sara:## ##deeppink|KeeLee## Explain right the fuck now.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## How did you //do// that?

##hotpink|Sara:## No. Explain.

##black|PINK FLY:## Oooooh dear.

##hotpink|Sara:## No less than three of the chat&#39;s in on some

##hotpink|Sara:## fuck me

##hotpink|Sara:## Why are you trafficking with conversion therapists?

##deeppink|KeeLee:## ##hotpink|Sara##, quit dodging the question.

##hotpink|Sara:## Oh, //I&#39;m// dodging the question? I&#39;m sorry, were we in the same chatroom?

##deeppink|KeeLee:## ##hotpink|Sara##, when I ask you a question, it is only polite to respond.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## I&#39;m concerned with your behavior. You&#39;re too aggressive, and while I appreciate what you&#39;ve brought to the table, it isn&#39;t enough for you to treat us like this.

##hotpink|Sara:## oh for

##hotpink|Sara:## My friend made a sightfuck.

##hotpink|Sara:## Image with special properties. You know what those properties are?

##hotpink|Sara:## //Jamming previous sightfucks!//

##hotpink|Sara:## So riddle me this, batman, why the fuck did it work?

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Oh dear.

##hotpink|Sara:## Yeah, &#34;oh dear.&#34;

##hotpink|Sara:## So when are you going to kick these fuckers?

##deeppink|KeeLee:## ##hotpink|Sara##

##deeppink|KeeLee:## I&#39;m going to be honest with you.

##hotpink|Sara:## about time

##deeppink|KeeLee:## You are an incredibly poor judge of character.

##hotpink|Sara:## ...

##deeppink|KeeLee:## You come in here, accusing your //employer// of all things of running a conspiracy against you.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## On the basis of... who?

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Someone who would traffic a dangerous memetic hazard?

##hotpink|Sara:## what are you doing

##deeppink|KeeLee:## This &#34;friend&#34; of yours has poisoned the well. He&#39;s obviously jealous; you have good pay, a supportive environment, and don&#39;t get me //started// on how this looks on a resume.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## He&#39;s sensed that you&#39;ve been a bit ungrateful. That you&#39;ve put a wedge between us.

##hotpink|Sara:## shut up

##deeppink|KeeLee:## It&#39;s true.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## He&#39;s exploited said wedge, trying to drive you out. Did he even test his meme? Did you see it in action before you used it?

##hotpink|Sara:## shut the fuck up. she&#39;s been this

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Has she? And yet this meme had the exact //opposite// effect. How do you know she&#39;s not lying, ##hotpink|Sara##? I know it can be hard to accept, but this is a clear-cut case of a crab in a bucket.

##hotpink|Sara:## FUCK OFF

##hotpink|Sara## Contract off. JGT 2.0 can run on a dosbox for all I care. Pay me for my hours or I get a lawyer.

##black|PINK FLY:## It is what it is.

##hotpink|Sara:## left to right: izzy, lyanna, jack. they&#39;re cool you should meet them

##black|PINK FLY:## Oh, interesting.

##black|PINK FLY:## You actually look a bit familiar.

##hotpink|Sara:## oh yeah! we&#39;ve played a few shows around soho, mostly eird shit, been to any of those

##black|PINK FLY:## Not quite. Sorry, I feel like I know you from somewhere, but I can&#39;t put my finger on it.

##hotpink|Sara:## :?

##hotpink|Sara:## word&#39;s gotten around fast?

##black|PINK FLY:## Wait, now I remember.

##black|PINK FLY:## iicameras.prm/models/babylonshedim

##black|PINK FLY:## Is this you?

##hotpink|Sara:## ...

##black|PINK FLY:## I&#39;ll admit it&#39;s an interesting revenue model. Do Rivka and Yehezkel know about this?

##hotpink|Sara:## ...

##black|PINK FLY:## Hmm.

##black|PINK FLY:## Should I tell them?

##hotpink|Sara:## how did you know that

##black|PINK FLY:## Answer the question, before I make that choice.

##hotpink|Sara:## no

##hotpink|Sara:## please don&#39;t

##black|PINK FLY:## Oh, really?

##black|PINK FLY:## Hrm, maybe I //want// to. What to do, what to do...

##hotpink|Sara:## what do you want

##hotpink|Sara:## tell me what you want

##black|PINK FLY:## Right now? What I //really// want is to spread the word.

##black|PINK FLY:## I&#39;ve been meaning to break down the annoying little jewess for a while. Breaking my memetics was the red line, really, but I bit my tongue until you started pushing it.

##black|PINK FLY:## ##deeppink|KeeLee##&#39;s wrong, you //have// been useful. I&#39;m not much of a web developer, but this work on the site proper bumped my pay grade too much to ignore.

##black|PINK FLY:## It&#39;d be a //shame// to lose you now.

##hotpink|Sara:## ...

##black|PINK FLY:## Can I count on you?

##hotpink|Sara:## ...

##hotpink|Sara:## yes ma&#39;am.

##black|PINK FLY:## Good.

##black|PINK FLY:## And, oh: as thanks for my generosity, I&#39;ll be taking half your wages.

##black|PINK FLY:## But it&#39;s better than the nothing you&#39;d get otherwise, isn&#39;t it?

##hotpink|Sara:## you took everything from me. my pay, my dignity, my integrity, what little happiness i had left, and crushed it into a plastic, eye-searing paste. all i have left is sara, and i&#39;ll die before you get to take that too

##violet|Jess:## .tells Sara &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;

##violet|Jess:## &#34;I didn&#39;t know things have been rough. Hoping they get better.&#34;

##violet|Jess:## &#34;About two minutes ago, I knew I wanted to say something, but it&#39;s hard. I don&#39;t know.&#34;

##violet|Jess:## &#34;JGT isn&#39;t for everyone. Obviously it&#39;s not for you. I get that. But there&#39;s good people there, people who&#39;ve helped me carry on in the face of incredibly dark times. No matter your experience with Kee or Terry, there will always be someone that has your back.&#34;

##violet|Jess:## &#34;Actually, ignore that last line.&#34;

##violet|Jess:## &#34;I was hoping I could know you better. As a friend. You&#39;re lively and opinionated and strong and smart and everything I wish I could be. even the nights you came in drunk were some of the best times I&#39;ve had on the JGT chat.&#34;

##violet|Jess:## &#34;I don&#39;t know. It doesn&#39;t have to be JGT. I just want to talk.&#34;

##violet|Jess:## .tells

##darkred|JGTBot:## Got it! I&#39;ll send them lickety-split!
