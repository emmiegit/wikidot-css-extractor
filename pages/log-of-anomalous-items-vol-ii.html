&gt; **Foreword:** The SCP Foundation has discovered a substantial number of items which are simply too useless to merit further attention. This document lists those items which have prompted some curiosity. It may be used as a resource should knowledge of these items become useful or necessary in the future. 
&gt; – Dr. █████ █████, Head of Research, Site-██

This is the second volume of the log. Due to the increasing number of items discovered by the Foundation, this list is no longer open to new entries. For ease of archival, the [[[log-of-anomalous-items | first]]], [[[log-of-anomalous-items-vol-iii | third]]], [[[log-of-anomalous-items-vol-iv | fourth]]] and [[[log-of-anomalous-items-vol-v | fifth]]] volumes of this log have been made available, and the [[[log-of-anomalous-items-vol-vi | sixth]]] remains open to new additions.
 
Lists of [[[log-of-extranormal-events| Extranormal Events]]] and [[[log-of-unexplained-locations| Unexplained Locations]]] have also been compiled.

**Item Description:** A life-sized doll filled with interstellar particulate matter and trace amounts of metallic hydrogen. The item mimics the appearance of [[[SCP-4519|the late astronomer Carl Edward Sagan]]].
**Date of Recovery:** 1996/12/21
**Location of Recovery:** Fred Hutchinson Research Center, Seattle, Washington
**Recovery Log:** On the morning after Carl Sagan&#39;s death, mortuary technicians noticed Sagan&#39;s body had gone missing. Law enforcement dispatched on-site reported that a person or group of persons had stolen and replaced the body, discovering the doll alongside a Freedom From Religion brochure. Foundation agents later released a cover story proposing that the incident was a practical joke.

For the ensuing two months, Sagan&#39;s cadaver could not be located. To mitigate distress within the Sagan family, Foundation agents planned a necessary cover-up funeral. On February 27, 1997, the Amnestics Department orchestrated a secular public memorial service for Carl Sagan&#39;s life. Throughout the service, personnel posing as funerary staff dispersed a specialized gaseous Class-E/W &#34;Solace&#34; a/mnestic cocktail. As a result, persons attending the service had memories and feelings associated with melancholy and grief replaced with a reinforced mass fondness for the late Sagan.
