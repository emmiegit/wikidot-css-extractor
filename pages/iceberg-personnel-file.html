Profile: Dr. █████ is low level researcher currently employed by the Foundation. While hard working, &#34;Iceberg&#34; is noted on various sites for numbers negative characteristics, from egotism to several possible mental conditions.

&#34;If you have any major paperwork, feel free to give it to this guy. He just burns through it. - Unknown

&#34;When I find who wrote that I&#39;ll do all the paperwork, I&#39;m gonna kill you all kinds of dead.&#34; -Dr. Iceberg

&#34;Paperwork notes still in effect.&#34; -Anonymous

&#34;Let me dispel a rumor going around. While I may go many places with my labcoat on, I certainly do not shower with it on. That would just be weird. I only sleep with it on.&#34; - Dr. Iceberg
