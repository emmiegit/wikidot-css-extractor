Profile: Dr. █████ is low level researcher currently employed by the Foundation. While hard working, &#34;Iceberg&#34; is noted on various sites for numbers negative characteristics, from egotism to several possible mental conditions.

&#34;Let me dispel a rumor going around. While I may go many places with my labcoat on, I certainly do not shower with it on. That would just be weird. I only sleep with it on.&#34; - Dr. Iceberg
