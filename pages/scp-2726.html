**Item #:** SCP-2726

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** One instance of SCP-2726, designated SCP-2726-001, is kept on a private ████████ page operated by the Foundation. The account in question must not interact with any other ████████ accounts, and is used exclusively for the purpose of performing research on SCP-2726 and communicating with SCP-2726-A. One individual, currently Dr. Prasad, is to remain the sole direct observer of SCP-2726-001, --and must adhere to an appropriate cover story during interactions with SCP-2726-A.-- As Dr. Prasad and SCP-2726-A have developed a rapport, the cover story restriction has been lifted for the duration of Dr. Prasad&#39;s involvement with the SCP-2726 project. See **Interview Log 2726-D3**.

Personnel are to manually search ████████, beginning with the known acquaintances and general milieu of &#34;mashedpork&#34;, for instances of SCP-2726. Each page must be viewed on no less than eleven separate occasions before SCP-2726&#39;s absence can be confirmed. Instances must be deleted upon identification, and all known viewers must be amnesticized as appropriate. Web Crawler MASHEDPORK-0A-2726 is set to remove all material referring to SCP-2726.

**Description:** SCP-2726 is the collective designation for an estimated --200-- 25 posts on social media site ████████, attributed to the user &#34;mashedpork&#34;. The account in question was deleted before SCP-2726 developed anomalous properties; as such, SCP-2726 is composed of those posts that were shared to another user&#39;s page prior to the account&#39;s deletion. The original operator of mashedpork has not been identified conclusively.[[footnote]]Information given by SCP-2726-A corresponds to Jadzia ████████████ of Kalisz, Poland (deceased as of 2016-05-14). However, there is no conclusive evidence that Jadzia ████████████ operated mashedpork.[[/footnote]]

The contents of SCP-2726 are controlled by a sapient entity, designated SCP-2726-A, claiming to be a &#34;ghost&#34; of mashedpork&#39;s operator. SCP-2726-A communicates by altering the contents of SCP-2726 in real-time via an unknown method; changes can be detected by refreshing the web browser, and input can be sent to SCP-2726-A using ████████&#39;s built-in &#34;Reply&#34; function. SCP-2726-A is aware of how many individuals are observing SCP-2726 at any given time, as well as any conversations it has had with the individuals in question.

SCP-2726 instances and their contents cannot be located by any tested search algorithm, all of which ignore SCP-2726&#39;s presence. Individuals deliberately searching for SCP-2726 will frequently (~80% of the time) fail to identify the presence of an instance on any site with other content, making it difficult to confirm that SCP-2726 is not present on any given ████████ page.

= **Interview Log 2726-D3**

SCP-2726-A was interviewed on 2016-07-18 by Dr. Prasad. No specific agenda was set for the interview; to date, it has been the most informative with regards to SCP-2726. The transcript is presented in standard format for readability purposes.

&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** mooooom just five more minutes
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** Is this a bad time for you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** time is illegal for ghosts actually. what&#39;s up?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** The usual. Work is slowing down at least.
&gt; 
&gt; How are you feeling?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** as it turns out ghostland does not have prozac so. still sad. i&#39;m working on it.
&gt; 
&gt; but then again that stuff is probably why i&#39;m dead so i can&#39;t complain.
&gt; 
&gt; i&#39;m not even sure i can actually commit ghost suicide. is double death possible in real life?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** That&#39;s not really my area of expertise.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** I Wish A Green Asshole Would Break Into My Ghost House And Shoot A Mouth Laser At Me Double-Killing Me Instantly
&gt; 
&gt; oh hey is today the 18th
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** Yep.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** it&#39;s been two months since i was created then woohoo
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** I thought you died on May 14th?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** well yeah but it took the lads four days to get this set up. surprisingly getting a ghost to replicate your dead friend on the online is a really involved process.
&gt; 
&gt; apparently you have to make a sacrifice to the corn god which is pretty fucked up since corn is a mother fuck of a shit.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** Replicate?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** it&#39;s like that one episode of black mirror where she gets a robot looking like her dead bf that acts like him cuz it downloaded all of his social media posts.
&gt; 
&gt; except instead of a robot i&#39;m a ghost.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** Oh. That makes sense.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** have i mentioned that dick mirror sucks?
&gt; 
&gt; you know what i&#39;m gonna rant about that show now.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** Go right ahead.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** like putting aside the fact that they flip a coin about whether to put banksy on the writing team for each episode and how they could do so much more if they weren&#39;t stuck on one episode per setting they just have no clue about the whole scope of things that technology can actually do.
&gt; 
&gt; i mean not everyone runs with weirdo magic netizens so that&#39;s probably not a fair criticism but still like believe me when i say that half of this stuff is like super pedestrian from my standpoint of view.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;ohh in this dystopia everybody has to jog all the time and reality tv is shallow and it&#39;s mean bluh bluh&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; yeah tell me when you can downvote people into popcorn hell and also rig their posts to blow up in real life. maybe that&#39;ll get my attention.
&gt; 
&gt; i&#39;m probably not doing a good job of making my point here. there&#39;s a reason i don&#39;t do litcrit shit.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** You&#39;re doing fine, but if there are specific examples of things you think might happen in real life, that would help drive it home.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** nice try officer.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** Can you blame me though?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** yes. bad boy. *hits you with a rolled-up newspaper*
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** *Phases through it because I&#39;m a hologram*
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** it&#39;s a holographic newspaper.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** In that case, &#34;Ow.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** anyways where were we? i feel like we got off track.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** You were talking about how you became a ████████ ghost, and then you complained about Black Mirror.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** oh right. that&#39;s one mystery solved for ya.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** Any idea why your posts are so hard to find?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** oh yeah i was wondering when you&#39;d ask that.
&gt; 
&gt; like you know those urban legends and stuff where something spooky is out on the web somewhere but nobody knows where and it&#39;s just sort of a mystery thing you&#39;d run into at some point?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** I think I know what you&#39;re talking about, yeah.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** well that&#39;s indisputably cool as fuck but also not something you can normally do these days.
&gt; 
&gt; day 1 thing happens
&gt; 
&gt; day 2 someone finds thing and it goes viral
&gt; 
&gt; day 3 it&#39;s trending on google and twitter
&gt; 
&gt; day 4 buzzfeed article You&#39;ll Never Guess How This Girl&#39;s Friends Memorialized Her After Her Suicide
&gt; 
&gt; day 5 fine bros video Teens React To Digital Ghost
&gt; 
&gt; etc.
&gt; 
&gt; the internet ruined the internet so we don&#39;t get to have nice things any more.
&gt; 
&gt; the lads knew how i felt. thankfully magic is real so they set this up for me and i get to just be a chill thing that people happen across every once in a while without being a big deal.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** That sounds awfully nice of them.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** yeah i&#39;m a creepypasta now. dysphoria = cured.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** Maybe I&#39;ve heard of these &#34;lads&#34;?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** i mean i don&#39;t know if you specifically have but we both know you&#39;re a janitor sooo
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** You&#39;re confusing me with my younger brother, I think.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** lmao you&#39;re so bad at lying. i mean janitor as in you&#39;re one of the guys that goes around and cleans up all the magic stuff that happens. like you&#39;re with the government or something.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** It&#39;s that obvious to you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** i mean i figured it out eventually.
&gt; 
&gt; but whatever i maintained a strictly cool calm and collected internet persona (i&#39;ve been in full control of my emotions with every keystroke i make) so i literally do not know how to hold that against you. weird huh.
&gt; 
&gt; sometimes i wonder how i felt about stuff in life.
&gt; 
&gt; the lads are &#39;gamers against weed&#39; they pretty much do internet stuff with magic.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** Oh. I think I&#39;ve heard of them, actually.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** yeah i thought so. 
&gt; 
&gt; they say hi btw and they want me to tell you &#34;ur a binch&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** I&#39;m flattered.
&gt; 
&gt; Can I ask another question, incidentally?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** i literally don&#39;t know how to shut up like if you keep talking i&#39;m pretty sure i have to keep responding.
&gt; 
&gt; so the answer is always yes to things like that but i&#39;m just gonna lie if i don&#39;t feel like answering.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** How would I go about getting a ghost like you, if I needed one for something?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** what
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** Is that such a surprising question, considering what it is you say I do?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** yeah i kind of assumed you already knew how to do that it&#39;s such a common thing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** I&#39;m afraid not.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** oh huh. well you pretty much just rent them for like a hundred and eighty euros a year and you can put them into pretty much anything if you know how but they won&#39;t really do anything without some information to imprint.
&gt; 
&gt; otherwise they&#39;ll just be like the most generic people possible and it&#39;s the most unnerving goddamn thing on the planet.
&gt; 
&gt; and once your time is up they just kinda go back to the netherworld and whatever they were in stops working. it&#39;s pretty great honestly like there&#39;s no hassle and it&#39;s all chill.
&gt; 
&gt; sometimes you get dead bodies though which is less chill.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** Hm. That explains a lot, actually.
&gt; 
&gt; Where could I rent a ghost? You left that part out.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** i&#39;m not gonna lie dude.
&gt; 
&gt; if you could just borrow souls for whatever the hell you people wanted, i really don&#39;t want to know what you&#39;d use them for.
&gt; 
&gt; i doubt it would be anything as nice as this.
&gt; 
&gt; so i&#39;m not gonna tell you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** Well, I had to try.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** yeah i know. *whap whap*
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Prasad:** Stop that.
&gt; 
&gt; Or continue, if you prefer. That&#39;s all the time I have for today. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2726-A:** this newspaper still has your name on it but i guess it can deal. see ya.
