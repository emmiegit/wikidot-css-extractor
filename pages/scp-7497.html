**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-7497 is secured in a minimum 3 cm thick Boron Adamantite[[footnote]]Highly dense and resilient anomalous metallic compound related to [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6952 SCP-6952].[[/footnote]] box with its lid welded shut airtight. The Boron Adamantite box containing SCP-7497 is placed in High-Risk Containment Chamber 14 in Site-612[[footnote]]Foundation site in Malaysia.[[/footnote]], where one Scranton Reality Anchor (SRA) is installed on each wall. Four security cameras with bulletproof lens and reinforced steel casing are installed in the containment chamber to monitor SCP-7497 at all times. Service drones are deployed once per week to maintain the structural integrity of the Boron Adamantite box and proper functionalities of the SRAs. No personnel are allowed to enter the containment chamber of SCP-7497 under any circumstances.

In the event of a containment breach, any ongoing or upcoming court trials and nongovernmental hearings within Malaysia which could involve false accusations, foul play, or irresponsible enforcement must be investigated, especially those involving the death penalty. Foundation agents must monitor court trials and nongovernmental hearings suspected of the misconducts above and prepare to recontain SCP-7497 once it remanifests. 

Any civilian who survived an encounter with SCP-7497 is to be placed under medical care and constant surveillance in civilian hospitals under Foundation control. Amnestic treatment and media suppression are executed accordingly to remove any public knowledge of SCP-7497. Appropriate cover stories are distributed to the public to justify the casualties caused by SCP-7497.

**Description:**

SCP-7497 is a 38 cm long Malaysian kris from the 18th century. SCP-7497 has a wavy blade made of iron-nickel alloy and infused with arsenic compounds. The hilt of SCP-7497 is made of //Neobalanocarpus heimii//[[footnote]]Commonly known as Chengal.[[/footnote]] wood and its configuration indicates the existence of a fitting sheath, but all attempts to locate the sheath of SCP-7497 have thus far failed. SCP-7497 possesses anomalous sharpness and invulnerability, allowing it to cut through non-anomalous materials with ease and resist any form of conventional damage.

SCP-7497 possesses a strong cognitohazardous memetic trigger effect towards a human subject who is a victim of false accusation, foul play, or irresponsible enforcement, especially if it involves sentencing the subject to death. If a court trial or nongovernmental hearing held in Malaysia involves a convicted subject fulfilling the condition of SCP-7497’s effect, SCP-7497 will manifest on the closest stable surface within the reach of the subject during the trial. Once the subject sees, touches, or is made aware of the presence of SCP-7497 through verbal statements of other attendants, the subject will be compelled to pick up SCP-7497 and use it to commit suicide as a way to prove their innocence, most commonly by impaling their own heart. Direct contact with SCP-7497’s blade transmutes the blood of the subject to contain 70% to 90% of lymphocytes, turning the colour of their blood white. The subject will then enter a hysteric state and use SCP-7497 to attack other attendants of the trial, making high-pitched vocalizations in Old Malay in the process even if they have no prior knowledge of the language. The subject is able to maintain mobility for a much longer period of time compared to average humans inflicted with the same injuries. After the subject expires from the self-inflicted wound using SCP-7497, SCP-7497 will immediately demanifest. 

Current records indicate that SCP-7497 can only manifest in one location at a time, but it can manifest an unlimited number of times per day as long as the conditions are fulfilled. The application of SRA in close proximity is able to inhibit SCP-7497 from demanifesting, but SCP-7497 has displayed the capability to levitate and move independently at up to 40 km/h within a limited amount of time in several attempts to breach containment. Whether SCP-7497 possesses a consciousness of its own or is acting based on some form of predetermined routine is unknown. 

Due to the tendency of SCP-7497 to cause mass civilian casualties, all testing involving SCP-7497 is prohibited until further notice.

**Addendum 01: Discovery**

[[collapsible show=&#34;Open Document&#34; hide=&#34;Close Document&#34;]]

The earliest known manifestation of SCP-7497 was documented in the diary of an unnamed lieutenant from the Siamese armada in the 19th century, who participated in the invasion of Pulau Langkawi, Malaysia. According to the diary, SCP-7497 manifested during the trial of a young woman who was falsely accused of theft and sentenced to death after refusing to marry a Siamese general. The subject slit her carotid artery using SCP-7497 while screaming in Old Malay to declare her innocence, and the blood flowing from her wound was white. The subject was able to rampage for over 5 minutes and kill 15 Siamese soldiers before expiring as a result of blood loss.

SCP-7497 manifestations were infrequent before the 20th century, mostly active during private trials and illegal executions, making it difficult for the Foundation to track and contain the anomaly in time. In the 21st century, SCP-7497 began to manifest frequently in Malaysian courts and cause mass casualties, but this also provided the Foundation with opportunities to predict its behaviour and prepare for its containment. 

On 14/08/1998, the court trial of Zhang Qi Ming (male, 32 years old) was held, charging the subject with drug trafficking. The subject would be sentenced to death if he was found guilty. An informant revealed to the Foundation that the police chief, Karim Makmur, charged the subject with insufficient evidence to increase his chance of promotion, as the fingerprints found on the Amphetamine containers did not belong to the subject. The judge, Ranjit Krishnan, also received bribes from Karim Makmur. As this is the only case fulfilling SCP-7497’s manifestation requirements in 3 days, the Foundation stationed undercover agents and mobile task force members in the court. After Ranjit Krishnan found the subject guilty, SCP-7497 manifested on the table in front of the subject. Before the subject could pick up SCP-7497, the mobile task force was able to tranquilize the subject and deploy SRAs around SCP-7497. SCP-7497 was successfully secured in a reinforced steel container and transported to Site-612.

**Addendum 02: SCP-7497 Incident 028 Video Log**

[[collapsible show=&#34;Open Document&#34; hide=&#34;Close Document&#34;]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Incident #:** 028
**Item #:** SCP-7497
**Video Filename:** MAHKAMAH_NEGERI_PAHANG_ARCHIVE_1038.mp4
**Date:** 01/06/1993

**Foreword:**
Parwati Ramesh (female, 22 years old) was tried in the State Court of Pahang for the murder of her sister, Tara Ramesh. The husband of Tara Ramesh, Arhaan Ranni, was also present at the court trial. The video was recorded by Izwan Kasturi, the digital archivist of the State Court of Pahang.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

[INSIGNIFICANT CONTENT OMITTED FOR BREVITY]

The prosecutor, Alvin Guan, claimed that Parwati Ramesh struck the back of Tara Ramesh’s head multiple times using a ceramic glass vase, directly causing Tara Ramesh’s death. Only the subject’s fingerprints were found on the vase. The subject retorted that she gifted the vase to Arhaan Ranni 1 month ago upon his request, claiming that he used it to shift the responsibility of the murder to her. 

After Parwati Ramesh and her defending lawyer, Amirul Hassan, failed to provide solid evidence to support her claim, the judge, Aina Rashid, found the subject guilty of murder and sentenced her to death. Before the court police could remove Parvati Ramesh from the court, SCP-7497 manifested on the floor in front of the subject. The subject picked up SCP-7497 and started vocalizing loudly in Old Malay, breaking free of her handcuffs in a hysteric state and impaled her own heart using SCP-7497. The subject proceeded to stab both court police multiple times in the chest and pursue Arhaan Ranni, who tried to leave the court with the crowd. The subject mortally injured several civilians before pinning down Arhaan Ranni and decapitating him using SCP-7497.

20 second later, Parwati Ramesh expired as a result of blood loss, and SCP-7497 immediately demanifested.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:**

Incident 028 recorded a total of 15 casualties directly caused by SCP-7497, and 8 indirect casualties caused by civilians falling and trampling in their attempt to escape SCP-7497. 

Analysis reports indicated that the blood stains of Parwati Ramesh found in the court and all the remaining blood in the subject’s body were transmuted to contain 78.5% of lymphocytes. Further investigation revealed that Parwati Ramesh had no prior knowledge of Old Malay before the incident. 

The English translation of the subject’s repeated vocalization during the incident is available below:

**Addendum 03: SCP-7497 Containment Breach Report**

[[collapsible show=&#34;Open Document&#34; hide=&#34;Close Document&#34;]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Incident #:** 134
**Item #:** SCP-7497
**Title:** Containment Breach 01
**Date:** 30/09/1998

**Foreword:**
As of Incident 134, SCP-7497 was contained in a 5 mm thick reinforced steel box in High-Risk Containment Chamber 14, with one SRA installed on the ceiling.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

At 3:26 am, the security cameras installed in High-Risk Containment Chamber 14 detected vibrations and a series of slight position shifts of the reinforced steel container holding SCP-7497. The number of security officers stationed around the containment chamber was doubled. 

At 3:43 am, SCP-7497 used its blade to make a 28 cm x 4 cm incision on the reinforced steel container and escaped the container, levitating in the middle of the containment chamber without the assistance of any observable external force or entity. SCP-7497 proceeded to destroy the security cameras and SRA installed within the containment chamber.

At 3:44 am, SCP-7497 destroyed the locking mechanism of its containment chamber, breaching containment. In an attempt to delay SCP-7497 from demanifesting before the other security officers managed to activate a temporary SRA array around SCP-7497, Security Officer Amin Abdullah managed to hold onto the hilt of SCP-7497 and inhibit the anomaly’s movement.

At 3:45 am, after causing 3 stab wounds on Officer Abdullah, SCP-7497 produced high-pitched and high amplitude vocalization in Old Malay through unknown means, permanently damaging the hearing of all Foundation personnel within a 15 m radius. The sudden outburst and physical pain caused Officer Abdullah to lose his grip on SCP-7497. SCP-7497 proceeded to move out of the range of the temporary SRA array and demanifest.

At 9:05 pm, SCP-7497 manifested during the illegal public execution of Aina Rashid (female, 24 years old) in Pahang, Malaysia. Aina Rashid was accused of causing the death of her father-in-law, Aman Takdir, with black magic. SCP-7497 was successfully recontained after causing 34 casualties.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:**

After Incident 134, the special containment procedures of SCP-7497 were further restricted and included the approved use of Boron Adamantite. 

The English translation of SCP-7497’s vocalization during the containment breach is available below:

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
[[=]]
**YOU WILL NOT TIE ME TO A TREE AGAIN**
**FOR GREED, FOR JEALOUSY, REFUSING TO BELIEVE**
**IT IS ALL FOR YOUR FILTHY EYES TO SEE**
**LET THE WHITE BLOOD SPILL**
**LET THE RED BLOOD PAY**
**THIS IS THE ONLY WAY**
**THEIR INNOCENCE WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN**
**I WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN**

**Title:** Urgent Discovery on SCP-7497 Survivors Development
**Time Received:** 20/02/2010, 11:35 pm

Mr. Hukum,

Sorry for contacting you at this hour. As you probably know, our department conducted testing on the new updates of SITI[[footnote]]Web crawler software developed by Site-612, recently updated to include the capability to track and profile civilians who are exposed to anomalies.[[/footnote]] 3 months ago by telling it to collect social media information on civilians who encountered various SCPs from our site in the past. SITI completed the procedure just now, and we found some disturbing results about the survivors of SCP-7497.

Every documented civilian who is not the wrongfully convicted victim and survived SCP-7497 are dead 7 years after the incident, except two. One of them is an old woman who never left the city she was born in her entire life, which also happens to be where she went to court and encountered SCP-7497. The other one is a middle-aged man, who escaped the court unscathed but got caught in a traffic accident right after. He is still in a coma as of today and hospitalized in the same city he encountered SCP-7497. 

We believe we are looking at a dangerous pattern here, director. It is highly possible that SCP-7497 is affecting those victims through some form of probabilistic anomaly. From what SITI discovered, they all died in some form of deadly accidents exactly 7 years after the encounter. To make matters worse, SITI also discovered that the same effect also applies to their biological children born after the encounter. The casualties caused by SCP-7497 are much worse than we anticipated. 

Before we look further into this issue, we propose that the following temporary contingency procedure to be included in the handling of SCP-7497:

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
Any civilian who survived an encounter with SCP-7497 and their direct biological descendants born after the encounter are to be registered as E-class personnel, placed under constant Foundation surveillance, and forbidden from leaving the city where the encounter took place without further notice. 
[[/div]]

That will be all. Sorry for the inconvenience caused. Thank you.

Regards,
Nadiya Krishnan
Lead Researcher of Site-612 Information Analytics Department
