From the South it rises, vast, undulating through green forests not yet claimed, its waters paying no heed to frontiers and countries, indifferently witnessing the petty squabbles of man. It flows to the North, towards Kemet, to spill its waters at the delta, to join the great water ruled by trident and salt, echoes of its power reaching the lands beyond the sea, the lands from whence have come generations of conquerors to soak the desert&#39;s sands with blood. 

The sands...

Shift do they with the wind, hiding the vestiges of kingdoms fallen, burying palaces and temples alike, eroding even the memory of ages past. Great kings have tried to tame them, to build their empires of bronze and stone; their tombs now litter the desert, their names uttered solely by poets in remembrance of their demise. 

Nothing prospers on the sands; not men, not empires. To the desert and its gods, all things must bend the knee. All except the River, in whose wake life grows unchallenged, undeterred. 

Here, on black earth made fertile by the River&#39;s infinite generosity, man and beast have found susteneance. Abundant crops feed thousands, an empire born in defiance of the sands. In murky marshes the mighty hippo dwells undisturbed, storks and herons searching for prey under its lazy gaze. In the depths, fish scatter to avoid nets and snares, the shade of passing boats spelling doom for those not fast enough. At the banks, the antelope and the gazelle come to drink. The oxen pace in the grasslands. The ibis hunts the worm. Man builds his cities and lives to see the sun rise. 

For the River bears blessings, for the River gifts life.

[[span class=&#34;serpent&#34;]]//I dreamt a dream that I was awake in the eternal night, my footsteps making ripples in the primordial stillness of the before. Ancient was I at the beginning, the world but a thought in the minds of my kind. Rose the sun from Chaos, to part light from darkness, existence nothing but silence and dust.//

//The Earth stood barren and void. Toil did I to change this sterile land, to seed the sands with life. From my sweat I made the waters, my blessing for the newborn world. Thus was Kemet formed, lush curtains of green lining my passing through the desert.//

//Lord of Fertility I am, generous and wise.// 

//Man came and knew my power, the gratitude I was owed. On my banks they built me sanctuaries, offerings placed at my idols&#39; shade. Evoked by commoner and noble alike, my name was honored, for I am the River and its Source. To me they came for protection, for passage through my domains, to keep them from my children&#39;s jaws. Ma&#39;at I upheld, for civilization to prosper and prevail.//

//But man&#39;s ways are those of ingrates, his memory a fickle thing. They wage their wars on my banks, pollute my waters and dam my path. Centuries have passed; my name is forgotten, my worship lost as Kemet&#39;s tongue dies. My sanctuaries are empty, my temples lie in ruin; none remain who know my rites, whisked away by faiths foreign and unknown.//  

//I am the River and the Source.//

//For ages I have blessed them, fed their people, quenched their thirst. But now they seek to own me, to claim dominion over my currents and my floods. Man forgets his place and, like Pharaoh, thinks himself among the gods.//

//In my image I have birthed beasts, hungry for flesh, thirsty for blood; guardians they are for the River, faithful children bearing my face. Upon men I shall unleash them, until even my waters echo with screams, until the bottom feeders claim their bones. May my spawn feast on a thousand thousand corpses, may flies torment the horse and the ox. Fish shall rot as they are caught, empty nets to bring back home. Crops shall wither under the sun, starving women feeding stillborns with empty breasts. May the River be a place of death and anguish, may sons and daughters cry as they drown.//

//For now, let me slumber, content with dreaming of glories past. I, like my chidren, lie in wait.//

//And behold, the Nile shall run red with blood, and to everywhere it flows my wrath will follow.//

//For I am Sobek, of life and death the Source.//

//All shall return to Chaos.//
