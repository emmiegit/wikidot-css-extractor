[[include component:image-block name=864-new.jpg|caption=SCP-864, manifesting an instance of SCP-864-1]]

**Item #:** SCP-864

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-864 is to be held in a standard containment chamber, located in [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-77| Site-77]]]&#39;s Euclid SCP wing. This chamber is to be kept devoid of any moisture, and inspected once a day to check the seal. During testing, no personnel are to enter the testing area. In the event that articles of clothing manifest, they are to be stored as non-anomalous artifacts. 

**Description:** SCP-864 is a 20 cm tall washbasin with a 10 cm radius, composed of red metal commonly found in washbasins. The words &#34;Made in China&#34; and &#34;Cherry Imperial Goff Applications&#34; are imprinted on the bottom with black ink. No company of that name is found anywhere in China. 

When SCP-864 contains at least 200 ml of water, it will manifest an instance of SCP-864-1. Instances of SCP-864-1 designates a series of appendages which have appeared from SCP-864. Instances of SCP-864-1 may attempt to seize a human subject within their reach, and violently pull them into SCP-864. Instances of SCP-864-1 do not always attempt to take the subjects, with tests showing that the majority of SCP-864-1 instances will make no attempt to attack human subjects. No subjects taken through SCP-864 have been recovered.

Instances of SCP-864-1 known to have manifested include:

* Four human arms, estimated to be 60 cm long. Lurched after a D-class personnel, but were not able to catch him. Retreated into SCP-864 after being engaged by 4 security personnel.
* Humanoid appendages resembling [[[SCP-1193]]]. Did not respond to stimuli and withdrew during SCP-1193&#39;s next activation event.
* Seven black cephalic tentacles approximately 90 cm long and about 10 cm in diameter at the base. Attempted to push SCP-864 on its side, and take several articles of clothing left in the testing chamber. Instance de-manifested on its own.
* Three dark green crustacean pincers, estimated to be 70 cm long. Attempted to drown a D-class personnel until supervising guards managed to free her. Instance retreated after being engaged by Agent Boyd.
* Six segmented mechanical claws, approximately 1 m in length. Seized a D-class personnel and a guard trying to pry the arm loose. Instances folded into SCP-864. 
* Three red cephalic tentacles, estimated to be 3 meters in length. Attempted to seize a D-class personnel, but one instance was severed by a guard with a knife. The two other instances retreated, and the severed portion showed no anomalous properties. 

Testing has shown that SCP-864 extends a distance of 2 kilometers when manifesting an instance of SCP-864-1, after which it terminates in a steel hatch with the words &#34;Black Dragon Co.&#34; embossed in it. Robotic drones sent inside of SCP-864 have found that, while active, the interior is composed entirely of SCP-864-1 instances handling various garments. As of 1/16/2013, approximately 11% of these have been identified as originating from Earth. Of those, only 32 appear to originate from after 1900.
