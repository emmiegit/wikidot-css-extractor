|caption=Digital recreation of a recovered diagram depicting an early design for SCP-6829-A. Weapon systems are not present as this iteration was intended for reconnaissance.]]

**Item #:** SCP-6829

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6829-A is currently kept at Site-18 within a large containment chamber. Further testing with SCP-6829-A has been suspended, and it is to remain deactivated. Counter-intelligence operatives are tasked with discrediting the existence of SCP-6829-A in the public consciousness. Online spaces that host discussions related to SCP-6829-A are to be monitored for disseminating disinformation.

SCP-6829-B is contained on-site in Antarctica within Provisional Site-6829. All personnel are to maintain a minimum distance of 7 m away from the object. Additional support beams have been installed to reinforce the structural integrity of the hangar housing SCP-6829-B. Visual and auditory hallucinations are to be considered normal, and personnel must undergo weekly psychological evaluations.

**Description:** SCP-6829 refers to two objects designated SCP-6829-A and SCP-6829-B.

SCP-6829-A is an experimental aircraft developed during the Second World War by Krupp engineers, and the Ahnenerbe Obskurakorps of Nazi Germany. According to recovered documents from the Reich Ministry of Aviation, it was intended to be an anti-gravity propelled vehicle equipped with anomalous assets under the name Haunebu.[[footnote]] Haunebu is an Ancient Egyptian ethnonym referring to the Sea Peoples between 1200â€“900 BC during the Bronze Age collapse. In their pseudoarchaeological endeavors, the Ahnenerbe believed the Sea Peoples were all Aryans originating from the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2406 Followers of Mekhane] - who they interpreted as &#34;Nordic Dwarves&#34; - in the Aegean Sea. The name Haunebu was selected in reference to an ancient Mekhanite manuscript, which the Ahnenerbe obtained during the Axis occupation of Greece. It alludes to the existence of ancient flying machines, but, as of writing, Foundation archaeologists have yet to discover such vehicles.[[/footnote]] However, numerous delays combined with the conclusion of World War II prevented the completion of the project. SCP-6829-A is believed to be the only prototype in existence.

SCP-6829-A is in the shape of a disc with a sphere at the center, which is where the cockpit is located. The total diameter of the aircraft is 4.2 m wide while the sphere itself is 2.9 m. The interior of the cockpit is circular, and accessible from a hatch on the hull. It was designed to house two pilots who were seated opposite of each other. Parts of its frame are covered in steel panels bolted to it, but many internal components remain exposed. It is equipped with 4 single-mounted MG 131 turrets around the top of the cockpit. In addition, reinforced cameras are attached to each turret that transmit a live visual feed to screens within the cockpit. SCP-6829-A also exhibits 4 retractable landing gear.

SCP-6829-A possesses the following anomalous properties.
* All turrets were connected to an automated targeting system utilizing circuits imbued with thaumaturgical sigils, and a single-chip microprocessor composed of human tissue. A demonic seal[[footnote]] Foundation demonologists identified the seal as belonging to subordinates of the demonic entity known as Belphegor. Further information is available within demonology reports compiled by the Occult Research Division.[[/footnote]] is etched into this component, which generated [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4661 Tartarean Resonance Energy][[footnote]] Tartarean Resonance Energy (TRE) is a type of radiation emitted by demonic entities. [[/footnote]] when the automated system was activated. The system had an accurate firing rate of 90% when locked on targets, but it was incapable of discerning between allies or enemy combatants. To reduce risk of sudden activation and other Tartarean-class activity, an exorcism was performed to disable it.
* The turrets can switch from mundane bullets to a specialized set of ammunition. They resemble standard bullets for the MG 131, except they have a thaumaturgical symbol painted on the casing. When fired they produce large amounts of electrical charge. Upon impact an electromagnetic pulse is generated with an area of effect of approximately 4 m.
* SCP-6829-A is equipped with a bomb bay accessible through an aperture beneath the cockpit. It was intended to drop both anomalous and mundane munitions for bombing runs. One of the munitions designed for this purpose were 3 ceramic bombs covered in thaumaturgical sigils containing rats in a state of suspended animation. They became animate when the ceramic was broken, and it was discovered the rats were infected with a strain of [[[SCP-008]]].[[footnote]]Classified military reports from German and Soviet troops documented small outbreaks of SCP-008 across the Eastern Front. The war had disturbed several dormant G2 sites, but all infected were successfully contained by the two factions. According to the USSR, the most severe outbreak occurred during the Battle of Stalingrad. Further information can be found in Archive 008. [[/footnote]] All recovered specimens were disposed of by incineration.
* Attached to a ceiling compartment within the cockpit, a cylindrical metal tube measuring 15 cm long houses a synthetic crystal wrapped in copper wire. It is connected to a switch that triggers the flow of an electrical current through the wire. Upon receiving the electrical charge, the crystal will refract light in a 5 m radius, rendering SCP-6829-A invisible to observers. While active pilots were unable to see due to a lack of light entering their eyes. The Obskurakorps proposed that pilots should sparingly use the feature to strategically confuse enemy combatants during air combat manoeuvring.
* SCP-6829-A is capable of teleportation in short distances, which is inputted through a computer terminal in the cockpit. However, when activated the pilots did not teleport with SCP-6829-A to the desired location. As a result, subsequent test flights by the Germans were prohibited from using the feature, and it was tested on the ground to minimize potential damages. Foundation researchers were able to verify this flaw with an agent volunteering to be in the cockpit. [[footnote]] Agent â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ received only minor injuries from the subsequent fall onto airbags.[[/footnote]]
* Anti-gravity propulsion and power supply is generated by a bell-shaped device located between the pilots. Various cables are attached to it, and it appears to be seamless. The exact contents of the device are unknown, but it is suspected to be biological in nature. When SCP-6829-A is activated it produces a sound resembling a slow heartbeat, which becomes more rapid during liftoff. In addition, a substance referred to as &#34;Xerum 525&#34; was used for the core, later identified as a mixture of mercury and equine blood. This prompted speculation by researchers that the core is likely to be a variant of a mercury-vortex engine. The resulting anti-gravitational field creates a microgravity environment around the object. However, negative health effects will manifest from prolonged exposure to the anti-gravity bubble within the cockpit. Subjects will most notably exhibit muscle atrophy, and a decrease in bone density over time. Furthermore, the anti-gravity field will eventually begin to expand the longer it remains active, causing all objects in its vicinity to become weightless. It is unknown how far the field can stretch before reaching a limit, but a distance of 16 m was measured before the test was terminated.

SCP-6829-A was recovered on May 1, 1945 at the Tarnewitz research facility near Boltenhagen, Germany.[[footnote]] Tarnewitz was a site dedicated to the development of mundane and anomalous weaponry. Further information regarding the history of the facility can be found under archived files of Operation Hammer. [[/footnote]] It was found in one of the subterranean hangars alongside other anomalous weaponry in development. Various documents were destroyed prior to the arrival of American forces, but some files were able to be salvaged regarding the project. A few alluded to SCP-6829-A being loosely modelled after SCP-6829-B.

SCP-6829-B is a damaged spacecraft of extraterrestrial origin. It is in the shape of an oblate spheroid with a diameter of 5 m, and constructed from a grey colored metal. Thermal imaging reveal it to possess a surface temperature of around 35 Â°C.

In-depth research into SCP-6829-B is currently not possible due to a distorting spatial anomaly surrounding the object. The area of effect ranges up to around 6 m, but it has been observed to fluctuate further by several centimeters. Individuals that attempt to approach the object will experience fatal phenomena such as folding into themselves; merging with the ground and other surrounding objects; body parts being spontaneously relocated away from the subject; or complete disintegration.

Additionally, within approximately 20 m of SCP-6829-B, individuals will experience hallucinations. Personnel will report hearing incomprehensible voices, and witness unidentified objects or loved ones the closer they are to the object. Notably, this effect has been diminishing throughout its history within containment. It was originally recorded to have span over an area of around 50 m. The cause for the decreasing range is unknown.

According to documents from Wewelsburg Castle, SCP-6829-B was recovered in the summer of 1936 after crashing in the Black Forest near Frieberg, Germany. This information is corroborated by a French observatory that noted an object entering the Earth&#39;s atmosphere, but it was dismissed as a meteor at the time. Additionally, the Obskurakorps claimed SCP-6829-B originated from an advance civilization in the Taurus constellation near Aldebaran.[[footnote]] Aldebaran is a star located 65 light-years away from Earth, and it is interpreted as the eye of the Taurus constellation. In 1993, an exoplanet designated Aldebaran b was discovered to be orbiting the star. Coincidentally, it is speculated one of its moons may be able to support extraterrestrial life. Further information can be found under [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/project-heimdall Project Heimdall].[[/footnote]] However, this information is considered unreliable as it cannot be verified, and it is unknown how it was acquired by the organization. Sometime in 1943, SCP-6829-B was transported from Germany to a facility in New Swabia.[[footnote]]New Swabia (German: Neuschwabenland) was territory illegitimately claimed by Nazi Germany in Antarctica following an expedition to the continent in 1938.[[/footnote]][[footnote]] The facility in question has been separately designated as SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ.[[/footnote]] It is kept within an underground hangar isolated from the rest of the complex. Due to the hazardous anomaly surrounding the object it cannot be relocated. As a result, Provisional Site-6829 has been established to monitor it.

**Addendum 01:** The individual responsible for the development of SCP-6829-A was later identified as Arland Schmitz. After the Second World War, Schmitz was acquired by the United States government through Operation Paperclip to develop aircraft for the US Air Force. Under their employ, he aided in the development of SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ and SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ; resulting in the McCarthy-Truman UFO Scandal of 1951, and the Kecksburg UFO Incident of 1965, respectively. The Department of Defense were reluctant to surrender Schmitz over to the Foundation up until his assassination by Soviet GRU agents on February 2, 1953. Memos were recovered from Germany that were written by or addressed to Schmitz regarding SCP-6829-A and -B. They have been translated into English from German. Person of Interest files for all individuals named in these memos can be provided upon request.

We have received the specimen from the Eastern Front. This plague will be a fine addition to Haunebu&#39;s armaments. We began by infecting rats with it. They make for good hosts given their size, and their ability to spread all manner of pestilence.

Unfortunately, a researcher got bitten by one of the awful critters. Of course, we shot him in the head and burned his body as instructed in the reports without further incident. I dare not imagine an outbreak on our fatherland as described by our men at the frontline.

A weapon such as this will be perfect for isolated locations such as Britain. I&#39;m sure the Fuhrer will see the potential devastation we can inflict with it.

The Black Forest vessel is to be transported to New Swabia. It is the safest place given the uncertain future we now face. Commander Karl Reuter will be leading this relocation effort. Have it ready for him.

**Addendum 02:** The following journal entries were retrieved from Provisional Site-6829. Various pages were burnt or torn out, and the author of their contents is unknown. There are no dates on any of the entries, but it is estimated they were written between 1944 to 1956. Extraneous entries not mentioning SCP-6829-B have been omitted.

&gt; The voyage was long, but we have finally arrived to New Swabia. The Antarctic is cold and barren, but the base they built is below that awful surface.
&gt; 
&gt; The strange vehicle we brought with us is now secure in one of the hangars. Commander Reuter told us that it fell from the heavens as a blessing, and our enemies must never have it. Others have brought various machines, and rare Aryan artifacts here.
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully we win the war soon. I cannot send letters from here back home. My sister lost her husband in the front, and her daughter, precious Tulip, became terribly ill recently. I hope for them the best until I can return to Berlin.

&gt; The fool activated it. I saw several men who accompanied him be crushed into the floor or crumbled to dust until nothing was left. It whirred loudly before going silent. None of us can get close to the vehicle now without being killed. Our only hope is for it to lose power. After all, it is just a machine.
&gt; 
&gt; It is a shame this happened for nothing. The snow men[[footnote]] Referring to entities that have been designated as SCP-â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ.Â Â [[/footnote]] were able to successfully fend off the British commandos.[[footnote]] The author is referring to a classified mission carried out by the British Special Air Service under Operation Tabarin in 1945.[[/footnote]] Commander Reuter will be disappointed once he returns.

&gt; I refuse to return to that hangar. Whispers keep coming out of the machine, and I sometimes hear the giggling of my niece. The others agree with me. We&#39;ll close off the hangar for now. There are other problems at hand. A large military force is coming, probably Americans.[[footnote]] The author is referring to Operation Highjump carried out by the United States in 1946-47. It was led by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd with numerous objectives in collaboration with the Foundation.[[/footnote]] We will have to prepare ourselves.

&gt; We all had the same dream last night. There was nothing except an endless void of stars. I felt weightless like I was floating in water. Then I heard a voice I could not understand at first. It spoke some strange language until it eventually began speaking atrocious German that repeated itself. &#34;Return&#34; is what everyone could understand. I kept this to myself, but I also saw Tulip, my niece. She called for me to follow her, and play in her mother&#39;s garden. I now see her sometimes peeking around corners while giggling. Am I going mad? My thoughts do occasionally lie with my family, but they do not feel like they are my own. It is almost like a dream.

&gt; We have lost contact with the //Kindergarten//.[[footnote]]//Kindergarten// (translation: Garden of Children) was the designation for [[[SCP-2936]]].[[/footnote]] Volunteers are going to check on them after the storm passes. Werner wants to go with them to get far away from the hangar. He said maybe he will finally be able to get sleep over there. Perhaps I&#39;ll join him. I&#39;ve been too frightened to sleep for I have nightmares of a terrible red storm.
&gt; 
&gt; @@ @@
&gt; It has been called off. We saw [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2764 something massive] moving out there, and it was in the direction of the //Kindergarten//. The giggling is now louder from that damn hangar. Curse that foul machine.

&gt; Fritz took his own life. We found him in his barracks. His note said he kept hearing his mother and grandmother calling for him to come to the hangar. He also kept writing &#34;return&#34; over and over. We got the crematorium to work for him, but I was unable to stay with the others as he burned. The fire looked too much like her hair.

&gt; We are dead men. There is nowhere to go, and nobody will come for us. Food supply is dwindling after the fire ravaged it. This land is cursed. Tulip keeps tugging at my arm to follow her. She says the hangar with the machine is warm with a beautiful garden. Her mother is also there. Maybe I&#39;ll finally go with Tulip. I&#39;m tired of being cold.

**Addendum 03:** On March 15, â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ, SCP-6829-B released a burst of ionizing radiation.
