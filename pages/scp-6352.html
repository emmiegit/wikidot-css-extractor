**Item:** SCP-6352

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6352 is to be surrounded by a perimeter fence measuring 100m on all sides. 

All public roads have been redirected away from SCP-6352. Cover Story CHM-CNT ‘Chemical Spill Containment Zone’ has been implemented to deter any trespassers from entering SCP-6352. Guards are to patrol the perimeter fence, detain trespassing civilians and hand them over to relevant authorities. No personnel are to enter SCP-6532, with the exception of D-Class for experimentation. All instances of SCP-6532-1 seen leaving SCP-6532 are to be subdued and returned to the premises. 

**Description:** SCP-6352 is also known as [REDACTED] Middle School, Singapore. It is 100m x 100m in area and appears to have up to 4 floors. SCP-6352-1 refers to humanoid entities appearing between the ages of nine and twelve who are found within SCP-6352 and identified as former students of SCP-6352. SCP-6352-1 instances will wander aimlessly around the campus, with a slow and unsteady gait. When engaged, they have been invariably unresponsive. As of ██/██/████, no examples of SCP-6352-1 have escaped from SCP-6352.

Foundation facial recognition software has determined that there are no currently extant records of any SCP-6352-s legal guardians.

SCP-6352 is permeated by SCP-6352-2, a gaseous element with a density of 15kg/m3 that was previously unknown to the periodic table of elements. SCP-6352-2 has not been recorded outside of SCP-6352. 

The source of the SCP-6352 appears to be located in the science lab of the school. 

SCP-6352-2 is colourless and odourless. It currently has not escaped the school compound and has not been recorded elsewhere. Gas masks and oxygen tanks are ineffective at preventing the effects of SCP-6352-2. The following are the effects of inhaling SCP-6352-2:

-Difficulty breathing
-Difficulty speaking 
-Extremely lowered heart rate
-Apparent brain death
-The adoption of a gait similar to SCP-6352-1

Gas masks and oxygen tanks are ineffective to the effects of SCP-6352-2
All effects of SCP-6352-2 cannot be reversed using traditional medicine or chemical treatment.

**Discovery:** On the 21st of August, 2009, at 3:09 pm, the SCP Foundation Telecommunications Monitoring Department intercepted a 999 (emergency) call from Mr ████ Tan (37, Male), a resident of a nearby estate.

**Experiment 6352-A:** Professor █████  instructed two D-Class personnel to enter SCP-6352. Approximately three seconds after entering the premises, the D-Class began to show signs of lowered metabolism, difficulty breathing, light-headedness and drastically decreased heart rate. Five seconds later, subjects entered a state of verbal unresponsiveness and permanent apnea. However, they were still capable of standing up and walking in a haphazard pattern similar to that of SCP-6352-1.
