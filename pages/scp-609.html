**Item #:** SCP-609

**Object Class:** Keter

 **Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-609 is to be stored in individual opaque containers inside a locker at Research Facility 5.-- All personnel must conduct Protocol 94-Wegner-Gyatso before observing any number of SCP-609-1 to ensure a clear and focused mind. Agents who locate instances of SCP-609-1 are to immediately break visual contact until the object is contained. **UPDATE ██/██/██:** SCP-609 has been transferred. It is now to be contained in opaque, locked bins at Storage Site 32.

Because control of SCP-609-1 is highly difficult due to ironic-process theory, only trained researchers with Level 2 Clearance and above are permitted to view it for experimental purposes.

SCP-609-A is to be secured in Storage Locker 11 at Research Facility 5. Viewing the text of SCP-609-A, in whole or in part, requires permission from the head researcher.

**Description:** SCP-609 is a collection of identical green billiard balls in the American pool style which measure 57.15mm in diameter and are believed to exist only as immaterial manifestations of a concept. Instances of SCP-609, designated SCP-609-1, are unbound by physical laws. Each instance is impervious to damage, undetectable except by the naked eye, and unable to conduct heat; instead, they always feel cold to the touch.

SCP-609-1 can be manipulated by thought. When a sapient creature is in direct visual contact with SCP-609-1, it will emulate the actions the user imagines, including motion, duplication, and instantaneous manifestation at a visualized location. Observers cannot alter the physical appearance of SCP-609-1 or erase it from existence.

According to the object&#39;s documentation (SCP-609-A, as described below), SCP-609 is intended to be a literalistic embodiment of Plato&#39;s theory of form. Researchers have conjectured that SCP-609 can be controlled through visualization because SCP-609-1 and the concept of SCP-609-1 are the same object, and that SCP-609-1 cannot be damaged or otherwise mutilated because SCP-609-1 is a manifestation of an immutable metaphysical form.

If multiple observers attempt to activate SCP-609-1 simultaneously, an additional instance of SCP-609-1 will manifest for each observer. As a result of its thought-activated replication, SCP-609 has proliferated under Foundation custody. See Document 609-A for current estimates.

When SCP-609-1 is relocated to or generated in an area outside of the viewer&#39;s visual range, a recovery mission is required to resume full containment of SCP-609. Locations from which SCP-609-1 have been recovered include: 

* The Research Facility 5 kitchen
* The Research Facility 5 second-floor bathroom
* The apartment of Researcher █████████, on top of a television
* A warehouse in Pasadena where SCP-████ had been recently located
* The set of television series [REDACTED]. Breach occurred during a taping; all footage of the event was confiscated and amnestics were administered to all witnesses.
* The frontal lobe of Assistant Researcher ██████
* The mammary tissue of Researcher ██████████
* Earth&#39;s moon (currently unrecoverable).

SCP-609 was recovered with a yellow box believed to be its packaging. The box is labeled &#34;DR. WONDERTAINMENT&#39;S ONTOLOGICAL 6-BALL™&#34; in large text, although the typography differs in comparison to other products recovered from the same manufacturer. Smaller graphics below the title depict a marble bust of Plato with a speech balloon that says &#34;IT REALLY EXISTS!&#34; and an unidentified grinning woman exclaiming &#34;NOW SUBJECT TO CAUSALITY!&#34; A green pool ball is visible inside through a cellophane window.

The following text is printed on the back:

&gt; Hey, kids! Have you ever wondered whether your experiences are fully authentic or if only your thoughts are real and the world around you is a web of lies? Now the question is **immaterial**! With your new ONTOLOGICAL 6-BALL™, you can use your imagination to make the hottest new learning toy that **cannot not be**!
&gt; 
&gt; * IT **FLOATS**! Send it into the air with your THOUGHT POWER™!
&gt; 
&gt; * IT **FLIES**! Did you think it could only float without moving? You should be SARTRE than that!
&gt; 
&gt; * IT CAN GO **ANYWHERE**! Think real hard of any place fun times can be had. Ontological 6-Ball™ is probably there already!
&gt; 
&gt; * IT **POSSESSES THE HIGHEST AND MOST FUNDAMENTAL KIND OF REALITY**! All other objects which share its form are imperfect reflections of its ultimate truth!
&gt;  
&gt; Did you create it, or did it create you? Don&#39;t put DESCARTES™ before the horse! If you don&#39;t think this is the grooviest toy out there, **[http://www.scp-wiki.net/and-this-one-explains-humes HUME] MUST BE JOKING!**
&gt; 
&gt; ,,Caution: Some assembly required. Dr. Wondertainment assumes no liability for injuries, accidents, or existential nausea caused by physical or intellectual misuse of Ontological 6-Ball™.  Dr. Wondertainment does not endorse solipsism, and any Ominous Implications™ that result from use of Ontological 6-Ball™ are not views shared by Dr. Wondertainment. Ontological 6-Ball™ is not beholden to spacetime. Ontological 6-Ball™ cannot be forgotten or unlearned.,,

No copyright date, retail sticker, or other identifying information is present on the packaging. The package was not intended to contain SCP-609-1; the object seen through the cellophane window is a paper display insert designed to simulate a billiard ball. Instead, the object designated SCP-609-A is enclosed.

SCP-609-A is a cognitohazardous 32-page booklet titled &#34;Dr. Wondertainment&#39;s Ontological 6-Ball™ Assembly Guide.&#34; The first page consists of a disclaimer:

&gt; CAUTION: Make sure to read all instructions and warnings before assembling or operating Ontological 6-Ball™. Inadequate, modified, or otherwise improper assembly of Ontological 6-Ball™ may result in undesired functions. If Ontological 6-Ball™ begins to surround you to the exclusion of everything else, making you feel confused, lonely, and like the only thing you can ever be sure of is the Ontological 6-Ball™, stop playing and take a break. By possessing Ontological 6-Ball™ or any included material, including knowledge of the existence of Ontological 6-Ball™, you agree to accept all liability for consequences, accidental or metaphysically inherent, of Ontological 6-Ball™, and also consent that Ontological 6-Ball™ will always be a fundamental part of who you are.
&gt; 
&gt; **HAVE FUN!**

The remaining pages contain comprehensive instructions on &#34;assembling&#34; SCP-609-1 through careful, directed thought. Printed in 6-point type with no illustrations, the booklet describes in exhaustive detail the appearance, construction, physical properties and behavior, cultural significance and symbolism, and other aspects of a pool ball made in America ca. the 1970s, as related by someone in a state of severe mental distress. 

Test subjects who read SCP-609-A in its entirety have demonstrated the ability to generate SCP-609-1 through concentration. Although amnestic therapy is ineffective in reversing this effect, it can erase knowledge of the ability from subjects&#39; minds, generally eliminating its use unless the subject is somehow informed or reminded of the ability (through, for example, viewing a pool table, a spherical object, the color green, or the number 6).
