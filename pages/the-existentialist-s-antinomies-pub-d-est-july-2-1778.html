&gt; The era of the enlightenment is a period of history that will forever remain immortalized as the birth of reason, and can be easily traced to all modern societal structures, with the birth of the social contract and sophisticated philosophy as a whole being born. Among the well-known, such as Rousseau, Kent, Locke, Kant, Cartman, Toland, edc. come to mind, however many forget Jillesque de la Fontaine. After The Sundering of north east Eurengland, many of the scholar’s works were destroyed. Few remain, though, and his most famous work, The Existentialist&#39;s Antinomies, reads as follows, thoroughly updated to be topical and fit modern grammar reforms by yours truly, Tititictilitics, for your reading enjoyment. Bon appétit.

Some hells are of man&#39;s own making, some self-projected and imposed. The argument of nature versus nurture has always puzzled me in this
sense. Are we born to be miscible, or are misery and malice learned concepts? In a vacuum, would one be lonely who never knew of other men? Would a dumb man crave to hear as a blind man wishes to see? 

Humans are the same; they have enough cognition to understand that material value is fleeting, death is approaching, and natural laws of transactional value are a force that will crush us in existential truths.

As the dumb man wishes to hear, the living may never know death. 

Death is unavoidable, all-consuming, and will find everyone and everything we love, as death is a human concept.

Can anything indeed die?

Following laws set by men like Antoine Lavoisier, matter can not be created or destroyed. 

Every man has always been and will always be spread between cosmic infinity and in this moment. Our bones are made of dead stars; sinuses are built from the flesh of others. 

This transactional power is a natural law on its own.

Humans differ from all other beings for one reason: a need to be individual.

We all share a finite amount of transactional power in this world, yet we deny transactional power. Death cleanses individuality. We rot, join all other life, and live on immortal, leaving our bodies to be consumed and our legacy immortal as time.

Accepting that you are already decaying and one day you will be indistinguishable and change form is dread. Dread is discomforting, and the unknown even more so. That is why we fill our bodies with poisons and place ourselves in boxes, not to protect the outside from us but to ensure that transactional power does not claim our bodies. It is selfish to deny nature when greed takes you as far as to burn your body away in a fire so hot that all that remains is wood ash and fragments of bone.

By committing this post-mortem mutilation of self, you rob the world of one of the few eternal things man possesses. Death is essential to life. Death gives life meaning. 

To this extent, death is life.

Your body may rot away but do not fear. Rot gives time transactional power. Dance at every opportunity, laugh until you cry, and cry until you laugh. Live each day passionately, love the moment, and embrace the next with open arms.</textarea></pre>
