**Item #:** SCP-246

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-246 is to be kept in a wooden crate within Site-██&#39;s secure storage. Researchers who requisition its use for experimentation are responsible for their own room arrangements. SCP-246 is otherwise not to be removed from its container, especially for recreational use.

**Description:** SCP-246 is a 16-millimeter film projector. When activated, SCP-246&#39;s projection lamp lights up and the reels begin turning. When the projector is pointed at a screen or other white surface, a film appears, even though SCP-246&#39;s film (hereafter referred to as SCP-246-01) does not pass in front of the projection lamp. 

The film feeder has been welded shut, making any attempt to load SCP-246-01 into the second reel impossible. Requests to cut through or replace the feeder have been denied, due to the possibility of inadvertently breaking SCP-246.  Examination of SCP-246-01 suggests that it is blank while inert, though high-speed photography shows images on the film when SCP-246 is in its active state. Analysis of these images is underway. When replaced with any other roll of 16 mm film, SCP-246 continues functioning as described below. After using SCP-246 with a reel other than SCP-246-01, that reel exhibits similar properties to SCP-246-01. Microspectrometer analysis of reels made blank by SCP-246-01 has shown anomalous forms of [REDACTED]. Further analysis by Foundation researchers other than Dr. ██████ is not permitted.

Despite SCP-246-01&#39;s content or lack thereof, when activated, SCP-246 projects a short film in the style of 1950s educational films.

SCP-246 seems to have a limited degree of awareness, as a female D-class subject was shown a film entitled &#34;So You&#39;re Not Going to Live Very Long!&#34;. Shortly afterwards, she was terminated at the end of the month as per procedure. An introverted D-class subject ██████-██ (despite previous convictions for [REDACTED]) was shown &#34;Three Easy Ways to Remove ████████&#34;, a film explaining tools and techniques for home surgery, and was subsequently terminated after his attempt to use a toothbrush as a surgical instrument. That night, Dr. ████████, employed as a surgeon before the Foundation [DATA EXPUNGED] and who had supervised ██████-██, attempted to follow the film&#39;s advice.

He was found dead the next day, ████████ and viscera scattered on the floor around him. Further experimentation resulted in the films &#34;Digestive Systems of Woodland Creatures&#34;, &#34;Three Handy Tips for Handling Amputation&#34;, and &#34;Sightless Eyes: Dealing with Total Paralysis&#34;, which involved graphic descriptions of stroke victims&#39; slow death by starvation before being found by relatives. All subjects suffered the described afflictions shortly after exposure to SCP-246. 

Researchers are therefore discouraged from following SCP-246&#39;s directions, and to report any urges to activate SCP-246 to their research supervisor.
