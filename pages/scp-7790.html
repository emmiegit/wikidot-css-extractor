**{{Special Containment Procedures:}}** SCP-7790 is currently contained within an HS3-Class[[footnote]]Highly Secured, Subterranean and Secluded.[[/footnote]] containment locker at Site-94. Access to the anomaly&#39;s containment chamber is limited to Level 5 personnel authorized by a member of the O5 Council.

**{{Description:}}** SCP-7790 denotes the remains of a humanoid automaton of unknown origin, most of which was previously located within an abandoned factory in Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska.

SCP-7790 is partially functional. At random times, the anomaly will become active and simultaneously do the following before deactivating:

* Broadcast a series of radio transmissions through its speakers;
* Spontaneously manifest and demanifest a set of unrelated objects within a 100m radius;
* Violently rub the floor with its feet.

SCP-7790&#39;s back is heavily damaged, although the word &#34;DIVISION&#34; can still be seen visibly burned onto its surface.

(//A female voice can be heard.//)

{{**[00:00]** -- &#34;Howard.&#34;}}

(//Silence.//)

{{**[00:04]** -- &#34;Howard. The scalpel, please. There&#39;s a lot of that nasty, white gunk again.&#34;}}

(//A metallic clink is heard, followed by a wet sound. A muffled scream is heard in the background.//)

{{**[00:13]** -- &#34;Okay, that&#39;s a smooth cut. I think we&#39;re done with the mouth here.&#34;}}

{{**[00:23]** -- &#34;First day&#39;s the hardest, right? You&#39;ll get used to it. Just give me a hand and you&#39;ll eventually get the hang of this.&#34;}}

(//A loud click is heard.//)

{{**[00:44]** -- &#34;Jesus Christ. Those dirty eyeballs are full of calcium and roots.&#34;}}

(//Silence.//)

{{**[01:34]** -- &#34;Thank you. You&#39;re learning fast.&#34;}}

(//Rustling paper is heard.//)

(//A chuckle is heard. Following this, a deep-voiced man is heard talking.//)

{{**[00:12]** -- &#34;Super... Superkale... I- Uh. What was I saying?&#34;}}

(//The sound of rain is heard. The storm is intense.//)

{{**[00:20]** -- &#34;It... It was a word. Supercalifornia? No, no. It&#39;s much more lively than that. Not so American.}}

(//Ripping paper is heard, followed by a dripping sound.//)

{{**[00:34]** -- &#34;It&#39;s... It was Polish. Or Finnish, I think.&#34;}}

{{**[00:43]** -- &#34;Superhaltist. Suprafragalta. Soupstone. What... What was it?&#34;}}

(//The man begins to slowly hyperventilate.//)

(//A high-pitched, animated woman begins speaking.//)

{{**[00:57]** -- &#34;...ocious! Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious, if you say it loud enough you&#39;ll always sound precocious! Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!&#34;}}

(//The female voice from before can be heard.//)

{{**[01:13]** -- &#34;I&#39;m impressed you couldn&#39;t remember something like this, after so much time. Especially when this is not your first day.&#34;}}

(//A female voice can be heard.//)

{{**[00:01]** -- &#34;Most of the job is repetition. Once we&#39;ve developed concrete protocol, we just continue using it.&#34;}}

(//Static plays.//)

{{**[00:08]** -- &#34;Thinking doesn&#39;t enter in the picture. Only repetition and procedures do, because thinking doesn&#39;t produce anything. For example, you need to sign your name right now.&#34;}}

{{**[00:15]** -- &#34;Eventually we&#39;ll fully automate it, like in that Harlan Ellison story. But for now, we&#39;re stuck with you. And that means you&#39;ve got to learn.&#34;}}

(//Static plays.//)

{{**[00:26]** -- &#34;Learn to numb yourself, not think, turn off your brain, autopilot, whatever you want to call it. Figuring out how to turn your eyes and brain to ash and how to forget that a child has a life. Living in an infinite present without context or morality, sociology, ethics, temporality. All of those words are made up things and just learn to ignore them.&#34;}}

{{**[00:45]** -- &#34;Even learning to ignore the pain. Because pain is another one of those things. It&#39;s made up. And because there&#39;s no room for humanity while on the job.&#34;}}

(//Static plays.//)

{{**[00:49]** -- &#34;It&#39;s not too hard. All you need to do is to sign your name on the dotted line.&#34;}}

(//Silence.//)

{{**[00:58]** -- &#34;Yes, I know about your fingers. What do you want me to do about it?&#34;}}

(//A female voice can be heard.//)

{{**[00:01]** -- &#34;So, let&#39;s go down to the next interview question. This is an optional one, but ...&#34;}}

{{**[00:04]** -- &#34;Do you believe in... God? Jesus? Allah? Whatever you call it.&#34;}}

{{**[00:22]** -- &#34;That&#39;s quite concerning.&#34;}}

{{**[00:28]** -- &#34;Like, uh. We have to believe in something. That&#39;s just how nature works.&#34;}}

{{**[00:31]** -- &#34;Because... You know. There&#39;s always something watching over something. Caring for something.&#34;}}

(//A loud thump is heard.//)

{{**[00:37]** -- &#34;A mother watching over her baby. An engineer watching over his machines. A dictator watching over his people.&#34;}}

(//Silence.//)

{{**[00:40]** -- &#34;...I watch over you.&#34;}}

(//Short pause.//)

{{**[00:44]** -- &#34;Isn&#39;t it fascinating? I mean, it sounds kinda wholesome. It also is... To know that we&#39;re all the same in some way. A leech not being different from a human mind, soul and body; a mass of maggots gnawing over a corpse, not being different from a city full of human people? It&#39;s... It&#39;s engaging, in a way. So, uh... What was I saying before?&#34;}}

(//Silence. The man begins hyperventilating.//)

{{**[00:52]** -- &#34;Uhm. Right.&#34;}}

(//Long pause. The sound of a burning fire resonates in the background.//)

(//The female continues.//)

{{**[00:55]** -- &#34;You need to believe in something. For your own good.&#34;}}

{{**[00:59]** -- &#34;Because there&#39;s something above, that needs to be believed in. In exchange for its care, and its love.&#34;}}

(//Silence.//)

{{**[01:04]** -- &#34;A god loves his church, and, uh... I hope you know where I&#39;m going, uh huh. Yeah, I&#39;ve done so much for you.&#34;}}

(//Chittering can be heard. The woman continues.//)

{{**[01:10]** -- &#34;I can be that something you... You never had. You know?&#34;}}

(//More silence.//)

{{**[01:14]** -- &#34;Just don&#39;t think all I&#39;m saying is a fetish or something. It&#39;s more normal than you&#39;d think.&#34;}}
