**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7161 is to be kept in a 3x3x3 meter concrete cell with soundproof walls, soundproofing of the room is to be checked and maintained regularly. Only during testing will personnel be allowed inside SCP-7161&#39;s cell. 

All staff who enter SCP-7161&#39;s cell are to be given an immediate psychological evaluation before returning to regular duties. D-Class personnel who listen to any stories told by SCP-7161 are to be interviewed and immediately taken back to their holding cells. These D-Class are to be monitored overnight to document anomalous activity.


**Description:** SCP-7161 is a porcelain ventriloquist doll approximately 1 meter in height. The doll has chalk-white skin with several notable cracks around its exterior. The left eye appears missing while the other features a black sclera and red iris. The doll wears a black tuxedo with a white shirt and black bow tie. Several red marks can be seen on the suit. Data analysis has found the red substance to in fact be human blood, the exact origin of this blood is as of yet unknown. 

The doll, who refers to himself as Henry, speaks in a slightly distorted voice. The language spoken depends on who he is speaking to and he seems capable of speaking any known language. When subjects enter the cell Henry will engage in conversation and friendly banter before asking if the subject would like to hear a story. 

Upon accepting this request Henry will recount an often incredibly disturbing or frightening story. Most often these stories will include Henry speaking for characters in voices other than his base tone. These voices seem to have an extreme range with seemingly no type of voice he cannot mimic repeatedly. He has even mimicked the voices of Research staff during escape attempts. 

However, it seems since testing with SCP-7161 has started, all attempts at escaping containment have ceased. Those who listen to SCP-7161&#39;s stories are transported to a pocket dimension seemingly controlled by SCP-7161. 

Knowledge of this pocket dimension is limited with only one recorded description, which calls it a semi-flat, gray, sandy desert-like area with various misshapen structures composed of a material similar to porcelain. Attempts to retrieve subjects from this pocket dimension have been unsuccessful.

&gt; **Interviewed:** SCP-7161
&gt;
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. █████ Pierce
&gt;
&gt; **SCP-7161:** Hello, doctor.
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Pierce:** I’ll be damned, you do talk.
&gt;
&gt; **SCP-7161:** Oh, you would be surprised with how many things I do -- if you listen closely.
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Pierce:** So what exactly are you?
&gt;
&gt; **SCP-7161:** It’s quite obvious isn&#39;t it? I&#39;m just a doll, dear doctor -- you can call me Henry.
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Pierce:** Alright then, Henry, is that blood on your suit?
&gt;
&gt; **SCP-7161:** Unfortunate accidents, I can assure you. Not everyone is so polite when offering them a simple story.
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Pierce:** And your stories, what are they?
&gt;
&gt; **SCP-7161:** Think of it as a window that only I can look through. On the other side I see such wonderfully horrible things in all sorts of places, some here, some very…very far away.
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Pierce:** And you tell people about what you see.
&gt;
&gt; **SCP-7161:** Of course, what&#39;s a good story if it&#39;s not shared with all those who will hear it? Though there is always a cost to such knowledge…
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Pierce:** These people you tell the stories to, where do they go?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. SCP-7161:** I&#39;m afraid that isn&#39;t information I’m at liberty to share.
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Pierce:** Where do they go, damn it?!
&gt;
&gt; **[SCP-7161 remains silent]**
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Pierce:** Subject refuses to answer further questions, return SCP-7161 to containment.

**Addendum 7161.2: Audio Logs**

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Audio Logs: 10/5/22-5/8/24&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

The following are audio logs recorded by D-7698. D-7698 was equipped with an audio recording device for this exploration. Once the anomalous teleportation had occurred, D-7698 appeared in an extra-dimensional plane. This disappearance occured around 47 minutes after listening to a story from SCP-7161.
&gt;
&gt; &#34;Well, they told me to take note of anything I could about where I ended up, and I&#39;m not gonna lie -- it&#39;s kinda fuckin&#39; hard. There&#39;s not much even here, as far as I can see it&#39;s just a flat, gray, sandy-ass wasteland. I think I see some buildings in the distance; I&#39;m going to go investigate.&#34;
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; &#34;Made it to the buildings and I&#39;ll be damned! There are actually people out here! Some of them are D-Class like me but a lot of them are just regular civilians. How many people are trapped in here?&#34;
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; &#34;Seems some of the people here have been here awhile, they managed to hole up in this town. It&#39;s got 10, maybe 15 buildings total but something is strange about them. The construction doesn&#39;t make any sense. It&#39;s like if you got an ape or a kid to try and make houses, they look just like houses you&#39;d see normally but they&#39;re just...off, I guess. Supports in random spots that don&#39;t seem to support anything, doors with misshapen knobs. But the strangest of all is the material, it feels almost like...porcelain mixed with wood.&#34;
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; &#34;It&#39;s the strangest thing, looking out into the distance the building placement seems almost random, old stores, broken down houses, it&#39;s like a bunch of buildings from a bunch of different places just got put here at random. Weirdly enough the house the doll mentioned in the story he told me is here, looks damn near crystal clear to his description. My story was about some kid finding a messed copy of Mario and playing it at his house and and I&#39;ll be damned it looks dead to rights identical. Maybe that&#39;s what this place is? Just an amalgamation of all the places from the fuckin stories he told all of us.&#34;
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; &#34;Looked inside the house from my story and it looks exactly like what I saw in my head while he was telling the story to me, down to the NES sitting next to the old ass TV, it&#39;s all made of that same porcelain stuff though. It&#39;s like all the buildings and stuff are just props he uses for his stories, them once he&#39;s done he just plops them out here. The stories... hell our lives... It&#39;s all just part of a big game to him.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;It&#39;s been about a week since my last log and I&#39;ve gotten to know some of the people here. This old fella William, says he found that fuckin&#39; doll in an old warehouse. Just like the rest of us he fell for that thing&#39;s trick, got told a story about a picture of a dog that would drive people nuts and then kill &#39;em. Sounds ridiculous to me but, apparently, it scared him quite a bit. He was walking to pick up his grandkids from school the next day when poof, just like that he woke up here. We find supplies every once in a while in old buildings here which seems to be enough to keep us alive as long as we ration it. But this town alone has got around 15-20 people so &#34;limited supply of food&#34; is the understatement of the century.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;Me and Will are heading out on a scouting trip to try and find more supplies. Will&#39;s old, but he&#39;s one tough son of a bitch hehe...I&#39;ll keep the log updated if we find anything.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;We found a convenience store-looking place. It&#39;s made out of that same weird porcelain wood material as the houses but hey, there are still supplies inside. We found some food and water and the best part is we don&#39;t even gotta pay. The only thing at the checkout desk is a porcelain mannequin thing, doesn&#39;t seem like he&#39;s up to anything. Damn thing must have been here a lot of time, there&#39;s enough dust on it to make a sand castle, haha.&#34;
&gt;
&gt; [The sounds of breaking porcelain are heard]
&gt;
&gt; &#34;Hey Will did you hear that-&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;Shit! Shit! Shit! We pissed that thing off. I gotta whisper, I think it&#39;s right outside... We managed to get away and hole up in this old shack, but it&#39;s gonna find us eventually. I found a rock buried in the sand. I think if I can sneak up on it I can kill the fucking thing with the rock. If you don&#39;t hear from me again then I&#39;m probably splattered on the sand.&#34;
&gt; 

&gt; **Note:** Mannequin entities described in logs have been given the designation SCP-7161-A
&gt;

&gt; &#34;We did it... We fucking did it, haha! I know I&#39;m out of breath, but that&#39;s because it took damn near an hour of swinging that rock at its head before it finally stopped moving... Jesus this thing is a piece of work. 
&gt; 
&gt; It looks the same as it did standing at the desk at the store, but it&#39;s completely busted. The joints are cracked, probably to allow it to move. Good lord, its face... The jaw looks ripped open, with some shards of porcelain that act like teeth. 
&gt; 
&gt; If this is the kind of shit running around in here then our chances of survival just dropped, especially if we have to face more than one. We&#39;re gonna head back to town with the supplies and try to figure out a strategy to go forward. If we can&#39;t escape them we&#39;re gonna have to find out how to keep those things from getting into town.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;Will cut his hand on it while we were moving the body. It doesn&#39;t look bad but I don&#39;t know what kind of bacteria lives out here. We&#39;re just gonna do our best to keep it clean with some water and hope for the best.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;We made it back to town in one piece. I&#39;m gonna get everyone together for a meeting to discuss how to move forward and see what we can do to fortify this place. I just hope Will pulls through.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;We were in the middle of the meeting when Will... He just...I can&#39;t even describe it! We heard this cracking sound and all of a sudden Will started screaming... Within a matter of seconds, his entire body turned into fucking porcelain! The cracking sound kept going until he shattered! What the fuck is this place! What the fuck is going on!&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;We buried what we could gather of Will outside the main house... It still doesn&#39;t even feel real. He didn&#39;t deserve that, he was a good man... I swear if I ever get out of here I&#39;m going to kick that damn doll&#39;s head in.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;We&#39;ve got a plan. We&#39;re going to take some of the buildings people aren&#39;t using apart and use them to make walls around the town. That way at least we&#39;ll have a chance if those things come for us.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;It&#39;s been about 3 weeks and the walls are finished. We&#39;ve only had to deal with the mannequins two other times while people were out on scouting trips for supplies. Same story -- it looks normal but as soon as you get too damn close to it they go ape shit. We&#39;ll try to keep it in mind for future ventures.&#34;
&gt; 

&gt; &#34;Will&#39;s body...or at least what was left of it, is gone, the hole we buried it in is wide open and there&#39;s nothing inside. I don&#39;t even want to know what in the hell that means for us.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;Nobody even seems to care about escaping anymore. According to some of the people who&#39;ve been here the longest they&#39;ve tried damn near everything -- can&#39;t dig down because the sand is too damn thick, can&#39;t walk out because the desert keeps going... According to them, nobody has ever made it out and after hearing that, I doubt anyone ever will.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;I saw him in my dreams, that damn doll called &#39;Henry&#39;. He just laughed at me... He was looking down on all of us like a kid playing with Legos and laughing like hell. Either I&#39;m going crazy which seems like an ever-growing possibility the longer I stay here, or that&#39;s exactly what is happening. The doll is fucking toying with us in his sick little world. If anyone can hear me, for the love of God... Help us...&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;Someone pissed off a big group of mannequins and they ended up leading them back here.  Safe to say the wall works; we were able to hold them off long enough to toss rocks down and kill the damn things. We killed at least 5 and 3 others ran off back into the desert. No casualties this time, but the person who led them back got a nice shiny metaphorical boot up his ass by yours truly. We gotta be more careful moving forward.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;We found Will&#39;s body, he&#39;s one of them now... We walked outside this morning only to find a perfect mannequin shaped just like him. We managed to throw it outside the wall before it woke up and tried getting back in, but we didn&#39;t have the heart to kill it... I know that&#39;s stupid and I know it&#39;s not him anymore but God damn it I just...I just couldn&#39;t do it... He ran off into the desert not long after. Is that what all of them are? Poor bastards just like us who got stuck here just like us. I don&#39;t want to think about that right now.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;A scouting team came back and they found something: more people, 3 of them, more D-Class. They all say they showed up here a few days ago and have been wandering the desert. We got them cleaned up and set up with a place to sleep for now. We need all the hands we can get, so this is honestly a blessing.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;This ex-military type named Thomas is working on making catapults on top of the walls to hurl whatever heavy things we can find at the mannequins before they can even get to the walls. I don&#39;t know how practical it&#39;s going to be but hey, it&#39;s worth a shot.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;We lost another person to the mannequins yesterday. This kid, maybe 19, was out on a scouting mission when he woke some of them up by accident. He didn&#39;t make it halfway back to the wall before he got ripped to shreds... They didn&#39;t even eat him or anything, they just ripped him apart and threw his guts across the sand. I recognized one of the mannequins, and it seems Will didn&#39;t go too far after we threw him out.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;It must be months I&#39;ve been stuck here. Looking at these logs, I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s close to a year. How funny is that? I&#39;ve been here a whole goddamn year and I still don&#39;t even know where &#34;here&#34; is. 
&gt; 
&gt; To whatever egghead lab coat is listening to these, fuck you. You keep giving that doll exactly what he wants, more toys. You send more and more people in here for what? More tests? I don&#39;t even think you know anymore. Hell, I wish I never agreed to this test. Sure, you&#39;d have shot me but hey, that seems pretty pleasant compared to living in this gray sandy dollhouse shithole any longer. 
&gt; 
&gt; What did I even do, huh? I stole cars, were you that desperate to throw people in orange jumpsuits?! I repeat -- I stole fucking cars! I didn&#39;t kill anybody! I didn&#39;t even lay a hand on anybody! I hotwired cars I found in fucking alleyways and this! This is my punishment?! Oh, you&#39;re just trying to keep the world safe? Kiss my ass.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;The town has grown since I got here. We took apart old buildings we found in the wastes and used the material to make new houses here. More people keep showing up -- we must have at least 50 at this point. All of them with the same story -- different crimes, all ended up in orange jumpsuits, got sent in for testing, talked to a doll, heard a story and a few minutes or hours later, bang! Dropped off at the edge of who-knows-where with all of us sorry assholes. At least that means more manpower to hold off the mannequins.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;We&#39;ve seen it from a distance. It&#39;s a pack of them, must be at least 70, maybe even 80 mannequins travelling the desert together. The wall is strong but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s that strong. They seem to be keeping their distance for now, but I don&#39;t know how long it&#39;ll stay that way.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;We took out some from a distance with the catapults and thinned out the group a little. If they didn&#39;t know we were here before they sure as shit do now. We&#39;re preparing for an all-out war at this point because if that wall goes down we&#39;re all screwed.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;They&#39;re coming, we see them in the distance and they&#39;re closing in. They stop at buildings on the way and wake even more mannequins up; must be how this pack got so big. They&#39;re maybe a day&#39;s distance out and closing in fast. This is it.&#34;
&gt;

&gt; &#34;They broke through... *Cough* *Cough* Some of us managed to get away, at least 20 people escaped but not me. I&#39;m barricaded in the main house... And I know I&#39;m not making it out of here. I can hear them outside ripping through homes like tissue paper. They&#39;ll come for me soon enough, hell one of &#39;em already took a pretty big chunk out of my shoulder *Cough*. If anyone from the Foundation is hearing this... Kill that fucking doll!&#34;
&gt;

&gt; **Note:** It was around 2 days after these events must have occurred that the audio log recorder was found clutched in SCP-7161&#39;s arms. When asked, the doll&#39;s only comments were that it was, quote &#34;Fun while it lasted&#34;. All tests relating to SCP-7161 have been postponed until audio logs have been analyzed fully.
