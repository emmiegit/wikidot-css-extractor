Act 2, Scene 2:

James: //(Crying)// But can&#39;t they help you in some way?

Butt ghost: There is no cure for butt cancer.

J: But what will I do without you?

BG: James, you&#39;ve never needed me in the first place

J: What do you mean?

BG: Inside of you lies the power, not me. I&#39;m only a spirit that haunts the posteriors of mammals.

J: I can&#39;t let you go.

BG: You already have. //(Gestures to the framed photo of James with his arm wrapped around a yield sign.)//

J: It&#39;s not what you think!

BG: No, it&#39;s what I know.

J: But butt ghost...

BG: Shh, don&#39;t speak. You&#39;ve broken my heart enough already.

J: I can&#39;t let you go.

BG: You had no trouble letting your //other women// go!

J: That was years ago, Butt Ghost!

BG: A butt ghost never forgets.

J: You forgot me once.

BG: I had to go soul-searching, James.

J: And what did you find?

BG: I found my spirit place. The air was still and the water was cool. I felt a presence. I turned to look, but no one was there. I was alone. The moon overhead gazed down at my prone body. I felt nothing and everything at once. And that&#39;s when I realized, my people need me.

J: Ankle ghost will be fine.

BG: It&#39;s not just Ankle Ghost anymore, James, it&#39;s the world.

J: What does that even mean?

BG: They&#39;re revoking ghost licenses everywhere now.

J: No!

BG: It&#39;s true.

J: But what about your estranged relationship with your brother?

BG: Ghost Butt will either have to get out of my way, or join me.

J: How?

BG: James, you know me too well to question my ability in dealing with these issues.

J: Very well. I can only hope you don&#39;t fail.

BG: Failure is not an option.

J: Good luck.

BG: Thank you.

J: Here take this. (Passes plunger)

BG: I will not let you down.

J: Goodbye, Butt Ghost. //(Salutes)//

BG: Goodbye, James. //(Flushes)//
