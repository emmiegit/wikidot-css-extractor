&gt; Dear All Of You Money-Grubbing, Arrogant, Sycophantic, Empty-Skulled, Lying, Poorly-Animated Asslickers, Especially Freddy &#34;Fucking Backstabbing Judas&#34; Fox And Kenny &#34;Never Worked A Day In His Sexless Life&#34; Crow:
&gt; 
&gt; Well, you finally done it! Great job, you broke me. You broke me enough to bash down my door until this piece of paper turned up in my bed. I&#39;d give you the &#34;if you&#39;re reading this, I&#39;m dead&#34; business and say my tearful goodbyes to you hateful sons of bitches, but what would you say to that? &#34;Daaaah, why is he still using a typewriter in 2016, Paddy needs to give up on letter-writing, it&#39;s even worse than his shitty cartoon acting, I mean, it&#39;s not like I could do any better if I tried twice as hard as Paddy has been trying all his life, but I&#39;m gonna go ahead and make Paddy&#39;s life a dick-in-the-garbage-disposal party because I&#39;m about as smart as a dixie cup full of gatorade!&#34; You can all go fuck yourselves forever and ever. 
&gt; 
&gt; Don&#39;t worry about revenge. I&#39;m gonna let you live your sugar-coated plastic imitation cheddar lifespans as long as you want, being the grease-drenched toxic gorilla rabies shitstains you are. That&#39;s more than enough punishment. I wouldn&#39;t wish it on Hitler, or even Super Hitler. 
&gt; 
&gt; There is someone I&#39;m gonna completely fuck up before I stick a Remington up my nose, but unlike you, they&#39;re a smart enemy. They&#39;re a patient enemy. They&#39;re an enemy that doesn&#39;t lie through their teeth and call me their &#34;friend.&#34; They&#39;re the ones that call us [[[SCP-2835]]]. Wanna know more about that? I fucked your mom.
&gt; 
&gt; And when you die scared and alone, and find yourselves in the pitch-dark corner of hell reserved for weaklings, I&#39;ll be the first one to shit caustic misery down your throat. I will torture you in ways that haven&#39;t even been invented yet. I will piss on your graves, around your graves, in your graves, and in your coffins, until your skeleton is a fucking piss pickle. You will gargle your screams through your boiling entrails until the last star goes black and all the Universe is cold and quiet.
&gt; 
&gt; And before I forget, 
&gt; 
&gt; REAP WHAT YOU SOW REAP WHAT YOU SOW REAP WHAT YOU SOW
&gt; REAP WHAT YOU SOW REAP WHAT YOU SOW REAP WHAT YOU SOW
&gt; REAP WHAT YOU SOW REAP WHAT Y

The typewriter keys fell silent. With a shaking wing, Paddy Pelican took a long drink from his red Solo cup of pre-mixed margarita. Surrounded by the failed drafts of his note on his desk, he wiped a tear from his drooping eye.

Recalling a coaching session from his animator--

&gt; //&#34;What the fuck are you doing, Paddy? Are you fucking crying?!&#34;//
&gt; 
&gt; //I-I&#39;m sorry, Mr. Singer... you&#39;re just shouting at me, and...//
&gt; 
&gt; //&#34;You don&#39;t fucking cry in the cartoon business!&#34;//
&gt; 
&gt; //...why not?//
&gt; 
&gt; //&#34;Because I have no idea how to draw a crying pelican!&#34;//

Paddy closed his eyes. He grabbed the duffel bag from under his broken bed frame. Two shotguns peeked out from the opened zipper. He sighed.

He wouldn&#39;t cry. He wouldn&#39;t bluff. He wouldn&#39;t ask how he was doing.

For the first time in his life, Paddy Theophrastus Pelican would make good on his threats.

-----

&#34;Is that like the castle you work at, Daddy?&#34; 

Lisle Naismith awoke from his nap on the couch as his 6-year-old daughter, Penny, pointed to the TV, The interior of a gigantic animated castle filled the screen.

&#34;Oh, did Mom put in Sleeping Beauty?&#34;

His daughter nodded.

&#34;Right. Well, our castle is at least three times that big. But usually it&#39;s so full of kid-eating trolls that you can&#39;t see the ceiling.&#34;

When your kid had an imagination, it was easier than usual to keep your job as a Foundation Site Director a secret.

Lisle&#39;s eyes closed again as Maleficent came into the hall to cast her famous spinning wheel curse. His tension faded away amidst the sounds of bickering fairies. Shocked soldiers. Evil magic. A cocking shotgun. A firing shotgun.

There were no shotguns in //Sleeping Beauty.// 

Lisle opened his eyes. As red splatters colored the walls of King Stefan&#39;s palace, horrified attendees of Aurora&#39;s christening ran for the doors.

&#34;What the devil is going on?&#34; said Maleficent, turning her attention away from the King and Queen who hadn&#39;t invited her. &#34;You can kill whomever you want //after// I&#39;m done here, you meddlesom--&#34;

In a flash of buckshot, Maleficent&#39;s jaw became a red cloud. From the left side of the screen, a black and white pelican, drawn with significantly less effort than the rest of the cast, let out a drunken laugh as he mowed down the cast.

//2835.// Lisle was on his feet in an instant.

As the pelican jammed the smoking barrel into the mouth of the young princess, he stared into Lisle&#39;s terrified eyes. //&#34;Naiiiiii-smiiiiith!!&#34;// he shrieked. //&#34;Reap what y--&#34;//

Lisle punched the eject button on the DVD player.

Penny stared at the TV with pursed lips. Not frightened, but she hadn&#39;t blinked once throughout the scene.

&#34;Sleeping Beauty&#39;s a really weird movie,&#34; she said.

&#34;I&#39;m sorry you saw that,&#34; said Lisle.

Penny shrugged. &#34;It&#39;s a lot better than [[[scp-993|that clown show]]].&#34;
