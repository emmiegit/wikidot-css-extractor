**Item #:** SCP-3371

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3371 is to be contained within a high-grade intangible humanoid containment chamber (minimal furnishing). Requests pertaining to the use of artistic implements are to be denied.

SCP-3371-1 through SCP-3371-7 are to be contained within a high-value object warehouse, and monitored via CCTV cameras. Following a Reanimation Event, relevant containers are to be examined for damages and repaired appropriately.

**Description:** SCP-3371 is an incorporeal entity bearing heavy resemblance to English contemporary artist Damien Hirst, barring two small, round scars located on its temples. SCP-3371 is entirely intangible, passing through solid surfaces with no evident resistance.

SCP-3371 was initially captured after reports centralized within the Tate Modern art gallery suggested the presence of a male figure &#39;passing through walls&#39;. MTF Mu-13 (&#34;Ghostbusters&#34;) was dispatched, and apprehended SCP-3371 as it observed a series of paintings.

Efforts to locate Hirst for interview have been unsuccessful.

SCP-3371-1 through SCP-3371-7 designate a series of periodically animate exhibitions and objects, all of which SCP-3371 claims to have created during its corporeal state.

&#39;Reanimation Events&#39; tend to occur with a frequency of one every twelve days, each event lasting for approximately four hours. The specific effects are unique to each object, but generally characterised by the movement of a previously deceased animal or inanimate object.

||~ SUBJECT ||~ DESCRIPTION||~ ANIMATE PROPERTIES ||
|| SCP-3371-1 || //The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living//, the carcass of a mature tiger shark within a glass vitrine. Preserved via formaldehyde solution. || The shark thrashes violently, often shattering or otherwise damaging the vitrine. In the event that SCP-3371-1 breaches its container, it will proceed to roll onto its back and cease the function of its vital organs. ||
|| SCP-3371-2 || //For The Love of God//, a diamond-encrusted human skull cast from platinum. || SCP-3371-2 will chatter rapidly, displaying an estimated bite force of 3,200 psi. No visible damages to teeth. ||
|| SCP-3371-3 || //The Dream//, the carcass of a foal. A prominent resin &#39;horn&#39; is located on the forehead in order to simulate the classic depiction of a &#39;unicorn&#39;. Preserved via formaldehyde solution. || SCP-3371-3 has been observed to violently buck its hind legs against its container in an attempt to break through. It has thus far been unsuccessful in doing so. ||
|| SCP-3371-4 || //The Golden Calf//, a white calf with gilded horns and hooves, topped with a decorative golden plate. Preserved via formaldehyde solution. || SCP-3371-4 will behave similarly to SCP-3371-3, kicking its container in an attempt to shatter the glass. SCP-3371-4 has been successful on two separate occasions, both of which it spent slowly circling SCP-3371-3&#39;s container. ||
|| SCP-3371-5 || //For Heaven&#39;s Sake//, a platinum casting of an infant&#39;s skull, studded with both pink and white diamonds. || SCP-3371-5 will &#39;cry&#39;, resulting in a long, piercing noise emanating from the skull, followed by small teardrop-shaped diamonds forming around the sockets. No relevance to SCP-3371-2, barring superficial similarities. ||
|| SCP-3371-6 || //A Thousand Years//, an exhibition consisting of a decomposing cow&#39;s head, several //Musca domestica//[[footnote]]Common housefly.[[/footnote]] larvae, and an electric insect killer. A pool of dried blood is present around the head.|| The head will lift and hover, as if connected to a living cow, and &#39;graze&#39; on a non-existent pasture for approximately five minutes. It will then remain at a standstill for the remaining period of time, accompanied by a distinct &#39;squelching&#39; sound. ||
|| SCP-3371-7 || //Mickey//, a gloss painting, consisting of twelve coloured dots, intending to form the figure of popular cartoon character &#39;Mickey Mouse&#39;.  || SCP-3371-7 will disassemble, gradually protruding from the canvas and spiraling randomly in several directions. Upon reaching a length of two meters, the &#39;tubes&#39; will become hollow and deposit an average of £480 in coins and rolled-up bank notes. ||

[[collapsible show=&#34;► Open VIDEO LOG / Interview 3371-A &#34; hide=&#34;▼ Close VIDEO LOG / Interview 3371-A&#34;]]
**Interviewed:** SCP-3371
**Interviewer:** Dr. Ayoade
**Foreword:** SCP-3371 had thus far spent its containment pacing the far wall, humming various unidentified songs, and attempting to scratch into its wooden flooring.

&gt; **[BEGIN LOG]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ayoade:** Good afternoon. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3371:** (//Bitterly//) Is it? I couldn&#39;t tell, what with the lack of any natural light. I&#39;m going to look awfully pale by the time I get out.
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr. Ayoade pauses to take notes. SCP-3371 cranes its neck, attempting to read what he has written down.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ayoade:** We&#39;ll see if we can do anything about that.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3371:** Hey, while you&#39;re at it- could I have a sketchbook and some pencils? Hell, a biro would be alright, actually. Just something to ease the boredom.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ayoade:** My superiors have expressed concern over further creations gaining anomalous properties- so for now, I&#39;m afraid the answer is no.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-3371 grumbles discontentedly.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ayoade:** May I ask a few questions? Nothing particularly personal, just regarding your current state.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3371:** Blimey, if you must. I thought this was a prison.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ayoade:** Understandably. To begin, what led you to the Tate Modern art gallery? What were your intentions?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3371:** If you&#39;re asking me about any big ulterior motives, you&#39;re out of luck. It just brought back some memories. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ayoade:** Go on.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-3371 pauses, grinding its teeth as it thinks.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3371:** //For The Love of God//- from what I&#39;ve been told, you&#39;re familiar with it- was put on display there way back in twenty-twelve. There&#39;s other places, of course, but it just stuck out to me as somewhere I needed to go.  (//A pause.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ayoade:** SCP-3371-2? What about that piece in particular did you find so attractive?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3371:** It&#39;s about art, and it&#39;s about money, you know? &#39;Greed will be the death of us&#39;. That&#39;s something I&#39;ve wanted to chase all my life, and that&#39;s the closest I&#39;ve ever gotten. Well, until now, that is.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-3371 folds its arms, smiling toward Dr. Ayoade.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ayoade:** I&#39;m sorry- what do you mean by that?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3371:** You know, it&#39;s- what&#39;s the ultimate connection between art and money? Gogh never got his slice of the pie, Kafka kicked the fucking bucket before he was a household name. It sickens me, but it fascinates me. Because you know what death does better than anything else? It makes people listen. It loosens up their wallets. I wanted that. I wanted to make people feel that. So I just sort of-
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-3371 raises two fingers to its left temple, creating a mock &#39;gunshot&#39; sound with its mouth.//
&gt; 
&gt; - kch kch, boom. Popped my clogs. It&#39;s perfect. It&#39;s- it&#39;s the crux of everything I want to represent. It&#39;s my &#39;magnum opus&#39;.
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr. Ayoade stares silently for a few seconds. A long sigh can be heard before he speaks again.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Ayoade:** I think we&#39;ll stop there. Any special requests before we finish up?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3371:** Get my skeleton up on display somewhere. Gilded.
