We gotta keep our own, don&#39;t we? 

That&#39;s what my dear Momma always said. If ya got something earned, or somethin&#39; that&#39;s yours, keep it safe. Don&#39;t let any o&#39; them outside peepers come creepin&#39; in, tryin&#39; to make off with somethin&#39; of yours. She wanted to keep away from them folks, to live with what we already got.

I kept care of Momma and Sue Ann fer all my life. Side by side, we lived&#39;n peace, and sometimes comfort, if we was lucky. We each had our protection, an&#39; used it well. But, sometimes it wadn&#39;t enough. Momma passed back in &#39;48, bless her heart. Big storm knocked her right over, an&#39; she never got up. Sue Ann got to be with Momma some years after, with a rusted heart.

But y&#39;can&#39;t let yerself fall apart when some&#39;n your own ain&#39;t around anyplace. I kept up, remembrin&#39; them and keepin&#39; to my own, like Momma woulda wanted me to. Keepin&#39; it safe. The protector don&#39;t quite look like what he used to be, but that don&#39;t change a thing, now does it? Still keeps to me, like I do t&#39;him. Y&#39;all should&#39;ve kept to yerselves, &#39;stead of headin&#39; here.

You folks never learn. Comin&#39; onto someone else&#39;s land ain&#39;t respectful, and then up and lyin&#39; about it don&#39;t help. I chased yer buddies away, maybe they&#39;ll think twice about coming back. Anythin&#39;s possible. Lookit em&#39; run. They go quick when they scared, don&#39;t they? 

Now, uh, fer you. See, my protector&#39;s been gettin&#39; on in his years, and he don&#39;t have the spring to his step what like he used to. Tellin&#39; me he&#39;s tired, and wants rest. The man deserves to rest more&#39;n anyone. But, I still need a protector. 

You like beans? Aww, well you&#39;ll learn&#39;t love &#39;em, soon.
