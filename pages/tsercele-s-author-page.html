Howdy! I&#39;m **Sarah Szell**, also known as **Tsercele** (she/her), a transgender author with a keen interest in sci-fi, cosmic horror and cultural esoterica. I read the SCP Wiki intermittently for many years, but once I discovered Gamers Against Weed, I knew I wanted to contribute.

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-4581: Anti-Racist Audiocassette&#34; hide=&#34;TRACK 6 FOREVER&#34;]]
* My first mainlist SCP! Way more successful than I could reasonably have hoped.
* Primarily inspired by a Canadian propagandist getting copywrecked in public, circa April 2019.
* &#34;Foundation webcrawler I/O-GASNIER&#34; is named after the director of //[*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reefer_Madness Reefer Madness]//.
* The &#34;MxMasters&#34; alias was inspired by one of [https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/722962790470803456 @mcclure111&#39;s jokes on Twitter].
* Since this was my first article, I didn&#39;t want to step on any toes by claiming that Wren was super close with established members of GAW. That&#39;s where the &#34;terrestrial years&#34; joke came from -- to demonstrate that steakshift genuinely doesn&#39;t know that bones is an alien satellite.
* During the interrogation scene, Wren&#39;s &#34;Handycam&#34; trick is activated with a short phrase and a distinctive whistle. There are a couple other triggers, all of which are nerdy and uncomfortable.

[[collapsible show=&#34;&#34;Smile! You Are Being Watched!&#34;&#34; hide=&#34;&#34;Everything old is new again.&#34;&#34;]]
* In the course of writing SCP-4581, I got a pretty solid grasp on where Wren was coming from as a character, and built in some plot hooks for future expansion. When the article took off, I was eager to elaborate!
* I&#39;m hoping to expand on the &#34;ReTerminal&#34; Way network and the &#34;Restricted Shelf&#34; in future Tales.
* Wren tries to signal Jude by quoting //&#34;Three Days of the Condor&#34;// (1975), which is about a think-tank bookworm forced to put his research into practice. This appeals to Masterson, who fancies themselves an autodidact.
* I wasn&#39;t sure how comfortable Jude would be during Wren&#39;s meltdown, so I mostly had him respond with silence and platitudes. Rereading it now, I don&#39;t think Wren knows Jude is trans at this point!

[[collapsible show=&#34;Start the Music&#34; hide=&#34;&#34;&#39;NEMO&#39; is asked (i.e., told) to join the team.&#34;&#34;]]
* This story was written as the youngest employee of an intensely bureaucratic organization with distinct cultural divides. Sometimes, you&#39;re assigned extra responsibilities because of your age bracket, and there really isn&#39;t a way to say &#34;no&#34;.
* //&#34;Don&#39;t Look Any Further&#34;// appears in a (much-reviled) episode of //&#34;The X-Files&#34;//. Penelope watched it back in the day, which is why the song seems familiar.
* I like the idea of GAW being politically radioactive at Foundation offices. Nobody wants anything to do with those clowns!
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-4784: Nature Abhors a Vacuum Tube&#34; hide=&#34;&#34;wtf is Tilford&#39;s folly?&#34;&#34;]]
* Distantly descended from a high school art project, where I wheeled a TV out into a tree-lined pathway. Can&#39;t find the photo anymore, but I still like the mental image.
* Reading about Jude&#39;s escape from AWCY got me thinking about how different Critics might run their operations, and how those cells might interact. I figured that they would be competitive, with low-level anartists vying for attention and Critics working their own agendas. In short: a pressure cooker waiting to blow.
* By the same token, I wondered how other ex-members of AWCY might be haunted by past misdeeds. In that way, SCP-4784 is kinda like Wren&#39;s version of Jude&#39;s SCP-3420, &#34;Too Many Ghosts&#34;.
* Jude was not involved with the Deer College anart scene, but the idea that &#34;The Roller&#34; heard about it through the grapevine has haunted Wren for years.
* I take a lot of inspiration from historical anecdotes, because history is wild as hell sometimes. &#34;Luring an immigrant into the woods with the promise of a farmstead&#34; was apparently a real threat back in the day.
* I hesitated to tag 4784 as a pattern screamer, since the logic of it is so obtuse. Still: the inspiration is there! Arbitrary number sequences, fractals... and an eye that never closes. A lens that&#39;s always watching the outside world. A pinhole, if you will.

[[collapsible show=&#34;The Not-Too-Distant Future&#34; hide=&#34;&#34;Whoever and wherever we are, we are not alone.&#34;&#34;]]
* In hindsight, going &#34;fuck it, let&#39;s tell this story backwards!&#34; may have been overambitious. Chalk it up to &#34;nothing ventured, nothing gained&#34;.
* The idea of leading with Felix Kipp&#39;s death and exploring his legacy after the fact was inspired in part by //One Piece//. 
* The interstitial segments represent the pattern screamer deducing its own existence. It starts with a wall; then there&#39;s a hole; then it figures out the existence of zero, and things start snowballing. Soon, it&#39;s piecing together the idea of &#34;dead&#34; and &#34;alive&#34;. Then it starts remembering things, assembling itself from junk data, and oh boy, it is pissed!
* Anna&#39;s use of &#34;I/we&#34; and &#34;me/us&#34; has led people to speculate that Wren is a multiple system. That wasn&#39;t my intention -- it&#39;s more that they&#39;re displaced from their sense of self -- but at the same time, I think that&#39;s a very valid interpretation.
* Penelope is motivated by two completely contradictory things: professional obligation and personal trauma. She&#39;s supposed to be on top of her game in every possible capacity, but she&#39;s also terrified of her own lapses in judgment. What if she fails to act and someone gets hurt? It&#39;s not an unreasonable fear, but it&#39;s also not completely rational.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Salt and Pepper (Extra Salty)&#34; hide=&#34;&#34;&#39;Genre-savvy&#39; implies that life has a genre.&#34;&#34;]]
* Meeting up in a public space is a pretty standard thing in espionage fiction -- so of course, there had to be a twist. Given the overall tone of GAW, shielding a diner conversation within a comedy routine came to mind immediately.
* At the beginning of their conversation, Wren doesn&#39;t actually know that Penelope resents her nickname, because they only activated their Handycam trick //after// she introduced herself. From her perspective, Wren remembers the whole interrogation, and now they&#39;re gloating! Of course she socks them one.
* The &#34;red light, green light&#34; coghaz is triggered by hex codes. Challenge code &#34;a3a11f&#34; is yellow. 
* As soon as I typed out, &#34;I would literally never fuck you&#34;, I realized that Penelope was an asexual lesbian. That&#39;s just how the process works sometimes.
* The debate over the relative safety of SCP-4581 is a follow-up to some of the feedback I received in the comment thread. I like writing arguments where both characters are technically right.
* Wren doesn&#39;t like to think of themselves as a reality bender, because in this universe, reality benders frequently get shot in the face without warning. In their mind, that is a &#34;genre convention&#34; to be avoided at all costs.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Alto Clef Jr.: Day of the Doorcrasher&#34; hide=&#34;&#34;Engorge your membranes on this atrocity, broheim.&#34;&#34;]]
* I read through the [[[goc-act-hub|GOC ACT]]] for the first time because of Underread &amp; Underrated, and finished it in one sitting. A matchup with Murderer™ seemed like a perfect fit.
* In GOC parlance, &#34;Velveteen-Typhon&#34; refers to an &#34;animate object, kinetic threat&#34;; &#34;6684&#34; is just [[[SCP-4866]]], backwards.
* When the narration says &#34;some of their programming is predictable&#34;, I was referring to Murderer™ grabbing stuff out of the air, like Mark&#39;s cell phone and Buck&#39;s grenade.
* I want to write more Buckchamp someday. What a silly (scary) goose.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Somewhere Empty&#34; hide=&#34;&#34;You weaponized a human soul.&#34;&#34;]]
* BananaRepublic&#39;s rewrite of SCP-285 (Mr. Hax) explored how GAW&#39;s projects can be subverted by people they (wrongly) considered friends. Since the specifics were left ambiguous, I found myself wondering how GAW might have &#34;dealt with&#34; Ken and Jordan... and then I remembered an offhand reference to &#34;Hand assassins&#34; in Phantom Blunt. Bingo!
* Based on his dialogue, Ken seemed like an odd fit for GAW. How did he get into the group in the first place? Simple: Wren invited him. Obviously, that was a bad decision.
* Banjo, Skye and Clark are broad parodies of Piccolo, Krillin/18, and Goku. (I was tempted to make his name &#34;Gary&#34;, but my friends agreed that &#34;Clark&#34; was funnier.) In this scenario, Kenneth and Masterson represent the spectators who are always off to one side, commentating on the fights.
* I always figured that Wren&#39;s higher-level abilities would make them nauseous. The fact that Jordan had a similar weakness was a happy coincidence.
* Not every anomalous individual can bust out offensive magic anytime they want. Ken needs tools (like Hax) to deploy cognitohazards, and Masterson&#39;s tricks are all tied to physical or conceptual control systems. Unfortunately for Kenneth, I established that Wren carries a folding knife in &#34;The Not-Too-Distant Future&#34;, and their commitment to pacifism is... conditional. 
* Masterson isn&#39;t too comfortable with the &#34;Misters Against Weed&#34; project. Something about rehousing dead souls hits a little close to home.

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-6476: Let A Die Be Cast!&#34; hide=&#34;&#34;rawr!! XD&#34;&#34;]]
* Sometimes an anomaly is just a lil --guy-- inconvenience.
* I did Penelope Gore (whistl_stahp) a disservice by starting at the arbitary &#34;end&#34; of the story in Hornor&#39;s Crossing. The next few MxTape pieces are deliberate attempts to remedy that, and explore what she&#39;s like on the job.
* I have plans to flesh out all the supporting characters mentioned in this chat. Here&#39;s a few tidbits.
 * Doreen Gray (alwaysbpositive) was always key to this story. The idea of a teen vampire has always seemed sad to me, but someone getting turned around 2005 makes it comical, and grounding her (admittedly extreme) reactions to stress in the language of social justice makes it more relatable. Doreen is out of step with the group, but shares that state of perpetual adolescence common among GAW members. Oh, and her PoI number is &#34;1337&#34; backwards. It was a different time.
 * meatgerm / PoI-6660 might be demonspawn, or perhaps a half-baked Antichrist. Plays a mean fiddle, though.
 * Tanya Miller (twilight_tone) is an indie anartist and Dreamer. Her attitude towards role-playing games (&#34;keep the story moving&#34;) is very much inspired by one of my dearest friends!
 * Louis (WHEREISMYHOG) is so named because he stole an 1100-lb blue ribbon boar using magic. I don&#39;t know whether he brought it back. Hope so.
 * Based on their class skills and motivations, Penelope (whistl_stahp) obviously had to play a Cleric. It just made sense. At the same time, &#34;whistl&#34; can&#39;t come across as overly zealous or invasive, lest she raise the group&#39;s suspicions. Instead, she tries to be moderate. Hence her role as a mediator. 
* CLOWNFISH is set up as a two-tier, double-blind operation. Each local working group has its own approach to the mission, but they all share the same security protocols, which dictate total compartmentalization. CLOWNFISH assets at Site-76 can see each other&#39;s chosen handles, so they can pretend to be friends online, but every effort is made to keep handles divorced from code names. Peers in a CLOWNFISH working group can probably infer each other&#39;s codenames from the Level 3 documentation, but operatives working from other sites are kept in the dark.
 * Incidentally, Penelope&#39;s PoI number has 13 in the middle, and the digits add up to 13. That&#39;s because she is very, very unlucky. There&#39;s also a 17 and a 23 in there, but don&#39;t worry about that, it&#39;s meaningless.

[[collapsible show=&#34;NTE-2858-Cyan-Blaecca -- &#34;Village Jeweler&#34;&#34; hide=&#34;&#34;HOOPS.&#34;&#34;]]
* When I started writing for the SCP Wiki in 2019, there wasn&#39;t very much in the way of Canadian content. No Nexus communities, no major Ways -- basically nothing for my characters to bounce off of. Then I read ch00bakka&#39;s &#34;Australian Rules Drag Racing&#34;, in which 8837 London was first mentioned! I recently reached out to the Third Law Discord, and the rest is (fake) history.
* No hidden 23s in this one! Instead, there are a few veiled allusions to socialist history, and a bunch of plot hooks I&#39;m planning to expand on.
