Hey everyone, I&#39;m Wydness. You may know me as that creepy 049 fangirl who writes weird stories, but that&#39;s not what this is for. I&#39;ve finally decided to make an art page after... what, a year? I&#39;ll be slowly updating this over time. Regrettably I don&#39;t draw as much as I used to, but whenever I make something that I feel is worthy, you&#39;ll see it here immediately. I don&#39;t take requests as they cause me a lot of stress, but if you want me to draw something for your SCP/tale/etc., leave me a message and I&#39;d be happy to discuss it.

**Traditional Artwork:**

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-049-J&#34; hide=&#34;poke poke poke&#34;]]
[[image https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/505866956088410127/522624349170040833/049-J.png width=&#34;300px&#34;]]
-
I quickly sketched this the day after the sequel to BS&amp;F came out since 049-J was on everyone&#39;s mind. I always imagined him as looking more fabric than something biological.

-
I made this back for the 10th Anniversary contest in August of 2017. It was my attempt to depict some of the the various creatures that emerged from the red pool. I don&#39;t think it was ever accepted... I couldn&#39;t tell you why. I made this during a phase in which I liked to make massive colored pencil illustrations; some of the techniques are very outdated but people have told me they still like it.

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-2521 World Concept&#34; hide=&#34;///////&#34;]]

-
I made this for a project that never went far. It was a background image of the place that SCP-2521 takes things looks like.

**Digital Artwork:**

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-049 (Experimental)&#34; hide=&#34;I love you Jade&#34;]]
[[image https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/505866956088410127/521870963185549312/049_sketch.png width=&#34;400px&#34;]]
-
I made this based off a little sketch that [[*user Gabriel Jade]] made of 049 on his phone. (I kept begging him). It was pretty abstract so I did my best to interpret it.

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-049&#34; hide=&#34;I love him&#34;]]
[[image https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/505866956088410127/521870988678397952/049_Final.png width=&#34;400px&#34;]]
-
This is my drawing of 049 for that coloring book I won&#39;t shut up about. It&#39;s honestly a bit edgier than I normally draw him but I figured it&#39;s what people would like. I&#39;m getting closer to figuring out how I want him to look... closer...

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-527&#34; hide=&#34;Glub glub&#34;]]
[[image https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/505866956088410127/521871005090578433/527_Final.png width=&#34;400px&#34;]]
-
Another drawing for the coloring book, this one of SCP-527. I&#39;m actually really proud of this. It&#39;s probably my first time drawing someone in a suit halfway decently, and the composition turned out really nicely in my opinion.

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-2006&#34; hide=&#34;I love 2006 bless you weizhong&#34;]]
[[image https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/505866956088410127/521871030583689226/2006_Final.png width=&#34;400px&#34;]]
-
One final drawing for the coloring book unless I decide to post any more here. This is... probably the drawing I&#39;ve been happiest with in a long time. It was a lot of fun trying to make terrible B-movie monster designs while putting some personality into the drawing.

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-4910&#34; hide=&#34;Teeth&#34;]]

-
Yeah of course 2006 wasn&#39;t going to be my last upload. Have a tooth monster.

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-682 Body Pillow (NSFW-ish)&#34; hide=&#34;fuck&#34;]]

-
You probably thought this was a joke, didn&#39;t you? Or maybe, at least, you hoped it was. But no, here it is in all its redacted glory. I made this upon [[*user Andre Bechert]]&#39;s request. (Also, if you want the uncensored version of this, you can absolutely hit me up on Discord.)

[[collapsible show=&#34;Dr. Cimmerian x SCP-2913 (NSFW-ish)&#34; hide=&#34;THIS IS SO WEIRD&#34;]]

This is so weird wtf was I thinking

**Physical Media:**

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-999 Phone Cases&#34; hide=&#34;:3&#34;]]

-
I made these as an experiment with decoden. Apparently they make people really hungry.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Wondertainment Ribbon&#34; hide=&#34;Bless this GOI&#34;]]
[[image https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/507340945814061056/523979297145225216/image0.jpg width=&#34;400px&#34;]]
-
This was made entirely by hand, no machines involved. I&#39;m hoping to cosplay as Dr. Wondertainment one day.

**Things I made for other people:**

[[collapsible show=&#34;Cack Hard Movie Poster&#34; hide=&#34;I don&#39;t have Photoshop&#34;]]
[[image https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/505866956088410127/521871191250698240/cack_hard_poster.png width=&#34;400px&#34;]]
-
This is another thing I made for [[*user Gabriel Jade]]. He wanted a movie poster of the [[[cack-hard|first tale in the &#34;Cack Hard&#34; series.]]] The picture of the crumbling building in the background is my own, and all other images used in the edit are CC-compliant.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Corneliu&#34; hide=&#34;Sarkic turkey meat rain&#34;]]
[[image https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/505866956088410127/527902061178650624/Corneliu.png width=&#34;400px&#34;]]
-
Ok, so this was actually a brick I painted for my first SCP, [[[scp-3581|3581]]] but I felt it would be more appropriate here (and I&#39;m going to make a proper portrait of Corneliu eventually). Did my best to make this look like an old painting with fading colors.
