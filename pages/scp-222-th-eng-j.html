&gt; **Dr. Alpha :** Hello
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-222-TH-J :** Hello, Doc. Why today’s very hot? Do something!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alpha :** A cat, who sent you here?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-222-TH-J :** I’m not a cat. Call me properly, a stupid human!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alpha :** Who’s your owner…? //(Dr. Alpha starts to make an angry voice.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-222-TH-J :** I&#39;d tell you if I knew. //(SCP-222-TH-J uses a smile emoticon in the chat box.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alpha :** Do you know this place is?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-222-TH-J :** I guess that it&#39;s a place where the human like you live together [REDACTED] for breeding [REDACTED].
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-222-TH-J :** Hey, Doc! Do you have any catnip?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alpha :** Huh!? What’s the catnip?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-222-TH-J :** Huuuh! What the bloody did you say!? How the bloody you graduated as a Doctoral Degree!? You don’t even know the catnip! //(Then SCP-222-TH-J types the texts in the chat box rapidly.)// Wanker! Which school had ever taught you!? How the bloody they allowed you to be graduated!? You don’t even know the catnip! Such a wasted! Your friends may laugh at you for having a stupid friend! You don’t have any pets at home, do you!? Or do you live alone without any friends!? Airy-fairy! I’ll teach you what’s the catnip! Such a rubbish! [REDACTED].
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-222-TH-J berates Dr. Alpha for 3 minutes then stops.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-222-TH-J :** A stupid Doc, have you already known the catnip? You know, the catnip helps me to feel relax.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alpha :** Er, what’s your ability?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-222-TH-J :** I want the catnip, bring it to me now!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alpha :** After we finish for this topic. In a nutshell, what’s your ability?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-222-TH-J :** You know! the security system here is very weak!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alpha :** What do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; //(SCP-222-TH-J presses something on the keyboard. After that, there is the blackout for the whole Site. The secondary electricity system runs instead of the primary one. The alarm sound alerts.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alpha :** What the bloody are you doing!?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-222-TH-J :** I just hacked a small system. An easy task…
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alpha :** Ok, enough for now, a stupid cat!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-222-TH-J :**  take note that █████ will rule this world! Oh...this system here is quite complicated. 
&gt; //(types something on the laptop with licking its mouth)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alpha :** I said it’s enough!!! //(smashes on the table very loud.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-222-TH-J :** You don’t have any bloody rights to order me! Wanker!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alpha :** Enough! Otherwise, I&#39;ll…
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-222-TH-J :** What will you do!? You don’t have any bloody rights to hurt me! Otherwise, you&#39;ll be transferred!
&gt; 
&gt; //(Dr. Alpha stands and goes out from the room. He comes back later with a water sprayer. Then, he directly reaches and sprays at SCP-222-TH-J until SCP-222-TH-J jumps out from there, runs away from Dr. Alpha with a loud hissing.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Alpha :** This is just a warning, a bloody cat! Next time will be a water bowl.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Then SCP-222-TH-J is held by Dr. Xu for taking it away from the laptop, and is taken back to its chamber with 3 bottles of catnip.)//
