**Item #:** SCP-6229

**Object Class:** --Keter-- Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6229 is to be kept in a standard anomalous humanoid containment unit. Every month, SCP-6229 is to have a recorded therapy session by --Dr. Elijah Whitaker-- Angela Richards for a period of --one hour-- --three hours-- at minimum three hours, up to a maximum of forty-eight hours. 

A camera is to be continuously active in the containment cell and monitored for any unauthorized departures. --Six Scranton Reality Anchors are to be embedded into the walls, ceiling, and floor of the cell and activated in the event a demanifestation incident were to occur.--

Researcher Evelyn Agapov is to be monitored by three Foundation agents. Should SCP-6229 attempt to breach containment, Researcher Evelyn Agapov is to be detained for a period of thirty minutes and, should SCP-6229 not return to containment, terminated.

**Description:** SCP-6229 is a sapient full-body ████████-alloy mechanical suit with anti-humetic properties. It is equipped with a camera and voice synthesizer, the former being a detachable component connected to the chestplate while the latter appears to be directly connected with the neck. SCP-6229 is powered by a luminescent device built into the chestplate. The mechanisms are currently under investigation.

SCP-6229 displays an external hume level of 99.9, theoretically rendering it immune to reality-based alterations. Its internal constitution repels reality at a constant rate, giving it the passive capability to ignore external anomalous behaviors and triggers. Cross-testing revealed that SCP objects that were able to directly influence or impact non-anomalous researchers had no effect on SCP-6229. [[footnote]] Full list available upon request from Angela Richards. [[/footnote]]

Physically, SCP-6229 shows a high tolerance against damage, capable of withstanding temperatures up to 5000°C and impact forces from bullets smaller than .50 caliber. SCP-6229 is capable of becoming incorporeal, allowing it to phase through physical objects at will.

SCP-6229 claims to be Bennet Zhu Hao, a former employee of Prometheus Labs. Save for the files gathered from Prometheus Labs seizures, no records indicate that any such individual has ever existed.

**Addendum:**

Files regarding SCP-6229 were seized by Foundation Agents from Prometheus Labs on August 28, 2003 following containment of SCP-6229. Those too damaged to read were sent to the Restoration Department.

Given the volume of files, they have been ordered chronologically.

//Transcript of an audio recording regarding SCP-6229&#39;s recruitment by Prometheus Labs.//
//Date: 8/18/1995//

Individuals: Agent Francis Morrison, Junior Researcher Bennet Zhu Hao
------
**Morrison:** So, Mr. Hao, you&#39;re currently working under Dr. Goldstein, correct?

**SCP-6229:** That&#39;s right. I&#39;ve been his assistant for four years now.

**Morrison:** And during this time, your particular condition was discovered and subsequently cured by Prometheus Labs, correct?

**SCP-6229:** I wouldn&#39;t say &#39;cured&#39;. More so-

**Morrison:** Mr. Hao, are you currently able to experience a quality of life that you would not be able to without the assistance and care of Prometheus Labs?

**SCP-6229:** In the strictest sense, yes. But I&#39;d hardl-

**Morrison:** Are you aware that Prometheus Labs invested no less than eight hundred //million// dollars into your cure?

**SCP-6229:** No, I wasn&#39;t.

**Morrison:** Did you know that at your current salary, it&#39;d take you over fifteen //thousand// years to pay off this debt?

**SCP-6229:** Are you putting the entire cost of resea-

**Morrison:** Mr. Hao, please. Prometheus Labs has put a lot, and I mean //a lot//, of money and time into you. Are you trying to say that you&#39;re not going to pay this off?

**SCP-6229:** I- I&#39;m not going to pay off the entire cost of researching this thing. And didn&#39;t Prometheus develop some kind of reality stabilizer based off that research anyhow?

**Morrison:** Yes, and that&#39;s exactly why we&#39;re giving you an opportunity.

**SCP-6229:** ...what?

**Morrison:** Prometheus Labs is giving you a chance to pay off this debt at a relatively low cost to you. I can&#39;t exactly tell you the details before you accept, but just between you and me, if you accept, Prometheus will waive the entire cost of your treatment... and your father&#39;s.

**SCP-6229:** I&#39;m supposed to agree to something without even knowing what it is? Really?

**Morrison:** Well... it&#39;s not like you really have a choice here, do you?

//Video begins, taken by camera mounted to SCP-6229, who stands in front of a standard suburban American home. Time is 2:33 AM local time.//

**Williams:** So all we do is go in and nick the candle? That it?

**Fischer:** It&#39;s an anomalous object. It&#39;s not going to be that simple.

**Williams:** Yeah yeah, I read the thing too. Candle that makes you forget shit or whatever... they sure it ain&#39;t acid? I tripped hard after that. Nearly forgot my own name. Definitely forgot my pants, though-

**SCP-6229:** Cut the chatting and focus. I&#39;m picking up about three lifeforms inside, presumed to be father Charles Morris, mother Linda Morris, and child Craig Morris. Anomalous object has an effective range of three meters-

//A man walks in front of SCP-6229, identified as Jack Williams, puts a hand on SCP-6229&#39;s shoulder and speaks.//

**Williams:** Look, robo, I know you&#39;re &#39;team lead&#39; or whatever, but this ain&#39;t a military operation, a&#39;right? Let&#39;s just go in, grab the candle, and get out. It&#39;s as easy as that. If the reggies wake up, I&#39;ll put &#39;em back to sleep, &#39;kay?

//SCP-6229 shoves Williams&#39; arm away.//

**SCP-6229:** You do understand that I don&#39;t need either of you two for this operation, right? If either of you fucks this up, I will not hesitate to leave you behind, do the two of you understand?

**Fischer:** Understood.

**SCP-6229:** Fischer, set up the charges around the perimeter. I&#39;m going in. Williams, with me. And don&#39;t fuck it up.

//The camera moves towards the front door. SCP-6229 opens the door and steps into the house. A short staircase to the left leads upstairs. SCP-6229 signals Williams to search the upper floor.//

**Williams:** Really? Hand signals too? Why not start tapping that shit out in Morse code?

//Williams proceeds upstairs. SCP-6229 wanders the ground floor.//

//SCP-6229 enters the kitchen. A tall candle sits in the middle of a short wooden table, smoke trailing from its wick.//

**SCP-6229:** Williams, I have located the target. Come down ASAP.

//A loud crack is heard above SCP-6229 and Williams falls through the ceiling atop a large quadrupedal creature. He wipes his forehead and looks at SCP-6229.//

**Williams:** You rang?

**SCP-6229:** Are you seriousl- ...is that Mr. Morris?

//Williams nudges the unmoving creature below him with his foot.//

**Williams:** //Was//, yeah. Turns out he weren&#39;t too interested in stayin&#39; human. //He gestures at the candle.// This what we lookin&#39; for?

**SCP-6229:** What happened to the wife and child? If I have to deal-

**Williams:** Still sleepin&#39;, so get off my case, yeah? Put a little something in their rooms to keep &#39;em nice and quiet. So let&#39;s just grab and go &#39;fore they go the way their pa did.

**SCP-6229:** This is going on the report.

//SCP-6229 grabs the candle and the two leave the house. Fischer stands outside, a remote in his hand.//

**SCP-6229:** Fischer, are the charges ready?

**Fischer:** Ready to go whenever you say. 

**SCP-6229:** Start them. I&#39;m done here.

//Fischer presses a button. A brief hum can be heard before a bright flash envelops the house briefly.//

Foundation records indicate the devices used were prototype displacement charges designed to extract living organisms into a pocket universe before being expelled after 30 minutes. Their usage dwindled in 1999 after it was discovered their settings could not be configured as advertised. Devices were instead locked to physically and temporally displace all living organisms to Sumbawa, Indonesia of 1815.[[footnote]] Noteworthy for being the location of the eruption of Mount Tanbora.

//SCP-6229 sits facing Williams in a military cargo plane as the latter drinks from a canteen. Fischer sits besides Williams, carving a small wooden block.//

**Williams:** You got it up and running, chief? Make sure you get my good side for Prattles, ay?

**Fischer:** Don&#39;t think he can do that, Jack. That&#39;d require you //having// a good side.

**Williams:** Har har, think you&#39;re so funny, don&#39;t you?

//Williams throws his canteen at Fischer. The metal bottle misses and clangs off the floor. SCP-6229 laughs quietly.//

**Williams:** Oh, so you&#39;re joinin&#39; too, now? I see. Fuckin&#39; Americans, I&#39;m goin&#39; back to sleep.

//SCP-6229 coughs and looks away. Fischer smiles and continues carving.//

**Pilot:** We&#39;re about 10 minutes from destination. Get ready to drop.

**Williams:** You&#39;re jokin&#39;, right? And just as I was &#39;bout to get some sleep.

//SCP-6229 stands up and walks to the back of the plane.//

**SCP-6229:** I&#39;ll be leaving first. I&#39;ll see you both on the ground if I haven&#39;t finished already.

Your particular condition is the reason he&#39;s in the state he&#39;s in. Your presence there alone would only serve to worsen his chances of recovery. We&#39;re already sending you updates on him so what I fail to understand is why you need to know where he&#39;s being treated. I understand that you&#39;re family. I have a family of my own too. So I can guarantee that there&#39;s no way you&#39;ll be able to keep yourself away if he gets worse. I&#39;m sorry, Mr. Hao, but this is for the best. Both for you and him.

//Williams sits across from SCP-6229 and besides Fischer. They appear to be in the bay of a cargo plane. Williams takes a sip out of his canteen.//

**Williams:** So, you gonna introduce us or we just s&#39;posed to guess your new girlfriend&#39;s name?

**SCP-6229:** I was just getting the camera on again. It disconnected when I got on the plane.

**Fischer:** Doesn&#39;t it do that every time you phase out? Why don&#39;t you get Dr. Goldstein to fix it?

**Williams:** Oi, don&#39;t change the subject, Mark. Who&#39;s the chick, chief?

**SCP-6229:** Hold on... (//The camera turns to face a blonde woman in standard combat gear beside SCP-6229//) This is Felicia Ahlin, she&#39;ll be part of the team from now on and no, Jack, she&#39;s married.

**Ahlin:** Pleasure to meet you both officially. 

**Williams:** Right. Yeah so, why is she here? Also, that camera comes off? Since fuckin&#39; when?

**SCP-6229:** We&#39;ve been in need of someone like Felicia for awhile now, and yes the camera is detachable and it&#39;s been detachable since the beginning. Do you recall that mission when we had to get that golden statue from France?

**Williams:** That the one I got drunk at?

**Fischer:** Is there a mission you don&#39;t get drunk at?

**Williams:** Shut it. That&#39;s the one at the Louvre, yeah? With the prissy man-boy we couldn&#39;t understand?

**SCP-6229:** Not my choice of words, but yes. Pratsky doesn&#39;t want another of those to happen. Felicia is a polyglot.

**Ahlin:** I am fluent in 16 modern languages, 5 dead languages, 7 occult languages, and I was a part of Prometheus&#39; special division in Sweden. Is that enough for you, Mr. Williams?

**Williams:** Oh so you&#39;re like, what, some kinda secretary or something? The hell you doing in the field with us?

//Ahlin appears visibly annoyed.//

**Ahlin:** I&#39;m sorry, are you- aren&#39;t you the failed magician that Prometheus picked off the streets not even two years ago? I&#39;d say I&#39;m far more qualified to be here than you are.

**Williams:** Oi, don&#39;t go picking fights you can&#39;t win, //ma&#39;am//. I was //failed// cuz it ain&#39;t like killing an audience is like to get you repeat viewers.

**Ahlin:** Something I hear you have firsthand experience with.

**Williams:** You fucking cu-

//Williams stands up while pulling out a standard playing card. Ahlin pulls out a handgun and aims it at Williams.//

**Fischer:** Cut it out, you two. Chief&#39;s already said that Miss Felicia is joining us, Jack. And if you wanna complain, don&#39;t. This is a team and a team has to work together. Miss Felicia, I understand that Jack has a grating personality at best, but it&#39;d be in all of our interests if you refrained from bringing up any of our pasts, alright?

**Ahlin:** Fine.

**Williams:** Fuckin- Yeah... yeah, I get it.

**Fischer:** Alright. Good. 

**SCP-6229:** ...if you wanted to be team lead you could&#39;ve just asked, I would&#39;ve been fine with that.

**Fischer:** Just making it easier for you, chief.

**Pilot:** 10 minutes till drop. Get ready.

//SCP-6229 stands up and reorients the camera onto itself.//

**SCP-6229:** I&#39;ll be leaving first then. If anyone asks, Mark&#39;s in charge.

**Fischer:** See you on the ground, chief.

Prometheus is a company, not a charity. Besides, it&#39;s not my department and we have plenty of other able-bodied individuals. 

Of course, if you&#39;re willing to renegotiate the terms of your contract, Mr. Hao, I could try and pull a few strings here and there.

//SCP-6229 sits at a desk in what appears to be an office. Sitting across the desk is Williams and Fischer.//

**Fischer:** Zhu, are you sure about this?

**SCP-6229:** I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, I don&#39;t know why you two are here.

**Fischer:** Word trickled down. How long are you contracted for?

//SCP-6229 is silent.//

**Williams:** Look, I ain&#39;t one to get worried about anyone else. But from what I&#39;ve been hearin&#39;? It ain&#39;t lookin&#39; too good for you, chief.

**Fischer:** You could&#39;ve at least asked us for help. If we knew your situation...

**SCP-6229:** Fischer, you&#39;ve been dating that girl for how long now?

**Fischer:** What? Uh, three years in a month.

**SCP-6229:** And you, Williams. How much do you send to that orphanage every month?

**Williams:** How do you know about that? Hell, not even //they// know I&#39;m the one sendin&#39; it.

**SCP-6229:** All of you, Felicia included, have people counting on you. 

**Fischer:** So do you, Zhu!

**SCP-6229:** I have a different situation, Mark. My contract has only been extended for an additional year. I know what it&#39;s like to watch a loved one wither away in a hospital. It&#39;s not something anyone decent deserves to suffer, much less my own team.

**SCP-6229:** That&#39;s not good.

**Williams:** Who the fuck are they? Insurgency?

**Fischer:** Probably. And looks like they brought a stabilizer with them.

**SCP-6229:** That&#39;ll makes things difficult for me. Fischer, can you deal with it?

**Fischer:** Maybe? I&#39;ve got an RPG, but I don&#39;t know how much armor that thing&#39;s packing.

**Ahlin:** Either way, we&#39;re looking at prolonged combat, yes?

**SCP-6229:** Likely, I&#39;m picking up at least twenty lifeforms.

**Williams:** Ahem. Um, in that case...

//Williams pulls out a deck of cards and hands a card to Fischer and one to Ahlin, who accepts it hesitantly.//

**Fischer:** Jack, what is this?

**Williams:** It&#39;s a, uh, ahem, what I call an emergency card. It&#39;s got enough power to fix a bullet wound or two.

**Ahlin:** ...really? 

**Williams:** Oi, don&#39;t get any ideas, a&#39;right? I&#39;m just payin&#39; back my dues. For last time.

//Williams and Ahlin stand before a small abandoned apartment complex. Ahlin holds a small sack in her left hand. The door has been boarded up and an occult symbol is painted upon it.//

**SCP-6229:** Camera&#39;s up, let&#39;s get moving.

**Williams:** Fuckin&#39; finally. Seriously, you need Golds to take a look. It&#39;s startin&#39; to piss me off.

//SCP-6229 ignores Williams and begins prying off the boards with its hands.//

**SCP-6229:** Felicia, do you recognize this symbol?

**Ahlin:** If I had to guess, I&#39;d say it&#39;s an attempted rendition of the Library&#39;s symbol, but it&#39;s poorly done.

**SCP-6229:** Alright, this is the right spot then. Jack, are the charges ready to deploy?

**Williams:** Yeah, I set them up while you were fiddling with your camera. Fuckin&#39; Mark, leavin&#39; me to do his job. When&#39;d he have time to go and meet a girl anyways? And you too, Feli, why am I the only one with no one to hold me at night?

**Ahlin:** You do know most women like a man who&#39;s got positive personality traits, right?

**Williams:** What? I do have positive personality traits! Like the size of my-

**SCP-6229:** If we could focus, please. Let Mark enjoy his honeymoon. Unless you want him to come back with another of his &#39;team bonding activities&#39; again.

**Williams:** Yeah yeah, I get it.

//Williams leans backwards and cracks his back. He pulls out a deck of standard playing cards and hands a card to Ahlin. She accepts it without looking and slips it into her pocket.//

**Williams:** So, you going in guns blazin&#39;?

**SCP-6229:** Yep. Ahlin, bring in the sack. Jack, follow behind Ahlin, but keep your eyes on the outside. I&#39;m going in.

//SCP-6229 steps back several paces from the door while Ahlin and Williams move to either side of the door. SCP-6229 accelerates towards the door and breaks through. A bright light flashes, followed by a loud crack. Camera reorients to natural light levels. Two individuals, a male and female, stand near the far end of the room. The male stands in front and holds both hands outstretched towards SCP-6229 while the female appears to be holding a ball of fire in her right hand.//

**Unknown Male:** Identify yourselves.

**SCP-6229:** Prometheus Labs, we&#39;re here for the disc.

**Unknown Male:** I&#39;m afraid you can&#39;t have it. It&#39;s been sold already, and not to you.

**SCP-6229:** The sale&#39;s been compromised. Insurgency&#39;s on their way already.

**Unknown Male:** Right, and I&#39;m supposed to just hand it over to Prometheus then?

**SCP-6229:** Prometheus is willing to buy it from you at the prior agreed price and take you into protective custody.

**Unknown Male:** Do you think I&#39;m going to believe everything you say? I&#39;ve got no reason to trust you and I know what Prometheus does. I&#39;m not too keen on selling this to them, you understand?

**Williams:** Chief, I see a couple of really suspicious cars.

**SCP-6229:**Got it, Jack. Felicia, get out there and keep them busy. Jack, place the charges on the perimeter.

//Ahlin drops the sack and leaves the room with Williams.//

**SCP-6229:** Listen. The Insurgency is on their way and you know that the Hand isn&#39;t going to take kindly to you. I&#39;m sure you could take care of the Insurgency on your own. I know what you&#39;re capable of. But you do that, you&#39;re painting a target on yourself. Right now, no one knows who you are or what you look like. Prometheus deals in technology, not information. Sell us the disc and you walk away free.

**Unknown Female:** You&#39;re alone right now and there&#39;s two of us. How about you hand over the bag you have there and we don&#39;t turn you to scrap?

//SCP-6229 sighs and crosses its arms.//

**SCP-6229:** You can certainly try, but you&#39;d just be wasting time.

//The Unknown Female throws the fireball in her hand at SCP-6229. Temperature readings briefly reach 150°C.//

**SCP-6229:** Are you satisfied now? Or do you want to try once more, just in case?

//The two individuals are silent for a moment. The Unknown Male lowers his arms and speaks with the Unknown Female for a period of time. Sounds of gunfire begin behind SCP-6229.//

**Unknown Male:** Fine, we&#39;ll do it.

//SCP-6229 picks up the sack brought in by Ahlin and throws it over to the Unknown Male. He opens it and pulls out a silver coin.//

**Unknown Male:** Hm, this&#39;ll do.

//The Unknown Male pulls a disc case out of a pocket and throws it to SCP-6229. SCP-6229 begins to leave the building.//

**SCP-6229:** Jack, set off the charges, we&#39;re getting out of here! //SCP-6229 turns back to the unknown individuals.// You two sit tight. You&#39;ll be taken to a Prometheus holding room for thirty minutes then let go. If you so feel inclined, I&#39;m certain you can leave early with some... diplomacy. Best of luck.

//SCP-6229 turns away from the individuals and exits the building. Williams and Ahlin take cover behind the stone fencing surrounding the building. Ahlin holds an M4 and clenches her teeth as bullets  pepper into the walls of the building. Multiple Chaos Insurgency members fire upon SCP-6229. The bullets ricochet off of it.//

**SCP-6229:** Charges primed, Jack?

**Williams:** Whenever you say, chief!

**SCP-6229:** Now, preferably, Jack. I&#39;ll handle the Insurgency till then. Felicia, hand me the M4.

//Ahlin hands SCP-6229 her M4 and draws her sidearm. The two begin firing at the Chaos Insurgency members. The charges produce a loud whining sound. SCP-6229 turns towards one of the charges. Visible smoke rises from the device as the whining sound increases in volume. Williams crouches beside it, examining a remote in his hand.//

**Ahlin:** Jack, is that supposed to happen?

**Williams:** Absolutely fuckin&#39; NOT! The fuck does &#39;imminent reversal incident&#39; mean?!

**SCP-6229:** Jack, there&#39;s a lot of mercenaries out there and I&#39;m running out of bullets. Could you please hurry up-

**Williams:** Get down!

//Williams tackles Ahlin and both vanish in a puff of white smoke as a thick column of black smoke billows from behind SCP-6229, followed by a bright flash. Temperature readings exceed 800°C.//

//SCP-6229 sits in a small meeting room. Ahlin and Fischer sit in plastic folding chairs. Williams sits in a wheelchair.//

**Fischer:** -shit. No fucking way they&#39;re blaming Jack for that. Their internal records show that the displacement charges were still in the prototypical phase. I mean, the largest eruption in history? That&#39;s- They can&#39;t blame us or Jack for that.

**SCP-6229:** What does it matter? He&#39;s still alive, isn&#39;t he?

**Williams:** I mean, I am. Still whole, though crispy.

**Ahlin:** You almost died, Jack! Again! //We// almost died there. I&#39;ve accepted being shot at, being stabbed, lightning thrown at me. But Prometheus testing out prototype equipment on us? We have to draw the line somewhere.

**SCP-6229:** I draw the line at staying alive. And we are all still alive. That&#39;s what matters.

**Fischer:** Chief, this- this isn&#39;t okay.

**Williams:** Oh come the fuck on, Mark. Who gives a fuck? I&#39;m still standin&#39; here! Feli is still standing here. I mean, my leg&#39;s a bit toasty, sure, but I&#39;m fine!

**Ahlin:** You don&#39;t //have// a leg anymore, Jack!

**Williams:** I&#39;m fine otherwise!

**Fischer:** Jack-

**Williams:** I said I&#39;m fine.

**Fischer:** You&#39;re not fine. What are you supposed to do now?

**Williams:** Prometheus still has that contract with Anderson, yeah? They built the chief&#39;s suit, so I figure I can just ask for a replacement leg.

**Fischer:** There&#39;s no way Pratsky signs off on that.

**Williams:** And why the fuck do you care? Huh!? It ain&#39;t //your// fuckin&#39; leg now is it?

**Fischer:** Because I should&#39;ve been there! I could&#39;ve- should&#39;ve been there. That was my job. 

**Ahlin:** You were with your family, Mark. It&#39;s not your fault, it&#39;s mi-

**Fischer:** No, Felicia. It was my fault. I should&#39;ve been there. That was my job. And I wasn&#39;t there to do it.

//The room is silent.//

**SCP-6229:** Everyone done? I will handle this, both Jack&#39;s leg and the whole displacement charge thing. We&#39;ve done good work, Pratsky knows this. He&#39;s on our side. He won&#39;t refuse a request from me.

**SCP-6229:** Took you all long enough.

**Williams:** Oi, not all of us can just pop through the floor of a plane in flight.

**Ahlin:** Oh shut it Jack, you spent at least thirty minutes on a call with that girl you met six months ago. 

**Fischer:** I&#39;ll never know what she sees in him. God knows none of us do.

**Williams:** I&#39;ve been tellin&#39; you all this whole time, I&#39;ve got quality! I&#39;m a &#39;catch&#39;. You all just don&#39;t have good taste.

**SCP-6229:** Alright, get it together, we&#39;re wasting time. Everyone ready to go? Got Jack&#39;s blessing and all?

//The team nods and chuckles slightly while Williams scoffs.//

**SCP-6229:** Let&#39;s get this over with then.

//SCP-6229 turns back around and pushes open the door to the studio. A single, ornate floor mirror stands in the center of the room. A wooden chair can be seen in the mirror despite there not being a chair in the room.//

**Williams:** That right there&#39;s what we&#39;re after, right? Mirror portal or whatever?

**SCP-6229:** The very same. I&#39;ll take the back, you guys grab the front. Let&#39;s move quick. We want to be out of here before anyone else gets here. Be careful with it, Pratsky says info told him it&#39;ll stop working if it so much as cracks.

//SCP-6229 moves forward and grabs the mirror from the back. Williams steps forward, but stops short of the mirror.//

**Williams:** Uh, anyone else seeing- OH FUCK!

//Chains shoot forward, seemingly out of the mirror, and wrapping around the other members of the team, restraining their arms and legs. SCP-6229 runs to the other side of the mirror. The chains have wrapped around the throats. SCP-6229 turns to face the mirror. A man in a suit is now sitting on the chair within the mirror. Large piles of chains lay around his legs, extending through the mirror.//

**Unknown Suit:** Ah! There you are. Glad you could join us, Hao, I can call you that, right?

**SCP-6229:** You may not.

//SCP-6229 moves directly in front of the mirror.//

**Unknown Suit:** Well, call me Set. Y&#39;know, I&#39;ve been watching you for quite some time now, Hao.

**SCP-6229:** You&#39;re talking quite a lot for a man hiding in a pocket universe.

**Set:** True enough. But it works when it comes to you, and I know all about you. So, let&#39;s have a little chat.

**SCP-6229:** Release my team and we can talk.

**Set:** Mm, no. You don&#39;t have that kind of leverage. You listen and you answer, or I turn your team into ground beef.

**SCP-6229:** Hm. How about no?

//SCP-6229 punches the mirror, shattering it. The chains fall to the floor, releasing the team.//

**SCP-6229:** Is everyone alright?

**Fischer:** //Coughs.// Yeah, I think we&#39;re alright.

**Williams:** Speak for yourself, I ain&#39;t gonna be eating normally for weeks.

**Ahlin:** Who the hell was-

//The sounds of Set laughing can be heard.//

**Set:** Wow, okay. I thought you&#39;d be fast, but not that fast. 

**Williams:** He&#39;s not dead?!

//The chains animate again and quickly wrap around the throats of the agents. SCP-6229 is left alone.//

**Set:** You know... I&#39;ve practiced this speech over and over again for the last four months. And now? I can barely remember it.

**SCP-6229:** Let them go.

**Set:** No, I won&#39;t waste time. You took //everything// from me... so let me take everything from you.

//A series of crunching noises is audible. The three agents fall limp as the chains fall inanimate again.//

**SCP-6229:** ...no. No no no no no no no no.

**Set:** //Sighs.// That&#39;s exactly what I wanted to hear. Are you proud of me brother?

//SCP-6229 gently puts Williams down before moving over to Ahlin and attempting to wake her. She is unresponsive.//

**SCP-6229:** ...why?

**Set:** Revenge, simple as that. My brother trusted you. And you killed him in cold blood. But just killing them was too easy, no, you had to drop an entire fucking volcano on them, didn&#39;t you? Your director //graciously// showed me the video after I found where his family lived.

**SCP-6229:** I... what...?

**Set:** And did you know this chair was meant for your dad too? Well, you can&#39;t see the chair because you broke the mirror like the big fucking idiot you are, but that&#39;s what that was for. It was really quite unfortunate for me when I found he&#39;d been dead for two years.

//SCP-6229 stops.//

**SCP-6229:** What.

**Set:** Oh... you didn&#39;t know, right. My bad. Nobody told you. Well, I&#39;m off then. I&#39;ve done what I needed to do. Tell Wayne I said hi.

**SCP-6229:** Where is Doctor Whitaker?

**Richards:** He&#39;s been transferred. My name is Angela Richards, pleasure to meet you.

//SCP-6229 is silent.//

**Richards:** Right, um, let me get right to the point. I&#39;ve read your file, and I see that you&#39;ve got quite the resume.

//SCP-6229 is silent.//

**Richards:** Hm, you&#39;re not a talker, I understand. We all have our off days.

**SCP-6229:** What do you want from me, Dr. Richards?

**Richards:** Just Richards will do, I don&#39;t have a doctorate. 

**SCP-6229:** What do you want, Richards?

**Richards:** Well, um, I want //you//. Well, I say &#34;I&#34;, but what I mean is, //we// want you.

**SCP-6229:** We?

**Richards:** Yes, we. The Ethics Committee is quite interested in you. You know, we were afraid that Overwatch would get their hands on you before us. I&#39;m just saying, &#34;functionally indestructible&#34;, &#34;ignores external anomalous behaviors or triggers&#34;, &#34;can phase through physical objects&#34;, //&#34;emotional baggage&#34;//. You&#39;re practically perfect.

**SCP-6229:** What. Do. You. Want.

**Richards:** Okay, alright. We have a proposition for you. We want you to work for us, Ben.

**SCP-6229:** What reason do I have to work for the Foundation?

**Richards:** Well... you&#39;d be able to do a lot of good for the world. You&#39;ve been around the block for a while now, Ben. You know what we do and how we do it. There are people out there, in situations like you found yourself all those years ago. We can help them.

**SCP-6229:** You want me to do what I did at Prometheus? Are you sure you read my file? Because the last man who I did that for ended up getting shot.

**Richards:** And that&#39;s why we&#39;re interested in you. The Ethics Committee has their eyes on a lot of personnel, both outside and inside the Foundation. We do have Omega-1. They&#39;re incredibly useful, but we&#39;ve had... incidents in the past. Irreparable damage done to innocent lives because we weren&#39;t fast enough to stop a corrupt few. 

**SCP-6229:** I&#39;m not interested. I didn&#39;t kill Pratsky out of a sense of justice.

**Richards:** Fair enough. I thought I&#39;d have to use this so...

//Richards pushes over a folder to SCP-6229. It opens the folder and reads the enclosed document.//

**Richards:** Do you recognize her?

**SCP-6229:** No.

**Richards:** Her name is Evelyn Agapov. Orphaned when her single mother died of hypothermia and then adopted by a rather affluential Russian couple. 23 years old and currently employed with the Foundation. Studied biochemistry at Dartmouth. A smart woman, by all metrics.

**SCP-6229:** And?

**Richards:** And... the biological daughter of Jack Williams, former Acquisitions Agent of Prometheus Labs.

//SCP-6229 laughs.//

**SCP-6229:** Do you expect me to believe that?

**Richards:** Check the next page, it&#39;s a paternity test we conducted not even a week ago. 99.5% match.

**SCP-6229:** And I&#39;m supposed to believe that none of this information is forged? That the Foundation of all organizations wouldn&#39;t stoop to something as lowly as //lying// to get what they wanted?

**Richards:** I expected you to say that. 

//Richards pulls out a cellphone and dials a number.//

**Richards:** Yes. Mhm. Payment&#39;s on its way. Send the results to my location. Mhm. Thank you.

//A large black package manifests on the desk. A large, stylized MC&amp;D is imprinted on its side.//

**Richards:** Here we are, this is an MC&amp;D full genetic testing report. We put in a delayed-payment order on it just in case you were feeling stubborn. Open it. 

//SCP-6229 opens the box and shuffles through several papers.//

**Richards:** Luckily for us, MC&amp;D have a reputation to uphold. Can&#39;t be caught lying about something as trivial as this, not even for us.

**SCP-6229:** ...what do you intend to do with her?

**Richards:** Work with us, and we&#39;ll make sure she&#39;s never put in danger, even if she leaves our employment. We&#39;re allowed to authorize the use of a few extremely limited SCPs to keep her alive if necessary. Otherwise... well, you should know working with the anomalous comes with risks.

**SCP-6229:** You&#39;re desperate, aren&#39;t you?

**Richards:** Like I said... there&#39;s a lot of Pratskys in the world. People who&#39;ll do anything to get what they want. You&#39;ll have a chance to stop them before what happened to you happens to anyone else. Do you accept our proposition?

**SCP-6229:** ...it&#39;s not like I really have a choice, do I?
