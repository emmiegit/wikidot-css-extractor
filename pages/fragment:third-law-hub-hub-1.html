If this is your first time reading Third Law, and you&#39;re looking for a good place to begin, here are some tales and articles that we recommend as possible starting points. You don&#39;t have to read all of them! Any one can give you a good base to explore other parts of the canon at your own pace. Some are heavy worldbuilding pieces that serve as a launching point for organically exploring the universe, while others are more iconic standalone pieces that can give you a feel for the canon&#39;s tone and themes.

* **[[[The Bard of Ambrose]]]** -- A man and his computer debate the nature of consciousness in a story about an artificial intelligence that believes it&#39;s as conscious as its creators: which is to say, not at all. //Written by GreenWolf//
* **[[[The Analog Kid]]]** -- The dream of transhumanism is alive in Three Portlands, as a trio of scientists try to crack the secret of electronic telepathy. Just remember, it isn&#39;t a hive mind. //Written by GreenWolf//
* **[[[Moonlighting]]]** -- One part character study, one part cyberpunk mood piece, Moonlighting is a tale about an amateur anartist putting himself into his work and the ways that we suffer for our art. //Written by A Random Day//
* **[[[preliminary-report|Preliminary Report of J.â€ŠC. Randall...]]]** -- This article fleshes out a large portion of the canon&#39;s cosmology and alternate history, while also providing a modern, multi-universal take on the pioneering spirit of Golden Age science fiction. //Written by GreenWolf//
* **[[[Under Control]]]** -- Corporate malpractice, sovereign citizens, and a special hell. This tale distills the car-crash of the mundane and the anomalous that is daily life in Three Portlands, seen through the eyes of an unhappy medium in an unhappy medium. //Written by TyGently//
* **[[[Operation LLEWYN DARK]]]** -- When a stray space rock ends up causing a worldwide paratech catastrophe, the Foundation and the Horizon Initiative join hands to clean up an industrial accident on the final frontier. //Written by Taffeta//
* **[[[scp-2664|SCP-2664 - Redline]]]** -- A slice of surreal mind/body horror set at the peak of Cold War hysteria, this article explores the geopolitics of the world behind the Veil, and asks just how much wrong you can do for the right reasons. //Written by A Random Day//
* **[[[the-seltzorcism |Overheard At Deer]]]** -- It is a beautiful day at Deer College and you are a horrible seltzer water. //Written by ch00bakka and A Random Day//
* **[[[Minneapolis Burns]]]** -- It&#39;s 1985 and Minnesota is on fire, courtesy of the Foundation&#39;s newly acquired battlemage, Florence Elsinger. Learn the flawed and fiery history of the first Special Asset Task Force, as it deals with the remnants of the 7th Occult War, the secret politics of Overwatch Command, and the challenges of living underneath Lake Superior. //Written by GreenWolf//
* **[[[A Little Bit Of Help]]]** -- Sinister cultists, ritual thaumaturgy, ancient tombs, and the best first date anyone has ever had. An introduction to those most explosive of GOC wizards, the Gormogons, and an exploration of Third Law&#39;s most consistent thematic element: lesbians. //Written by ch00bakka//
* **[[[Hypervelocity]]]** -- A junkie witch injects demons into her veins to rob a cursed bank. The rebirth of the Chicago Spirit is just another day in the life of Rukmini Mahakali. //Written by A Random Day//
