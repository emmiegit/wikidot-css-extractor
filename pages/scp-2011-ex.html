[[span class=&#34;bigtext&#34;]]SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:[[/span]] N/A

[[span class=&#34;bigtext&#34;]]DESCRIPTION (ARCHIVED):[[/span]] SCP-2011 is Sir Paul McCartney&#39;s &#34;[*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EeTkF-SLxE Temporary Secretary]&#34;, an electro-pop song released on the 1980 album //McCartney II//. SCP-2011&#39;s lyrics depict the singer&#39;s requests to &#39;Mister Marks&#39; to send them a &#39;Temporary Secretary&#39; for reasons unstated, detailing the various requirements which she would not have to fulfill.

A remastered version of SCP-2011 was released on 2011/01/01 and subsequently endangered the life of O5-4. It has since been declared a Class-4 audiohazard, and made provisionally inaccessible to the public. Research as to its anomalous nature is ongoing.

= [[span class=&#34;bigtext&#34;]]ADDENDUM 2011-EX-1:[[/span]] Context

When questioned as to why he wrote SCP-2011, McCartney stated:

&gt; //&#34;It&#39;s like a disposable secretary, and it struck me as being funny. The song is written from the point of view of a fellow who just wants a disposable secretary, and he&#39;s writing to a bureau to try and get one. I just like the idea. I just thought it was funny, you know, asking for a temporary secretary rather than a secretary.&#34;//

Evidently, this clarifies nothing.

**D-11064:** its weird i guess?

**O5-4:** Elaborate.

**D-11064:** i mean, that synth sound is kind of starnge
*strange

**O5-4:** Right, but how do you feel?

lmao this is ridiculous

**O5-4:** You don&#39;t feel any adverse effects?

**D-11064:** no? its a super weird song though

= //&lt;D-11064 laughs, pressing one hand to his headphones. After a few more moments, he takes them off.&gt;//

**D-11064:** holy fuck that was it? LMAO

**PoI-2011:** You jus&#39; gonna keep staring at me, or...?

**O5-4:** Sir McCartney, I have no doubt you&#39;ve got many questions. It&#39;s not often we drag in civilians, especially not here.

**PoI-2011:** I haven&#39;t broken any laws, I&#39;ll tell you that much, so if you&#39;re with the government or something, you can piss off. I&#39;ve got a concert to be at right now, and --

**O5-4:** What the //fuck// is a temporary secretary?

**PoI-2011:** Sorry, what?

**O5-4:** You heard me. You want to get back to your tour? Answer the question.

= //&lt;Brief pause.&gt;//

**PoI-2011:** Have you got your head on backwards? You&#39;ve arrested me so you can ask me about a song? Where the hell d&#39;you get off?

= //&lt;O5-4 slams his fist on his desk.&gt;//

**O5-4:** You call that mess a //song//? Not only do the lyrics make no sense whatsoever, but you&#39;ve got this god-awful synth tone playing a fucking twelve-tone-row in my ears! You&#39;ve gotta be shitting me with this, Paul.

= //&lt;Another pause. O5-4 takes a deep breath.&gt;//

**O5-4:** So, again, I&#39;ll ask you. What the hell is going on with that song?

= //&lt;PoI-2011 sighs, leaning back in his chair.&gt;//

**PoI-2011:** Look, I just -- I was in a dark place, right? And we needed another song for the record, we were runnin&#39; out of studio time, an&#39; I thought back to how John and George would usually take over when that happened. I had some pretty alright ideas but they&#39;d always shoot &#39;em down, and it always rubbed me wrong.

**PoI-2011:** So, I just said &#39;fuck it&#39;, right? What if I just went with whatever came to mind and wrote a song without second-guessin&#39; myself? What if I ignored John&#39;s voice in my head? What could possibly go wrong?

= //&lt;There is a long pause. O5-4 reaches into his desk drawer, producing two glasses and a bottle of whisky. He pours them each a glass.&gt;//

**O5-4:** I&#39;m sorry. I understand how that feels. I get shouted down at Council meetings more often than I&#39;d like to admit.

**PoI-2011:** ...Right. Well, yeah. I&#39;m not especially proud of the song or anything, I just wanted to try something. And some people quite like it, I guess.

= //&lt;O5-4 nods, taking a sip from his glass.&gt;//

**PoI-2011:** Why&#39;s it got you so bogged down, anyway? I mean, what&#39;d it ever do to you?

= //&lt;A brief pause.&gt;//

**O5-4:** &#34;Temporary Secretary&#34; made me crash my car, Paul.

O5-4 is no longer allowed to pursue independent research without Council approval, and the cost of a new company vehicle has been deducted from his salary.
