|| **0312:** At his routine monthly health checkup, Shek Kwai-chun&#39;s reality warping abilities were discovered to have become apparent; they appear to be repair-oriented in purpose. Data has been updated. -- Liu, Nursing Society _
 • In addition, his control over his abilities seems to be unstable. His brain and neck seem to have undergone some alteration. I suggest asking him about how he discovered his abilities. -- Liu ||
|| **0313:** An interview was arranged between Shek Kwai-chun and the mentoring group (see addendum 1). It was confirmed that his abilities were awakened due to external human intervention. I&#39;ll ask the internal affairs team to help out with [Encrypted. For Training Team and Internal Affairs Team eyes only.], and while they&#39;re at it sort out the mess he&#39;s made while in that state. -- Lee, Training Team ||
|| **0317:** Based on the tattoo Shek Kwai-chun has discovered on his body, we believe he has been affected by anomalous techniques used by the online youth paratechnological group &#34;Gamers Against Weed&#34;. I&#39;ve asked the karmic sciences graduates from the external affairs team to track down the relations between Kwai-chun and Gamers Against Weed. -- Lee, Training Team ||
|| **0318:** We received a document from Gamers Against Weed (see addendum 4), confirming that Kwai-chun&#39;s state is something to do with Gamers Against Weed&#39;s &#34;fake Little Misters&#34; project. By the first stipulation of our school&#39;s External Affairs Guidelines, we have put in a request to the external affairs team to take action against the Gamers Against Weed members responsible. -- Lee, Training Team ||
|| **0320:** We have traced Shek Kwai-chun&#39;s condition to two members of Gamers Against Weed, and have applied &#34;appropriate retribution&#34; to them: branding &#34;scum that attacks innocent students, Gamers Against Weed&#34; on their faces.  -- B.L., External Affairs Team ||
|| **0331:** According to information compiled by the internal affairs team, [Encrypted. For Internal Affairs Team and Training Team eyes only.], our school&#39;s study of reality-warping abilities was not enough to deal with his loss of control. In the worst case, we&#39;ll need to force his abilities back to being latent using the &#34;Weiken Repression Ritual&#34;, but there is a high chance that his reality-warping abilities will simply disappear. We&#39;ll consult with Kwai-chun himself for his opinion. -- Lee, Training Team ||
|| **0401:** I have seen Shek Kwai-chun&#39;s profile. The training team&#39;s response was excellent. His talents have plenty of potential. I do not wish for them to disappear like this. I will talk to the Hang Tan side about this. The best seedlings need the best environments to grow. -- Principal, Supervisory Board ||
|| **0405:** As arranged by the principal, Shek Kwai-chun has been fast-tracked into the 2013-14 exchange group, and will be joining the students at Hang Tan Secondary for a short-term exchange learning program. We hope they can help him control his abilities. -- Lee, Training Team ||
|| **0415:** Shek Kwai-chun has been temporarily transferred to Hong Shing Hang Tan College for the third semester of this year. His file has been updated. -- Wong ||

&gt; //&lt;Begin Recording&gt;//
&gt; **Koo:** Is this thing on? Very good. Let&#39;s begin. Hello, Shek Kwai-chun. I am a volunteer from the student guidance department. You can call me Ocean, or A-hoi. To begin with, do you have any questions as to why you are here?
&gt; **Shek:** Yes... um, is this related to yesterday&#39;s health checkup?
&gt; **Koo:** This... um, yes, it is a little. But right now I just want to hear a little something from you. Have you suffered any headaches or auditory hallucinations in the past few days?
&gt; **Shek:** How did you know? It started to ache after I went out drinking with my friends two days ago. It was a pulling pain, like something was cramped in there. Super annoying.
&gt; **Koo:** Oh? But you didn&#39;t say anything yesterday.
&gt; **Shek:** When I woke up yesterday, it had stopped. I thought it was just a hangover, so I didn&#39;t tell the school, and you didn&#39;t ask, anyway.
&gt; **Koo:** Uh-huh. And any auditory hallucinations? Did you suddenly start hearing noises or anything like that?
&gt; **Shek:** That too. When I was sleeping, my dream was about the same as usual, but I thought I heard a lot of people singing, though I couldn&#39;t make out what they were singing. Even then, it didn&#39;t happen again last night.
&gt; **Koo:** That singing, do you still remember anything about it?
&gt; **Shek:** No. It was really intense, and it was in a dream. Do you remember the dream you had two nights ago?
&gt; **Koo:** Of course, that night I dreamt I [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/i-see-fire|killed my niece]]] with my bare hands, haha. But that can&#39;t have happened, because my sister doesn&#39;t even have a partner.
&gt; **Koo:** Huh, why are you so stunned? Remembering your dreams is easy if you put in a little practice. If you&#39;re interested, I... won&#39;t teach you, haha.
&gt; **Shek:** Who even cares!
&gt; **Koo:** Alright, alright, I&#39;ll stop. So, you said earlier that you went out drinking with your friends three days ago? Do you still remember anything about that?
&gt; **Shek:** Of course, my surname isn&#39;t &#34;Gold&#34; and my last name isn&#39;t &#34;Fish&#34;. At that time, I met up with my online rhythm game friend group. We wanted to go for karaoke. I wasn&#39;t lame, so I went with them.
&gt; **Koo:** Oh, an offline meeting? Did anyone in particular stand out to you?
&gt; **Shek:** Oh, of course, you see, out of the ten people who went, six said they were girls in the chat. Turns out, three of them were guys, two of them were also guys but crossdressing, and only one was a real girl. How silly and naive I was to believe them!
&gt; **Koo:** That&#39;s sad. Did you make any new friends?
&gt; **Shek:** That night we had a lot of fun, but the two I had the most connection with were A-long and A-tian. 
&gt; **Koo:** Huh. And why did you hit it off with those two specifically?
&gt; **Shek:** They usually play jubeat, just like me, and they always go for full combos.
&gt; **Koo:** Full combos? Doesn&#39;t that take a lot of effort and skill?
&gt; **Shek:** Huh? A-hai, you also play rhythm games? To put it simply, if I had to choose between high score and full combo, I&#39;d go for full combo and  use //anmitsu// [[footnote]]A technique used in rhythm games, foregoing accuracy for maintaining combo by tapping several notes supposed to be tapped in quick succession at the same time.[[/footnote]] to make it easier. That&#39;s my style, at least.
&gt; **Koo:** Really? I personally go for high score. Once you get good enough, full combos aren&#39;t that hard either.
&gt; **Shek:** That I can&#39;t do. I&#39;m not a //gorilla-ningen//[[footnote]]**Translator&#39;s note:** A Japanese slang term used in the rhythm game community, used to describe a person who easily clears extremely difficult charts.[[/footnote]], and if it weren&#39;t for A-long and A-tian, I&#39;d probably have to train another few years before I could get a full combo.
&gt; **Koo:** They taught you to do that? What did they teach besides &#34;just practice&#34;?
&gt; **Shek:** To put it simply, it&#39;s the lack of skill. A-tian said they had a way to raise my skill level. At that point I was pretty drunk, so I tried their tricks and they weren&#39;t lying, it was legit!
&gt; **Koo:** How do you do it in practice?
&gt; **Shek:** Uh, A-tian got out a big book, A-long drew a circle in it in beer, and they chanted some incantations that went like &#34;Lemuria in the sea&#34;. I can&#39;t remember.
&gt; **Koo:** And then how did you know it worked?
&gt; **Shek:** Well, the next day I went down to the SmartArcade to play some games, and even on the songs I always choked on, I thought of what they said and used their techniques. Even though my score wasn&#39;t very high, it was a full combo!
&gt; **Koo:** Hm, and did you use that technique on other games?
&gt; **Shek:** Of course. Yesterday I played some DRMF[[footnote]] Abbreviation for //DoReMiFa//, a mobile rhythm game produced by [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/letters|Letters Entertainment]]] of the [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/SCP-CN-1997|Right Phase]]]. [[/footnote]], and full combo&#39;d every song I tried as well. It was so cool, if I hadn&#39;t needed to send my phone to be fixed I&#39;d play some more!
&gt; **Koo:** So that&#39;s why... Hm, then there is nothing else I need to know. Thanks for your cooperation. Tomorrow we&#39;ll send you anything you need to know from the checkup report... oh, yes, Shek, one more thing.
&gt; **Shek:** What is it, sir?
&gt; **Koo:** Personally, I&#39;d like to remind you. Go to the library and look up Ms. Blavatsky&#39;s exploits and masterworks. You&#39;re falling behind on thaumaturgy.

&gt; **18:20:15** The student in question, wearing winter attire, enters and approaches the &#34;jubeat[[footnote]]An arcade rhythm game produced by Left Phase video game company Konami.[[/footnote]]&#34; machine in a corner of the arcade.
&gt; **18:20:58** The student inserts a coin into the jubeat machine and begins a game.
&gt; **18:22:20** The student completes one round, attaining a high score but breaking his combo in the middle of the song.
&gt; **18:22:28** The student reattempts the same song on his second round.
&gt; **18:23:32** The student loses his combo at the same point. He begins to angrily strike the game screen, cutting the game short. At this time, the video shows light signs of reality distortion.
&gt; **18:23:40** The student continues the game, completing the second round with barely enough score to pass.
&gt; **18:24:00** The student reattempts the same song on his third and final round.

&gt; **18:26:41** The student celebrates loudly, using his phone to take a photo of his results.

&gt; **18:32:14** A [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scarlet-s-personnel-file|youth in a scarlet coat]]] attempts to play on the same machine. The intense //bouhatsu// effect on the machine renders the game difficult to play.

||||||~ Reported By||Junior Mediator Atreus||
|||||||| The following records document Shek Kwai-chun&#39;s use of his talents on campus, as requested by the training team. ||
||||||||~ 2013/03/14 ||
||||||~ Location||East Campus, Multipurpose Activity Building, Room 307||
||||||~ Situation||Shek Kwai-chun retrieved circuit parts from an unidentified source and, over the course of half an hour, completed work on an incomplete server rack. _
Kwai-chun turned on the server to test it, showing that it was operational; however, three hours later, the server short-circuited and burned down.||
||||||~ Remarks||**0314:** _
• This server was a personal project of Shek&#39;s. Planning and construction began in mid-August of 2012. However, it was temporarily shelved on October 5 the same year. This is the first time since then he has worked on it. _
• During the process, fifteen reality distortion waves were recorded. Of these, five occurred when Shek manifested tools, another five occurred when he manifested parts, and the last five occurred in tandem with breakdowns caused by short-circuits occurring while he was testing the server. _
 _
**0315:** _
• After examination of the damaged server, the faulty parts were identified as the five parts produced by Shek&#39;s anomalous abilities. _
• Hume levels of the tools and parts produced by Shek&#39;s abilities were stable and have not reduced; however, it was noticed that they underwent a different degree of wear and structural damage. It is a miracle that the server was even able to run for three hours, although whether that was a result of Shek&#39;s abilities is unknown. ||
||||||||~ - 2013/03/17 ||
||||||~ Location||—||
||||||~ Situation||Shek Kwai-chun anonymously released a singleplayer game titled &#34;Half-Life 3: Doujin Edition&#34; on forums based in Hong Shing, including internal school forums. It was downloaded over 500,000 times in the first 24 hours.||
||||||~ Remarks||**0317:** _
• The game is a sidescrolling action-shooter game developed using the Source[[footnote]] A game engine developed by Valve Software for the game //Half-Life 2//. [[/footnote]] engine, with a story continuing on from //Half-Life 2: Episode 2//. _
• The game uses assets from Half-Life 2 and was developed by Shek Kwai-chun over the course of two days, with over 40 reality distortion effects recorded during development.  _
 _
**0318:** _
• The overwhelming majority of players gave the game poor reviews. The main issues with the game were found to be the controls, the presence of bugs leading to crashes, and the poor quality of the story compared to the original //Half-Life// series. However, some reviews were positive, stating that &#34;the game provides a satisfying conclusion to the //Half-Life// series&#34;. _
• Other reviews found issue with the bait-and-switch nature of the marketing, involving taglines such as &#34;Half-Life 3 is finally out!&#34; and &#34;Gaben finally learned to count to 3!&#34;. _
 _
**0320:** _
• The external affairs team has attempted to suppress distribution of the game, and has notified the Foundation of the Left Phase and the Zhujihui of the Right Phase in order to prevent the game from leaking outside of Hong Shing. _
• Upon inquiry, Shek stated that he had played //Half-Life 2// and its sequel, and was overcome by the need to create a &#34;conclusion&#34;. He was compelled to spend the next two days creating the game. ||
||||||||~ - 2013/03/22||
||||||~ Location||Main Campus, [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/the-eve-of-graduation|Main Library]]], East Wing，Fifth Floor||
||||||~ Situation||While visiting the reading area, Shek Kwai-chun produced parchment and a brush and wrote a total of 573 pages with 360,000 characters in the span of three hours, then bound them into four leatherbound books. Following this, the lunch bell rang and Shek hurriedly left the area, leaving behind a complete set of books.||
||||||~ Remarks||**0322:** _
• These four books are titled: //[[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/SCP-CN-326|Revolving Sounds: Intermission]]]//, //Myriad Genealogies of Death and Rebirth//, //[[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/lucky-vacuum|Lost Record of Heroes]]]//, and //Rebirth Conditions//. These clearly correspond to four books of the self-sustaining narrative //Becaloid//. _
• These four books follow the style of existing books in the series, continuing the story from the [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/cn-326-b|750th year of the Fourth Period]]] to the first year of the Fifth Period, covering over 250 years of unrecorded narrative. _
• All pages have a telepathic sound effect, suggesting that these books are a credible account of the history of the //Becaloid// universe. _
• During the entire process, Shek produced over 600 reality distortion waves, of which 579 small waves were caused when he manifested pen and parchment, 4 slightly larger waves were caused when he bound the books, and the remainder occurred while he was writing. _
 _
**0323:** _
• The books have been shown to //Becaloid// scholars of the Genesis Association, who praised the writing and said that the writing was logically consistent and perfectly followed the style of the four existing books, being almost identical to the original books. _
 _
 //You know what the best thing is? First off, he linked the Old History and the [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/SCP-CN-570|New History]]] together, filling the gap in the history and making it complete. And then I looked through all the pages, **all of them** sounded like they were the real deal -- I almost suspected that the author could have crawled out of that lost era himself. These books are the most remarkable histories in decades, please give them to us... no, make us a copy. -- Mia, Genesis Association// _
 _
**0325:** _
• The four books have started to rapidly age starting from around noon yesterday. By now, the books&#39; physical state is now extremely fragile. In addition, the contents have also undergone significant deterioration; the grammar is poor, there are many logical inconsistencies, and even the handwriting has become illegible. The telepathic sound effect has also disappeared. _

||||||~ Location||East Campus，[[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/SCP-CN-070|Lin Muru Building]]] Construction Site||
||||||~ Situation||While passing by the construction site, Shek Kwai-chun ran into the unfinished Lin Muru Building, bypassing the guards, and began to manifest various building materials to complete the unfinished part of the building. The next day, Shek Kwai-chun was found unconscious on the roof of the building.||
||||||~ Remarks||**0329:** _
• After Shek entered the building, a total of 20 extremely large reality distortion waves were recorded over the course of the next day. These waves disrupted nearby boundaries, forming a zone of spatial turbulence around the building that prevented students and staff, including the boundary team, from entering. _
 _
**0330:** _
• According to measurements made by the civil engineering and architecture students, the completed Lin Muru Building was not built in accordance with regulations and design standards. The current Lin Muru Building was deemed too dangerous to be kept and it was decided that the building would be demolished and rebuilt in accordance with standards. _
 _
**0331：** _
• Shek Kwai-chun awoke this morning. According to his testimony, he was complaining about how slow the progress on the construction of the new school building was when he suddenly lost control of his body. He lost consciousness after the completion of the building. _
• Later, Shek will submit an application for leave to you people at the training team. _
 _
//We have received the application and are in the process of considering it. However, we believe that taking leave is only an escape from his problems, and will not address the real problems he is facing. Although every student&#39;s talent is valuable, if it comes to it, we may have to erase his talent as a last resort. -- Lee, Training Team// ||
