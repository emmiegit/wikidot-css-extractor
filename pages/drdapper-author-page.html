**Item #:** SCP-████

**Object Class:** Safe? Keter? One of the two...

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment of the object is neither possible nor necessary. If it is spotted in a facility, run.

**Description:** SCP-████ is a 4ft[[footnote]]fucking goblin[[/footnote]] humanoid entity. It has a blocky body structure, and its skin is a red pigment. Many have pointed out similarities to the main character in the video game &#34;████ ████&#34;.

SCP-████ will manifest at a Foundation facility 5 minutes prior to a catastrophic event. This is usually a mass containment breach or GoI raid. In all instances, SCP-████ dies a horrific (and sometimes humorous) death. These deaths include:

* Death by gunshot
* Death by stabbing
* Death by asphyxiation
* Death by closing door
* Death by falling filing cabinet
* Death by falling piano
* Death by what was in the canister[[footnote]] It&#39;s best you don&#39;t ask [[/footnote]]
* Death by Market Gardener
* Death by stubbing the pinky toe at just the right angle and force
* Death by「ZA HANDO」
* Death by fall damage
* Death by anti-cheat

**Addendum:** Following manifestation #18, a notebook titled &#34;Works by [[*user DrDapper]]&#34; was found on SCP-████&#39;s mutilated corpse. Documented below is everything found within the notebook.

[[tab Contact]]
+ ##black|Contact##

------

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
&#34;There are many ways to get into contact with me. The easiest and most convenient will be through Wikidot PMs. My DMs are also always open on [https://twitter.com/DrDapperTF2 Twitter], [https://discord.com/channels/@me/472222098090098688 Discord], and (if you&#39;re really desperate) [https://steamcommunity.com/id/drdappertf2/ Steam].

I usually respond within 12 hours of contact, though it may take longer depending on how life is going. Unfortunately, more personal info such as my phone number and personal email aren&#39;t know by anyone on the Wiki (including wiki friends). If I don&#39;t respond to any of what&#39;s listed above, then consider me unreachable.&#34;

(PS: If you do contact me, PLEASE don’t just send me a DM message saying “hey” or “can I talk you to.” Let me know you’re reaching me from the Wiki, other wise I’m just going to assume you’re a scammer and block you.)

&#34;In the event I, [[*user DrDapper]], end up dead, banned, publicly announce I quit writing for the Wiki, show no wiki/sandbox activity for 6 months, or do not respond to PMs for 3 months, ownership of all of my works with the //iris-thompson// tag go directly to [[*user GlassAutomaton]]. Everything else (including tales, SCPs, GoIs, and everything without the //iris-thompson// tag) go to [[*user Professor Puffer]]. The exception to this being any co-authored works (in which ownership will default to the other author) or any works where I specify otherwise.&#34;
