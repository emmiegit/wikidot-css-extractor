[[include component:image-block | name=	http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/drdapper-author-page-sandbox/scpauthorpageart2.png | caption=SCP-████ playing on his phone during lunch at Site-17 | width=300]]

**Item #:** SCP-████

**Object Class:** Safe? Keter? Safe.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-████ is to remain at Site-17 with Class-IV privileges. For the sake of containment, he is not to be severely reprimanded in any way regardless of uncooperativeness. While minor reprimands are fine, such as putting a timer on his --Xbox-- --Playstation-- --Xbox-- computer, major reprimands that will urge SCP-████ to leave Foundation custody are to be avoided.

Due to the nature of SCP-████, absolute containment is not possible. SCP-████ has expressed a desire to &#34;live&#34; at Site-17 permanently, but in the event SCP-████ leaves Site-17, he is to be lured back with promises of the following:

* Steam gift cards
* --A gallon of whole milk--[[footnote]] No longer applicable after SCP-███ was put on a dairy-free diet [[/footnote]]
* Internet that doesn&#39;t shit the bed every 20 minutes
* An offer to join Alpha-9 on a mission[[footnote]] SCP-████&#39;s Alpha-9 application has been denied 32 times. However, allowing SCP-████ to tag along purely as an observer //should// be fine [[/footnote]]
* A trip to Freddy Fazbear&#39;s Pizza
* Free art commissions
* FGO rolls
* --A date with █████--[[footnote]] Impossible following the collapse of the gateway to Universe-61/205 [[/footnote]]

**Description:** SCP-████ is a 4ft flat humanoid entity. He has a blocky body structure, and his skin is a red pigment. Many have pointed out similarities between him and the main character from the video game &#34;████ ████&#34;.

Aside from its appearance, SCP-████&#39;s anomalous properties comes from that fact that he can essentially will anything he wants into happening. The difference between SCP-████ and, say, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-239 SCP-239], is that SCP-████ seems to be completely unaware of his powers. As such, he perceives anything he causes as merely a convenient coincidence.

For example, SCP-████ unlocking all doors and deactivating all security measures when he feels like leaving the site. He is unaware that these security failures were caused by him, instead believing that said security measures simply did not exist.

There are limits to his abilities, however. Notably, the ability to teleport, travel dimensions, avoid death[[footnote]] SCP-████ has died before, usually in ridiculous and humorous ways. However, he always just reappears in his bedroom shortly after dying, claiming to not remember the death [[/footnote]], not get sick when the weather first gets cold in September/October, consume dairy, micro in HoI4, or find love.

**Addendum-████-1:**  On May 24th, 2021, SCP-████ was spotted writing in a notebook labeled &#34;Works By [[*user DrDapper]].&#34; When asked, SCP-████ claimed it was &#34;where he kept all his stories.&#34; Attempts were made to confiscate the notebook, but was prevented thanks to SCP-████&#39;s anomalous properties. He did, however, offer to share the contents of the notebook with the Foundation, stating that &#34;getting people to see Tales is impossible. Anything to help increase traffic.&#34;

Below are hyperlinks to everything found within &#34;Works By [[*user DrDapper]].&#34;

[[tab Contact]]
+ ##white|Contact##

------

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
&#34;There are many ways to get into contact with me. The easiest and most convenient will be through Wikidot PMs. My DMs are also always open on [https://twitter.com/DrDapperTF2 Twitter], [https://discord.com/channels/@me/472222098090098688 Discord], and (if you&#39;re really desperate) [https://steamcommunity.com/id/drdappertf2/ Steam].

I usually respond within 12 hours of contact, though it may take longer depending on how life is going. Unfortunately, more personal info such as my phone number and personal email aren&#39;t know by anyone on the Wiki (including wiki friends). If I don&#39;t respond to any of what&#39;s listed above, then consider me unreachable.&#34;

(PS: If you do contact me, PLEASE don’t just send me a DM message saying “hey” or “can I talk you to.” Let me know you’re reaching me from the Wiki, other wise I’m just going to assume you’re a scammer and block you.)

Everything else (including tales, SCPs, GoIs, and everything without the //iris-thompson// tag) go to [[*user Professor Puffer]].
