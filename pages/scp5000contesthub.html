[[size 300%]]**SCP-5000 Contest: Mystery!**[[/size]]

++* At its core, the SCP Wiki has been an attempt to expand upon, and perhaps solve, the mysteries and riddles posed by SCP-173 on /x/ more than a decade ago. What is the Foundation? What are SCP objects, and where do they come from? What in the world is an &#39;HMCL supervisor&#39;? As the fiction has expanded, the mysteries have only gotten more and more complex. Now, for SCP-5000, you shall be posing more. Perhaps you&#39;ll solve them as well. That&#39;s up to you.

++* Congratulations to Tanhony for taking the SCP-5000 slot, and a sincere thank you to all participants! Seeing the work that you have produced for this contest has been an absolute delight, and both I and the wiki thank you all.

+++* Special Thanks

Contest Marshal TSATPWTCOTTTADC and Contest Assistant Edna Granbo went above and beyond to aid in running this contest, often carrying the brunt of the work on their own backs. This contest simply would not have been possible without their invaluable assistance.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-radd-zone Raddagher] made the lovely banner for our contest, on exceptionally short notice, which was and continues to be very much appreciated.
