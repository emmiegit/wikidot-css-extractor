**,,Sit up straight,,**

&#34;Why?&#34;

**,,The guy sitting next to you looks at you when you push your chest out.,,**

&#34;That&#39;s gross, I don&#39;t want him to look at me like that.&#34;

**,,Obviously, you do, or else you wouldn&#39;t have done it the first two times.,,**

&#34;That wasn&#39;t intentional!&#34;

**Please. You&#39;re a sniveling whore, and not even a good one at that.**

&#34;I&#39;m not! I just-&#34;

**But you //are,// aren&#39;t you? you&#39;ll pretend to turn your nose up at these men, but we both know that isn&#39;t what you really want. I can hear it you know? Every sick, depraved thought that runs through that head of yours.**

&#34;Stop.&#34;

++++ Oh? gonna start acting like you have some self-respect now?

&#34;I do-&#34;

++++ You don&#39;t. You never did. All you&#39;ve ever wanted is to be wanted. The thing about you, is that you fool yourself into believing that you&#39;re interesting enough for anyone to ever love you for the kind of person you are. It&#39;s pathetic.

&#34;Please just stop, it&#39;s enough-&#34;

++++ No, I don&#39;t think it is. You&#39;re a whore. for attention, for money, for all of those little things you can&#39;t admit mommy and daddy didn&#39;t give you enough as when you were a kid

,,&#34;...&#34;,,

+ ##990000| You deny me. You deny the most base urges that you know to be true in your soul, all for the sake of preserving what&#39;s left of your pathetic, broken pride. You are nothing in the face of your subconscious mind. No matter how you crave to be the powerful, respectable women of old, you&#39;ll always be a greasy stain upon their reputation. A disgrace to all who fought for you.##

,,&#34;I... am...&#34;,,

+ ##990000| Absolutely nothing worth dwelling on. The same slut you always were. The one you&#39;ll always be.##

,,&#34;You&#39;re right. I&#39;m sorry.&#34;,,</textarea></pre>
