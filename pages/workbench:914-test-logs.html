&gt; This page will be purged regularly. If your log is rejected or doesn&#39;t adhere to the correct format, make sure to save a copy yourself if you want to try again.

++++ How to write a 914 test log:

Guidelines for future entries can be found [[[scp-914-experiment-log-guidelines|here]]]. The FAQ is located at the bottom of [[[experiment-log-914-hub|this page]]].

All test logs should be written in the following form. Please include your researcher&#39;s name on all records, along with the date formatted in European standard and a list of the total number of items &#34;refined.&#34;

&gt; @@**Name:**@@
&gt; @@**Date:** DD/MM/YYYY@@
&gt; @@**Total Items:**@@
&gt; @@@@
&gt; @@**Input:**@@
&gt; @@**Setting:**@@
&gt; @@**Output:**@@

If you want to add a note to a log that has already been ported over, copy the number of the test log and the output/note before it into the following template:

&gt; @@**Suggested note for Test-XXXX**@@
&gt; @@[Section before suggested note]@@
&gt; @@[Your note]@@

----

++++ How this sandbox works:

* [[*user Leveritas]] (me) will regularly check this page, selecting logs that are of sufficient quality to add to the log and port them over.
* Tests that fail to adhere to the proper format (date, etc.) will **not** be ported until fixed.
* Ownership of content posted to the 914 log is retained by log curators as stewards over any content therein. As such, any authors contributing to the logs cede any future claims to said content to the collaboration log curator.

----

++++ Regarding 914&#39;s rules and guidelines:

SCP-914 does not create or destroy matter, nor does it change anything on the atomic level. All outputs should contain all and only the matter included in the input. Some grandfathered entries break this rule, but new entries should never do so. We call this Conservation of Mass.

Do note that in case you intent to break a [[[scp-914-experiment-log-guidelines|guideline]]] other than CoM, your test has to make up for it in quality.

----

++++ Regarding in-universe names:

It is generally seen as bad form to use other writers&#39; characters without asking. Of course, the rules of the wiki do not prohibit this, but asking beforehand will never hurt anyone.

+++++ If you&#39;re not comfortable with your in-universe name being used, politely request a change or come to me about it.

----

++++ Regarding professionalism in the logs

Some of you might have noticed that I&#39;m being harsher on notes and logs that I deem too LOLFoundation. To illustrate my point, I&#39;m going to use an example from Part IV:

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Half-Life 3?&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

**Name:** Jr. Researcher Redmar
**Date:** 20/03/2019
**Total Items:** One CD containing “Half Life” for PC

**Input:** Mentioned above
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An extremely bright light consisting of [REDACTED] Lumens, which faded after 15 seconds, revealing a CD with the cover art resembling that of Half Life 2, but the 2 was replaced with 3. When inserted into a disk drive, an image with the word: “NOPE” appeared on screen, followed by a noise resembling human laughter.

//Note: Jr. Researcher Redmar has requested reassignment. Granted. - Dr. Veritas//

[[/collapsible]]

I actually edited the note. This is what it originally was:

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Half Life 3? Original&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

**Name:** Jr. Researcher Redmar
**Date:** 20/03/2019
**Total Items:** One CD containing “Half Life 2” for PC

**Input:** Mentioned above
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An extremely bright light consisting of [REDACTED] Lumens, which faded after 15 seconds, revealing a CD with the cover art resembling that of Half Life 2, but the 2 was replaced with 3. When inserted into a disk drive, an image with the word: “NOPE” appeared on screen, followed by a noise resembling human laughter.

//Note: Fuck you, 914 - Jr. Researcher Redmar//

[[/collapsible]]

This is a very small difference, but it makes a world of difference in tone. The first entry works a lot better because it&#39;s not a researcher scolding the machine outright as a kid would. It&#39;s **implying** (read, show don&#39;t tell) that the researcher became so fed up with the result that he outright left. Wacky entries work well if it&#39;s against the cold professionalism that signifies the Foundation, and it **doesn&#39;t work** if it looks like the employees are acting just as unprofessional. Notes that enforce such excessive or LOLFoundation behaviour will be removed.

----

++++ Other things:

* No more introduction notes. 914 is supposed to be unpredictable, and there’s only so many times it can turn handwriting into different handwriting or a drawing before you start predicting it.
* Don&#39;t link outside of SCP wiki pages (crosslinks to other SCPs/Tales/GoI formats are ok). The reason for this are in-universe and out-of universe for different reasons:
 * In-universe, it&#39;s not professional conduct to link to anything outside Foundation intranet if that&#39;s not part of your job. On top of that, anyone can edit something like Wikipedia, and the Foundation would not rely on it as an reliable information source.
 * Out-of-universe, it&#39;s immersion breaking. Please write a short description of the concept instead. This way, it doesn&#39;t require the reader to read a Wikipedia article where a short description would have done the job.
