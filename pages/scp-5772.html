**Item #:** SCP-5772

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** All Type 1 information-generating anomalies[[footnote]]Anomalous information-generation entities with no limit on the nature of the information generated.[[/footnote]] are to be investigated and suppressed.

Research into the Navier-Stokes equation[[footnote]]The Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of viscous fluids, in a generic fashion.[[/footnote]] and related partial differential equations is to be monitored and dissuaded. Regular assessments of the risk of non-anomalous mathematical derivation of SCP-5772 are to be conducted. Such derivation is currently considered unlikely in the short-term.

All explosions of at least 25kt TNT-equivalent (10^^14^^ J) which are not associated with known nuclear-capable organizations are to be investigated for signs of SCP-5772 involvement.

Research is to be conducted into long-range detection of SCP-5772 instances.

**Description:** SCP-5772 is an efficiently implementable counterexample to the Navier-Stokes conjecture.[[footnote]]The Navier-Stokes conjecture claims that from any starting conditions, a fluid system that moves according to the Navier-Stokes equations will remain &#34;smooth&#34;. The smoothness condition roughly claims that the fluid&#39;s velocity, pressure and energy density will remain below some upper bound based on the initial state of the system.[[/footnote]]

When physically implemented, an SCP-5772 instance takes the form of an interacting system of vortices. As time progresses, the vortices will undergo feedback loops which concentrate the energy of the system into a smaller and smaller region near the center. As long as the system continues to evolve according to the Navier-Stokes equations for ideal viscous fluids, energy is concentrated arbitrarily densely, violating the Navier-Stokes smoothness conjecture.

Due to the non-ideal nature of the fluid, the evolution of the system eventually ceases to follow the Navier-Stokes equations, when the characteristic vortex width reaches the atomic scale. At this point, the high concentration of energy leads to the breakdown of the fluid&#39;s constituent particles, the brief formation of a Planck-scale black hole, and the liberation of over 1% of the rest mass of the fluid.

Mass-to-energy conversion ratio is significantly higher than the 0.024% conversion ratio of the B41 nuclear bomb, the maximum yield-to-weight ratio previously demonstrated.

Tests indicate that the system of vortices could be easily implemented in a fluid system of up to 2500 m^3,[[footnote]]For instance, a large swimming pool.[[/footnote]] allowing the straightforward production of explosives on the teraton scale (10^^21^^ J), on par with the most recent eruption of the Yellowstone supervolcano. Research into the feasibility of the creation of larger SCP-5772 instances is ongoing.

**Addendum:** SCP-5772 became known to the Foundation when it was described by SCP-10001. SCP-10001&#39;s primary anomalous property is its ability and compulsion to correctly answer any factual question posed to it.

During testing on 27 April 2020, SCP-10001 was asked &#34;What&#39;s the most dangerous thing I could do without standing up?&#34;. SCP-10001 then described a specific method for stirring a cup of tea.
