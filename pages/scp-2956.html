**Item#:** SCP-2956

**Object Class:** --Keter-- Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** As of the completion of Operation //Dostoevsky&#39;s Phalanx// on ██/██/██, SCP-2956 and SCP-2956-2 are considered neutralized. All containment efforts are to be concentrated in the Java Trench to monitor the remains of SCP-2956, and to impede all civilian attempts at surveying the seabed within 20km of SCP-2956. SCP-2956-1 is still considered an active anomalous entity, as analysis has shown heat signatures at multiple points along the body of the submarine, along with radio transmission originating from within the vessel itself. No attempt to communicate with SCP-2956-1 is to be made by Foundation vessels.

The 2956 designation will be eligible for reclassification as neutralized in 56,000 (±200) years - estimated time at which SCP-2956&#39;s structure will collapse completely due to benthic marine detritivores and natural marine weathering processes found in abyssal zones of the Indian Ocean.

Research is to continue regarding the identity of the GRU personnel from Tehran, and all other links to SCP-2956&#39;s construction and history. Research into the location of the anomalous Lenin bust and the three missing personnel is to continue with a priority 4 ranking. 

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ OUTDATED PROCEDURES&#34; hide=&#34;- HIDE&#34;]]
SCP-2956 is to be constantly monitored via attached GPS devices on the top of its hull, which are to be replaced every time SCP-2956 &#34;sheds&#34; its outer hull layer. SCPF //Turgenev// and SCPF //Faithfull// are to be tasked with maintaining a constant 12km exclusion zone around SCP-2956, with MTF Gamma-6 (&#34;Deep Feeders&#34;) tasked with boarding any civilian vessels that approach the zone. If SCP-2956 makes any movement which is seen as atypical for SCP-2956, it is to be shot at by any anti-submarine weapons available, in an attempt to force it to dive. Any Foundation vessels nearby SCP-2956 must deploy a constant channel marker on the frequency which SCP-2956-1 broadcasts.

In the event that SCP-2956 becomes undetectable, Station Lockton-12 &#34;2956-Ganymede&#34; is to be activated on Little Diomede Island in the Bering Strait, and must be actively maintained at this point in an effort to detect SCP-2956 during its annual crossing of the Bering Strait. At the point of a positive detection, the primary containment procedures are to be reinstalled, with Lockton-12 being deactivated.     

SCP-2956-2 is to be contained in a Standard Humanoid Containment cell (SHC) at Site-77. SCP-2956-2 must get no more than 4 hours of sleep at a time, and must be actively engaged in any activity available. This includes television shows and films from the staff depository at Site-77, played constantly on a closed television set in its cell. SCP-2956-2 is also to be given a set of puzzles to complete at least fourteen (14) times a day, along with a numerous short questions sourced from worldwide IQ tests. SCP-2956-2 is to be told that completing puzzles will grant him more hours of sleep. SCP-2956-2 is to be regarded as a Priority 1 individual, and must have immediate access to the onsite clinic in the case of a medical emergency, as well as having a regular medical and psychological evaluation bi-weekly.

Whenever SCP-2956-2 is in REM sleep, SCP-2956 is to be closely monitored, and forced to dive whenever possible. This is due to the heightened state of activity which SCP-2956 has shown during times when SCP-2956-2 is unconscious. 

In the case of an unexpected expiration of SCP-2956-2, the following is to be conducted, which is hereby referred to as an Omega Scenario:
* SCPF //Faithfull// and //Turgenev// are to use any anti-submarine weaponry available to force SCP-2956 to dive.
* All Foundation vessels are to deploy depth charges of varying magnitudes to force SCP-2956 to dive, and to keep SCP-2956 below its maximum launching depth.
* MTF Iota-8 is to board SCP-2956 if possible and force an entry. In the event of SCP-2956-2&#39;s death, the neutralization of SCP-2956 is authorized by O5 Command directly, as per Order 2956-//Oceanic Supremacy//

**Description:** SCP-2956 is a Project 941 &#34;Akula&#34; class Soviet submarine currently traversing the world&#39;s oceans in a semi-random pattern. As of ██/██/██, all attempts to intercept SCP-2956, ranging from using antisubmarine torpedoes and depth charges, to manually boarding the submarine during its rare surfacing events, have been met with failure. SCP-2956 is able to dive to depths far beyond the tolerance of most Project 941 submarines that were in service, and is able to dive at an exceptionally fast rate, allowing it to evade all attempts to contain it.

SCP-2956 spends most of its time circumnavigating the world at an average depth of 1200 - 1500m below the surface, in a number of different routes which normally take it once through the Bering Strait. SCP-2956 has also regularly been observed to rise to the surface and follow nearby civilian ships, before diving once again. Due to SCP-2956 being a Project 941 submarine, it is believed to have an arsenal of torpedoes at its disposal. Despite this, SCP-2956 has made no attempt to attack civilian or Foundation vessels, and each surfacing event is believed to be SCP-2956 investigating the intent of nearby vessels. Because of this, SCP-2956 is not considered a directly hostile entity to civilian ships. SCP-2956 also spends up to 3 - 4 months in &#34;hibernation&#34;, most often staying at the bottom of deep sea trenches, most frequently the Java Trench or Marianas Trench. During these times, SCP-2956-2 reports a significant reduction in hallucinations and images originating from SCP-2956. The mechanisms SCP-2956 uses to maintain structural integrity are currently unknown, along with its apparent regenerative abilities.

SCP-2956 is also able to &#34;shed&#34; its hull, replacing it with a new hull via currently unknown means. This allows SCP-2956 to maintain full structural integrity and repair any damages done by Foundation anti-submarine weaponry. As of ██/██/██, there are twelve (12) hull coverings left on the seabed, mostly concentrated in SCP-2956&#39;s &#34;hibernation&#34; spots, such as the Kuril-Kamchathka Trench and Marianas Trench. Apart from the physical anomalies, SCP-2956 has also been observed to broadcast a series of pseudorandom repeating tones and Soviet marching songs on a transponder system located within the vessel[[footnote]] Audio analysis has determined that the transponder system is using a microphone, and that all the noises heard in the broadcasts are originating from the main compartments of the vessel. [[/footnote]]. SCP-2956-1 has made efforts to communicate via this method, but these have been rare events. The speech is difficult to decipher, and the voice itself may not originate from a human larynx, but instead from somewhere within the submarine itself.

SCP-2956 is not autonomous, and is instead controlled by an entity hereby referred to as SCP-2956-1. --It is currently unknown how SCP-2956-1 controls the submarine, whether SCP-2956-1 is incorporeal in nature, or is the submarine itself. Due to this ambiguity, SCP-2956-1 will henceforth be regarded as an entirely separate entity to SCP-2956-- (See Operation DP report). SCP-2956-1 claims to be Ivan █████, a Soviet military officer who had died in a fuel explosion in Almaty, Kazakhstan sometime in the 1980s. According to Soviet documents, Ivan died of his injuries, with his body interred at a GRU site in Murmansk.

SCP-2956-2 is a 48 year old Caucasian male, with a height of 1.78m. SCP-2956-2 is Peter ██████, an American citizen who had gained citizenship after defecting from the Russian Government during the fall of the USSR in 1991. SCP-2956-2 appeared to show knowledge of the Foundation&#39;s existence before his containment, which has led intelligence officials to believe that SCP-2956-2 may have been a part of GRU Division &#34;P&#34;. However, when questioned, SCP-2956-2 affirms that he was not part of the branch and only knew them by name, and simply knew of the Foundation due to his time in the Russian Government. SCP-2956-2 was first discovered after actively seeking out Site-██ in [LOCATION REDACTED].

Hippo-Cortex Neurological Analysis has shown that SCP-2956-2 exhibits a Class IV telepathic connection between him and SCP-2956-1, who he claims is his biological brother, Ivan ██████. SCP-2956-2 describes being able to communicate with SCP-2956-1, as well as receiving a series of hallucinations and mental images from SCP-2956-1 of varying degrees of lucidity. SCP-2956 appears to be more active when SCP-2956-2 is in REM sleep or unconscious, for example appearing at the surface more often and following Foundation and civilian vessels closely. To date, there has been only one incident of SCP-2956 firing an SLBM[[footnote]] Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles, specifically RSM-52 150kt nuclear warheads carried aboard Akula class submarines. [[/footnote]], during which SCP-2956-2 had undergone cardiac arrest (see Incident-2956 report). This supports the hypothesis that SCP-2956 is kept in a docile state (Code: Non-Nuclear) via a constant telepathic connection to SCP-2956-2. 

It is currently unknown how SCP-2956-1 came to control SCP-2956, or how SCP-2956 was originally created, as no GRU documents exist pertaining to a date when SCP-2956 was first created. SCP-2956-2 accounts of the process in which SCP-2956-1 was created in its current form, or how he was involved with the process, is vague and scattered, with possible false memories being present. 

**Discovery Log:** SCP-2956 first came to the Foundation&#39;s attention in 1987, after a series of unusual events took place in Severodvinsk Port on the White Sea. Foundation satellites detected a mass, of unknown material, steadily growing in the port&#39;s dry docks. After six (6) days, the mass formed into a fully functioning Akula class submarine, before leaving the port entirely. Foundation vessels based in Svalbard were alerted and attempted to intercept SCP-2956. This attempt failed, however, as SCP-2956 had dived at an unknown point, and wasn&#39;t sighted again until 1995.

In 1995, the vessel was observed off the coast of Madagascar after all other Akula class submarines had been either decommissioned or accounted for. Foundation operatives were able to attach a GPS device to the top of its hull. Three months later, the current containment procedures were adopted, and preparations were made to attempt a containment of the anomaly.

&gt; **Interviewee:** SCP-2956-2
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr Froon, Site-77
&gt; **Date:** [DATE REDACTED]
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;START LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Hello, SCP-2956-2. I&#39;m Dr Karen Froon. I&#39;ll be your interviewer over the course of your stay here.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Please, call me Peter.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Of course. So, I just wanted to ask some basic questions. You&#39;ve spoken to our other Doctor, so you know what&#39;s going on?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Yes, I guess I do. I&#39;m to do these puzzles to keep my mind off of Ivan.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** SCP-2956-1? What can you tell us about him?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Well, I guess I&#39;ll start off by saying he was my younger brother. We only had each other to begin with, our mother was always out, busy. His life took a somewhat different turn. He rose up in the military after I had enlisted him, because he was too shy to do it himself. He really made our mother proud, and every other comrade, really. I didn&#39;t hear much from him until the event.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** And what can you tell us about this event?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Okay, sure. He died, to put it simply, died in a fuel explosion, somewhere. They showed us his body, burnt and unrecognizable. They took it away, cut it up, repurposed parts of his body in a lab somewhere. Then they took his consciousness, removed it from his brain and placed it inside a computer. He told me about how his world was 2D, completely incomprehensible to the mind. He was... noticeably different, after that. It was quite obvious how removing his mind from his body had messed with him. //(pause)// Don&#39;t be surprised if I seem unfazed by all this, I&#39;ve had years to allow it to toil away in my head.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** So they had trapped his consciousness inside of a computer? And then what?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** I don&#39;t know, I guess they put it into the submarine? Like I said to your other doctor, I have no idea what went on with that thing. They put me through some treatment, which is how I was able to communicate with him. I was unconscious for most of it, so I don&#39;t really know what happened. They just released me after a couple of weeks and I got back to my government job, and I&#39;ve been able to communicate with him ever since. The doctors told me that they needed a //familiar genetic partner// to allow the procedure to work. Seeing as I was his only remaining family member, they took me from my home and recruited me for the job.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** What does he say, if anything? Do you communicate often?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** I very rarely communicate with him, something I still feel quite guilty about, but I can&#39;t. If I do, it&#39;ll open the floodgates, and he won&#39;t stop. He&#39;ll send me hallucinations, images, everything. It was hard to concentrate ever since I defected, because he&#39;s always been there. At first he begged me to give him full control, then his pleading stopped and he moved on to sending me hallucinations and mental images. He tells me, often, that he&#39;s in pain, and it hurts. I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s telling the truth or just trying to make me feel sympathetic.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Can you elaborate on what he&#39;s been telling you? He said that he was in pain?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** He //is// the submarine after all. I don&#39;t know what they did to him, nor do I want to know. He thinks that, somehow, if he completes his mission, they&#39;ll be able to turn him back. I&#39;ve told him, many times, that the GRU aren&#39;t as big as they once were, that they don&#39;t care about him, but he sees it as his only hope.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** And his mission, I assume, is to launch nuclear missiles? We&#39;ve done analysis on the vessel, and have found evidence of warheads. When the USSR fell, he was to be used, correct?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Exactly, and I&#39;m the contingency. I act as a mental firewall, stopping him from launching nukes and attacking vessels. My job was to give him control when the time was right, all the way up to //glasnost//, although they were banking on me //not// defecting in &#39;91. I know that if I gave him the keys, he&#39;d do it. No doubt. He sees it as his only option, really.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** And that&#39;s why he&#39;s been sending you hallucinations?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** To get me to relent. He wants me to give up and give him the keys, but I haven&#39;t done it yet. Before I arrived here, Ivan was //really// going for it. I worked data entry jobs in the day, then came home and did word puzzles, all day, just to keep him at bay. I nearly slipped up a couple of time, nearly gave him the keys. I remember one time I got fired from work, and I was so close to giving Ivan full control. I still would have loved to have seen my boss&#39;s face melt in nuclear fire. God damn.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** How did you find us, anyway? You found our secure facility and drove your way through the gate with the intent of being captured.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** I saw a document of known Foundation locations during my time in Russia. That one stuck out to me because it was near the location that was in that Schwarzenegger film.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** We&#39;ll do some follow up on that, I&#39;m sure. But lastly, I have one more question. Are there any leads, any documents, locations, anything to do with the GRU which may lead us to more information regarding your brother Ivan?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** None, I&#39;m afraid. Our mother is dead, our dacha demolished, every record cleanly scrubbed. They gave me a new identity, but I still called myself Peter in private. You should consider yourself lucky that you could find anything on Ivan. The GRU attempted to completely remove his memory from existence. All they wanted was a fully autonomous submarine that would follow their orders. Completely dehumanizing him is was their method of control.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Thank you for your time, Peter. There will be more interviews soon, but for now just complete as many puzzles as possible.
&gt;  
&gt; **&lt;END LOG&gt;**

&gt; **Interview Log 16**
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;START LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Peter, how are you feeling?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** I&#39;ve been better, I&#39;ll be honest.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** What&#39;s wrong?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Ivan&#39;s hitting me hard this time. I think I need less time to sleep.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** That&#39;s not possible. Doctors on site have agreed that you&#39;re already undergoing sleep deprivation. We&#39;re trying to keep you safe as well as keeping you locked up.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** I think Ivan is planning something. He keeps trying to grab the controls whilst I&#39;m asleep. I&#39;ve become quite adapted to waking up in time but it&#39;s starting to get mentally taxing. It&#39;s getting harder to concentrate. Why are you here?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** I wanted to see what SC- Ivan, had been sending you. Mentally, I mean.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Well, right now he&#39;s been repeating the same things, a mixture of Russian marching songs and quotes by Karl Marx.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Are those coming from him? Is he speaking directly into your ear?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** No. Somehow he&#39;s been able to directly send footage to me, although it&#39;s quite blurry. Yesterday he sent me a 3 hour documentary about the Russian revolution to me, on repeat. I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s got it aboard his sub or if he just has good memory.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Is that why you became unresponsive yesterday?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Yes, sensory overload. I think his new tactic is more attrition than anything else. He&#39;s trying to //(inaudible)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** You&#39;re sweating. Is Ivan sending you something?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s a very vivid hallucination. There&#39;s someone in the corner of the room, I //think// it&#39;s meant to be Ivan, when he was young. It&#39;s quite fuzzy around the edges. He&#39;s throwing a ball against the wall of the room. I think it&#39;s his favorite ball, when he was ten. When he does something like that, it gets hard to hate him. It reminds me of better times, Doctor.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-2956-2 throws a ball of paper towards the corner of the containment chamber, tracks an invisible object across the room.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** He just walked through the wall. Ivan did this yesterday whilst I was trying to sleep. Some faceless commissar appeared by the side of my bed and started lecturing me about communism and society and everything, then went on a tangent about the woods near our old house. I want you to understand how hard it is to concentrate on anything whilst a man is screaming in my face asking if I&#39;m &#34;hiding the Tsar under my floorboards&#34;. This room doesn&#39;t even //have// floorboards.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:**  Your sleep cycle is worsening. You&#39;re eating less. You&#39;re being increasingly unresponsive to guard&#39;s orders. How long can you last like this?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Right now, I&#39;m not sure. It&#39;s never been this bad. He seems to suspect that you&#39;re going to try and kill him. Your friends in the boats, I mean.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Whilst you were asleep, SCP-2956 attempted to ram one of our vessels. You appeared to have awoken at the same moment, quite suddenly.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** I know. I felt him overwhelm me, kind of, whilst I was asleep. I woke up when I felt myself slipping. Waging psychological warfare against Ivan to keep him off the controls is tiring. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve had to deal with for the past 25 or so years.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** That submarine is a danger, that&#39;s for sure, and you&#39;re currently the only thing keeping him at bay. Can you somehow speak with him and convince him to surface, or enter an inlet or somewhere where we can trap him?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Why? So you can contain him? You&#39;re no better than the others, are you? I&#39;ve always tried to ignore him, but I can&#39;t anymore. Ivan doesn&#39;t deserve to be treated like an object. He doesn&#39;t deserve to get locked up in a pen and tested on. You&#39;ll lie to him, just like the GRU lied to him about bringing him back and &#34;fixing&#34; him. //(pauses)// I&#39;m not able to anyway, he has severed my line of communication. I can&#39;t speak with him.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Right. Well, I think the researchers here are quite keen to find out how someone traps a ghost inside a submarine, or how to even trap a conscious mind from a deceased individual.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** If you&#39;re asking again, no. There is no evidence remaining regarding the technology used to reanimate his consciousness and trap it inside a computer. They were sent through █████[[footnote]] A spatial anomaly pathway either utilized by the GRU or the Soviet Government to instantaneously quantum tunnel matter passed through it to a point in space approximately ██AU from Earth. Evidence of the device only exists in documents compiled from GRU defectors. [[/footnote]] when the USSR fell.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** So you know nothing about the process involving the creation of SCP-2956-1 in its current state?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** No, and nor do I wish to. The entire process was kept a secret from me. I&#39;m even sure that Ivan didn&#39;t know what was going on. The few times I&#39;ve asked him, he hasn&#39;t really explained his situation in great detail. He&#39;s not the best conversationalist. //(pauses)// Can you make a promise for me, Doctor?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** What is it?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** When you do attempt to destroy the submarine, which I know you&#39;ll try, make sure you kill Ivan as well. Don&#39;t leave anything behind, completely destroy it and leave nothing behind. The last thing I want is for him to be //conscious// down there. Even if the first thing he tries to kill with a missile is me. He&#39;s my brother and, in a way, I want what&#39;s best for him.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-2956 places his head in his hands.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Wow. I can&#39;t believe I just said that. It reminds me of the time before Ivan died, when I actually appreciated him. You got siblings, Doctor?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** I have a younger brother.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** From one sibling to another, Doctor, could you do that for me? Make sure he doesn&#39;t feel much pain?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** I&#39;ll see what I can do, but for now, here&#39;s another puzzle. We&#39;ve ran out of new puzzles, so you&#39;ll have to make do for the time being. I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ve done this one before.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-2956-2 points towards the eastern wall.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** No point, looks like little Ivan&#39;s come back and started playing again. I don&#39;t want to think about him, not like a child. It makes me tear up. Can I have some more time in a reduction chamber? Just for a little while?

//Two days after the second recorded interview, SCP-2956-2 collapsed in his cell. The emergency response team on site was summoned to find SCP-2956-2 had undergone a sudden and dangerous seizure, leading to immediate heart failure.//

    ]]

//At the same moment, an RSM Bulava SLBM (disguised as a US ████████ missile for reasons that are currently unknown) was launched from SCP-2956 and broke the surface. The team on the SCPF Faithfull were taken by surprise, as the launch had happened 2 minutes before Site-77 had alerted them regarding SCP-2956&#39;s sudden cardiac arrest. The missile climbed into the sky, before orienting itself north-east, heading directly toward the French mainland. The missile altered its course by 3 degrees, changing its trajectory in an attempt to target the city of Paris.//

//Seven minutes into the missile&#39;s flight, SCP-2956-2 was revived, and after three minutes regained full consciousness. At this point, the missile&#39;s propulsion system failed, causing the missile to lose momentum and fall back to earth, impacting the Bay of Biscay four minutes later without detonation. Recovery efforts were unsuccessful, and all system acknowledgments by early warning systems in Western Europe were covered up by embedded agents.//

//The event has been catalogued as Incident 2956-09. Further measures have been put in place to allow for a secure constant connection between SCPF Faithfull and Site-77.//

&gt; **&lt;START LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** You gave us quite a scare there, you know. What happened?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Well, I&#39;m not quite sure. Ivan&#39;s been hitting harder. He keeps repeating the same mental messages and strange images.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Which are?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Some strange bearded man[[footnote]] After further analysis and interviews with a forensic artist, researchers were able to determine that the &#34;bearded man&#34; was Slavoj Žižek, a notable Hegelian-Marxist philosopher.  [[/footnote]] talking in a lecture. I can&#39;t hear him because his voice is all distant. Sometimes it&#39;s backwards. Then it cuts to the same man waving the hammer and sickle over the //Reichstag//, then to him in a field. The field scene is... strange.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Can you describe it?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Yeah, sure. It&#39;s just that he has never done something like this. Not this heavy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Just describe it the best you can.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Well, he&#39;s standing at the bottom of a big pile of wood. There&#39;s always six people, strung up on crosses. It changes each time. One time it was the //Romanovs//, another time it was some faceless businessmen. Then it was me. //Me//. I saw myself up there, crying and pissing myself. This repeats itself, every time. God, I can feel it in the back of my head. He keeps doing it. The image is coming back. Fuzzy fucking image is back.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Just try to keep calm. Is this what made you collapse?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** No no. This was different. It was on the television, t-the one in the cell. Doctor, listen-
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Yes, we noticed that you had destroyed it and thrown it into the corner before passing out. We didn&#39;t notice any deviations in the film being played. We only noticed you becoming increasingly more distressed.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Yeah, well the film changed for me. One minute I was watching a film then the next minute it was completely different. I don&#39;t know if it came from Ivan or my own head.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Just describe what you saw.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Okay. It was some grainy, VHS type footage, like the type filmed on an old handheld camera. It was me and Ivan, as children, playing in the garden when our mother calls out to us, telling us dinner is ready. I remember the scene exactly, when I was seven.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** And this footage, you remember it being shot? Was it done by a relative or-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** No no. It was only my mother, brother and me. We lived in our dacha in the middle of nowhere. The footage was shot from a distance, by someone else. From the //treeline//. Whoever did it, we didn&#39;t see them, or I don&#39;t remember seeing them. I don&#39;t even know if it happened, or if it&#39;s all just in my head. Fuck, I can&#39;t do this Doctor.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** No. You slipped up today. Ivan fired a missile and nearly killed thousands of people. We need to know what happened, so carry on.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Okay. //(breaths deeply)// So, the footage cuts to me and Ivan walking down the road, near our house, going to school. P-please Doctor, I can&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Peter, you&#39;ve been treated much better than the other things held at this facility. Don&#39;t let that change. Carry on.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Okay, okay. //(Breaths deeply)// The camera is following us, bobbing up and down as if someone is holding it. Ivan keeps looking back towards the camera, as if he was aware of this guy following us.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** How do you know it was a man?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** And then it cuts to our classroom. All the children are there. The man&#39;s filming us from the back of the classroom, in the corner. No one is paying any attention to the man, except for me and Ivan. The camera started shaking as if he was breathing heavily. Me and Ivan were sitting next to each other, doing school work, whatever. Me and Ivan keep looking at him, looking more and more worried. I don&#39;t remember this at all, by the way. This had to be in my mind. Then all the children, except me and Ivan, started chanting: &#34;Show me your conning tower, //something// propellers and big beautiful silos&#34;. Again and again. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Was that everything? Is that what-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** And then a submarine crashes through the wall. Big metal beast, plows through everyone, killing everyone. The teachers, all the children, me and Ivan, bloodied and dead on the floor. Then the camera pans up, and shows the man holding the camera. He&#39;s smiling, almost laughing. Has worms in his mouth for some reason, hundreds upon hundreds of wiggling worms falling out of his mouth. I could hear him laughing. It was a strange laugh, not a &#34;haha that&#39;s funny&#34; laugh, but a laugh of pure pleasure and ecstasy. Then I blacked out.
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr Froon writes down notes//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** I don&#39;t know what happened. It was otherworldly. The man just seemed wrong, in every way. The worms, the contours of his face. I had to get rid of him. Even after I broke that television, the image still stayed in my head. Then I imagined a room, with the worm-man phasing back and forth through the wall, moaning like each passage through the wall was giving him an orgasm.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** So you blacked out after seeing the man with the worms in his mouth. Did you feel any other sensations? Any communication from Ivan?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** I felt myself slip away, and felt him take the keys. Then I woke up.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Your heart stopped beating as well. You were considered medically dead. Ivan fired a missile almost //instantly//. What happened when you awoke?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** I grabbed the controls. I took the keys from Ivan and stopped him from controlling the missile. I knew exactly where it was going and what he was going to do next. The missile was a diversion, so that he could slip away and unleash hell on America, just to get his job done.
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr Froon writes down notes in silence for approximately 12 seconds.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Doctor, there&#39;s something else I need to tell you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** What&#39;s that?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** I didn&#39;t know whether it was important or not, or just a stupid thing sent from Ivan. I&#39;m beginning to understand that this might be important.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** What is it?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** I keep having this recurring dream, and it&#39;s not good. I //know// it&#39;s not from Ivan, it&#39;s from my own conscious. It&#39;s a jumble of images, flattened reality against some television-like static. It starts to take shape into an image I can see. The main thing I remember is this room, with a pedestal in the middle. There&#39;s pictures of submarines, dials, cogs, clockwork covering the walls. Some cars and other machinery as well. There&#39;s other people in the room, but I can&#39;t quite see their faces. The pedestal is, weird... like there should be something there but there isn&#39;t. I think I&#39;m starting to remember what they did to me when I was unconscious, when they operated on me. They put something inside of me. I don&#39;t know. Fuck, I&#39;m just rambling.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Okay. That&#39;s okay, we can get it written up. Do you need to spend some time inside a reduction chamber?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** And I remember something else, as well. Each person was standing under their painting. A man under a car, a man under a //building// with fire coming out of it. My brother was there, standing under a painting of a submarine. Fuck, it&#39;s coming back clearly. I was standing at the center. Right next to that pedestal and a crib. Why was there a crib there?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** This is probably just a psychotic episode taking place. We can-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** But do you know what was the worst about it? The crib was empty, when it shouldn&#39;t of been, just like the pedestal. That //fucking// pedestal. I think we can find this room, Doctor. It&#39;s not just in my head because I&#39;ve seen it. With my own eyes. They took me there!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Peter, I&#39;m going to be filing a medical report, based on what you&#39;re saying. We might be able to do something about Ivan, and stop this from happening.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** There was a gynecologist room right next to my operation theater, where they worked on me. Officials, politburo, everyone moving in and out, taking paperwork. documents with pictures of Ivan in them. Pictures of a submarine. The room seemed too important to be missed. Oh god. Oh god no Doctor-
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froom:** Peter, you&#39;re sweating. You&#39;re hunched over and look like you&#39;re about to vomit. If you take some medication, and spend some time in the reduction chamber, you might feel better. What do you think?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-2956-2 stares at the floor.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** Peter?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2956-2:** Doctor, are you pregnant?
&gt; 
&gt; //Note - Dr Froon was 2 months pregnant at the time of this interview, which was not apparent to an average observer.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Froon:** //(Glances towards the observation window)// Why would you think that, Peter?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-2956-2 remains unresponsive.//

&gt; **Re: SCP-2956-2**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We also have reason to believe that these hallucinations may not be entirely native to the consciousness of SCP-2956-2, but instead may be incorporeal in nature, possibly in the form of Class 8 projections or coming directly from SCP-2956-1. Today SCP-2956-2 reported seeing upwards of sixty (60) different humanoids inside the cuboid containment chamber, identified (by SCP-2956-2) as multiple members of the Red Army Choir, all of which were reported to have played a variety of songs for upwards of 5 hours. Guards on site reported hearing faint orchestral music emanating from the containment chamber, and a quick medical analysis concluded that SCP-2956-2 had experienced ear drum damage in both ears as well as multiple lacerations on the lower abdomen and abrasions to the neck. SCP-2956-2 claimed that the humanoids in the hallucination stopped mid song and began to attack him in a variety of ways including, but not limited to: stabbings with flutes, bludegonings with brass instruments and attempts to strangle SCP-2956-2 with violin strings, followed shortly by engaging [REDACTED] as a group. CCTV from the chamber showed SCP-2956-2 physically recoiling during the event, although no humanoids were witnessed on camera. 
&gt; 
&gt; Shortly afterwards, a series of Cyrillic written sentences, written in charcoal, manifested without warning on the eastern wall, reading the following:
&gt; 
&gt; IF YOUR //(sic)// LOCKED UP
&gt; AND I&#39;M A SUBMARINE
&gt; WE&#39;EL //(sic)// ALWAYS HAVE EACH OTHER
&gt; DON&#39;T TRUST THEM
&gt; I DIDN&#39;T MEAN TO HURT YOU
&gt; 
&gt; After this, SCP-2956-2 broke down crying, and has since failed to respond to all external stimuli, but is still conscious. We give him a couple of days, at most, before he collapses from exhaustion. I implore you to alert //Faithfull// and O5 command immediately.

After this point, SCP-2956 was considered a Level &#34;Red&#34; threat to humanity, and preparations were made to neutralize the anomaly as soon as possible, due to the presence of SLBMs aboard SCP-2956. After authorization from O5 Command, SCPF //Faithfull// and a group of other Foundation ships were sent to the last known location of SCP-2956. The plan involved making radio contact with SCP-2956-1, to give time for the crew of the //Faithfull// to destroy SCP-2956. A 100kt nuclear warhead was re purposed from Armed Area-██, along with a bathyscaphe (Previously //Bathyscaphe ██████//)

Dr Vasily, aboard the //Faithful//, attempted to make contact with SCP-2956-1 during its voyage from the Bering Strait. SCP-2956 headed directly south, before turning west at the ██th Parallel and heading past Papua New Guinea. A flotilla of Foundation vessels were assembled from the Andaman Islands in an attempt to corner SCP-2956 against the coastline of Australia. However, SCP-2956 slipped through, before descending rapidly down the Java Trench. The vessels then entered formation, with //Faithfull//, //Turgenev// and //Dominica// forming the forward echelon during the incursion.

On ██/██/██, SCP-2956 dived down towards the bottom of the Java Trench in what appeared to be an attempt at evasion from the Foundation flotilla above. During this time, SCPF //Faithfull// attempted to make contact with SCP-2956 via utilizing the same frequency as the radio signals being broadcast from SCP-2956. SCPF //Faithfull//, and a handful of other Foundation vessels were positioned at the surface at the eastern end of the Java Trench, exactly above the site of SCP-2956. At 14:50, successful contact was made, headed by Dr Emilia Vasily.

&gt; **14:50** At the point of first successful contact, the team aboard the //Faithfull// were given the go ahead, and the warhead was prepped and placed into the Bathyscaphe. Before this point, it was unknown whether the bathyscaphe could descend unmanned and be detonated remotely. Due to the unreliable positioning of SCP-2956 upon the bathyscaphe&#39;s descent, a D-Class was assigned to guide the vessel down to the bottom of the Java trench. All dialogue that follows has been translated from Russian.

&gt; **&lt;START LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr Vasily:** Ivan, can you hear me?
&gt; 
&gt; //After a moment of static, a voice comes into focus. Analysis reveals that the voice does not belong to SCP-2956-1, and is possibly originating from an overused recording device within range of the microphone aboard the submarine.[[footnote]] The voice may belong to Dr Stanislav Yurovsky, a GRU personnel who is believed to have defected to the Warsaw Sect in 1996. Whereabouts currently unknown. [[/footnote]]. A second voice is also heard. The mechanism by which SCP-2956-1 is able to use the recording device is unknown.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** ...Yes, you are aware that the parameters have been met, correct?
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** //(inaudible)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Okay, right, I get that. I know that Tsarnev believed that the vessel would displace upwards of 2.5km^^3^^ of water away from the White Sea. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** //(inaudible)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** No, to the Kremlin. Yes, they thought that the water would collapse over command. That&#39;s why preliminary analysis was fucked. Just write it off as anything.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** //(unknown, possibly &#34;goodbye&#34; or &#34;goodness&#34;)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Okay, I&#39;ll get to it. //(3 second pause)// Ivan, or LUR-09, as you are now known, I hope you can hear this. The technicians will put the recording inside the vessel and leave it with you, shouldn&#39;t be hard to find. So I just want to get some things out of the way. I assume you&#39;ve spoken to Dr Kyuvsky since we last spoke? That wasn&#39;t a question, I&#39;m quite sure that happened, but if not, I want to clear some things up with you. The process has been less than successful, I&#39;m sure you can see that. I just want to make sure you understand everything.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Firstly, I want you to know that you may experience quite a shock once you awake. You&#39;ve been inside a transistor for the past few months, and the psychologists said you would have lost all muscle memory or any memory of a physical body. Now, we were able to lay down a nervous system substitute inside the pipes and hull, so you should still be able to feel. You scratch the hull, you scratch yourself, if you will. If you want to know, your &#34;brain&#34; is located inside the cabinet of the control room, screwed into the floor. The brain is connected to the rest of the nervous system, which again connects to the periscope and propellers. Now, this may sound quite daunting, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get used to it in no time. Remember when we turned someone into a Lada? Yeah, he was fine, wasn&#39;t he?
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Ur, you should also be able to speak. We are not sure why that was in the design, but it was. If you ever need to identify yourself at a Russian port, you can do so. Remember, this is a black project, most of the GRU don&#39;t know about this, so things could get a little heated if you went back to base. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** //(inaudible)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** //(laughter)//. They never needed to install any of that stuff. Yes, Ivan, what&#39;s been substituted for your motor neurons that were once in your leg have been installed in the propeller system, so you can achieve locomotion by utilizing the same sensations as walking, so that should make things easier. And no, we haven&#39;t gone the same path as we did with the Ukrainian. Yes, the rumors were true, he could achieve orgasm by rubbing his fuselage. I think it was more of a sick joke on their part. We haven&#39;t made any erogenous locations along the submarine by lacing it with receptors. This is serious business, so you need to understand how to control yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** //(inaudible)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Okay, yeah. Tell command that we&#39;re almost ready. May have to do a sensory check on the aft tubes. Let me get back to the recording so Ivan doesn&#39;t miss anything.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Unidentified noise in recording, 3 seconds)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** So, being able to control yourself is very important. Like I said, your leg muscle motor neurons have been assigned to the propeller, but your lower body is where the //real// magic happens. We&#39;ve been able to preserve your heart, kidney and lower organs in a vat somewhere close to the reactor on the sub, inside of which is the majority of your groin area and upper thighs. There&#39;s a Barri-conductor tube inserted into the urethra, with the spinal column connected to the central nervous system spanning the entire sub, so you should be able to feel your lower body. Twisting your hips in different directions should allow you to control your depth. And the anti-freeze. Don&#39;t forget the anti-freeze. It should run down a tube in the severed esophagus and out of your right heel. There&#39;s no heating, remember.
&gt; 
&gt; //(13 second pause, paper shuffling heard in recording)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** We have your brother, Peter. He&#39;s safe and sound with us. He is very necessary to the project, because it doesn&#39;t take a doctor to understand that you are mentally unstable. You had been diagnosed before you had died, and I think the process of dying and conscious reanimation may have messed with you. You have the mental capacity of a twelve year old, alongside a rapidly degenerative mental condition. Personally, I would have picked a more stable candidate for the project, but as you know you were the only surviving consciousness contained on the computer, the others were corrupted. We tried to delete most of them, but the rest are stuck in some landfill somewhere, despite our best efforts at a digital //coup de grâce//. You were the only consciousness available, so you should be quite grateful. Now, things may get fuzzy later on due to obvious circumstances, so just play back this recording if you forget anything.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** Anyway, I&#39;ll keep sending you discreet messages on your little receiver there. Things may get heated later on, due to the command reformations and other such happenings. In the reactor room there should be a lamp. As long as it&#39;s on, you know everything is okay, understand? I hope you do because it is necessary for this to work. In the event that you don&#39;t follow orders, and initiate procedure VGU-Concrete Tundra prematurely, Peter will act as a contingency. You should be able to directly communicate with him, so he can keep you up to date with any changes. Peter is a good kid, he&#39;ll follow orders. If everything else fails on our end, he&#39;ll give you the keys. Primary target sites are located in a book which should be on the desk in the control room. There&#39;s a mechanism which can open the book and show you. We&#39;ll inform you of any changes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** The psychologists have done a lot of work to mentally prep all candidates in our project. You should be able to imagine a room, with all your friends, adorned with nice paintings and our eternal leader, sitting proudly at the center. Your brother will be there as well, at some point. You won&#39;t be alone throughout all this, Ivan, we&#39;ve been kind enough to allow you to have some semblance of company, even if it&#39;s only psychological. We are not monsters. You always wanted kids, right? That&#39;s what everyone wanted. Well, soon you&#39;ll be kept occupied by a lovely bundle of joy. But, we&#39;re still working on that. Obviously, no one is going to give up their own kid for the project.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Heavy machinery heard in recording, 12 seconds)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** //(shouting over noise)// And maybe, Ivan, if you do a good job, we may be able to bring you back, and-
&gt; 
&gt; //A whirring noise is heard, attributed to the recording device being reset//
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 1:** ...Yes, you are aware that the parameters have been met, correct?
&gt; 
&gt; **Voice 2:** //(inaudible)//
&gt; 
&gt; [REDACTED FOR BREVITY] The recording repeats itself four (4) more times, with many unsuccessful attempts by Dr Vasily to communicate with SCP-2956-1. Current theories suggest that SCP-2956-1 was able to access a recording device found in the control room where its consciousness is centered, and had been replaying it for some time. Audio specialists recorded hearing SCP-2956-1 begin to communicate in the form of vibrations from the hull which had been picked up by the microphone. The vibrations, which were able to effectively mimic human speech, were interpreted by linguists at Reliquary Site-██, who believe that SCP-2956-1 was attempting to shout or possibly cry, despite not having the physical capabilities to do so.
&gt; 
&gt; //Shortly after the 4th playback, the bathyscaphe contacted the sea floor, and the D-Class was ordered to detonate the explosive. The explosion totally destroyed the bathyscaphe, along with SCP-2956 approximately 109m away. The shock wave is believed to have ruptured the hull, leading to a rapid decompression and collapse of the structure. Sonar imaging showed SCP-2956 impact the sea floor before coming to rest. SCP-2956 deemed neutralized at this point.// 
&gt; 
&gt; //At the same moment SCP-2956 was destroyed, SCP-2956-2 expired.[[footnote]] Moments before his death, SCP-2956-2 was witnessed to have crossed himself before &#34;wishing Ivan goodbye&#34; and apologizing for &#34;getting them into this mess&#34;. [[/footnote]] CCTV cameras from the site captured a rapid expulsion of all internal organs via a sudden bisection of the thoracic cavity, caused by an unknown force. Approximately 17 seconds after SCP-2956-2 expired, a bust of Lenin of unknown material manifested in the corpse&#39;s place. The entity appeared for only 1 second, before vanishing along with 3 containment specialists who were within sight of the object. This was shortly followed by personnel within a 30m radius experiencing symptoms of retinal detachment, decompression sickness, nitrogen narcosis and [REDACTED]. Along with this event, Dr Karen Froon experienced pain in her lower abdomen, which led her to discover that her unborn child had suddenly dematerialized. Researchers also noted a strong smell of wet paint and gunpowder at the manifestation point, along with feelings of dizziness, nausea and the sounds of a &#34;sinking vessel&#34; and &#34;sonar pings&#34; emanating from the containment chamber.[[footnote]] The sounds were not picked up by any cameras on site, and was only heard by affected personnel. &#34;THANK YOU CONCUBINE&#34;, spoken in Russian, was also heard by multiple personnel on site during the event, seeming to emanate from the ground immediately around the containment chamber.  [[/footnote]]// 
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-2956 has now been lowered to Safe, as both SCP-2956 and SCP-2956-2 are considered neutralized. SCP-2956-1, however, is still considered active, due to faint radio transmissions originating from within the remains, which are currently too faint to be recorded. Bathyscaphes and other submersibles have also reported the inner hull of the vessel to vibrate upon approaching the remains, along with the periscope atop the structure moving by itself. However, due to the irreversible damage sustained during Operation DP, the vibrations are too weak to be recorded and deciphered. The Ethics Committee will hold a vote on ██/██/██, discussing whether further action should be taken against SCP-2956 to ensure its complete destruction as per Protocol-██████/██[[footnote]] Tansey, K., Frugel, P., Reddy, S., et al. (1989). //Sapience and Sentience - Ethical Guidelines and terms of Euthanasia// Ethics Research Archives, //c.89-91// AC (781648) [[/footnote]].//
&gt; 
&gt; //**Director Note:** Safe anomalies have been briefly moved off site during investigation into the events preceding the death of SCP-2956-2. Dr Tomlinson is currently taking over the Psychological Communication Department at my request to allow Dr Froon to move projects for some time, which has been granted by my advisors. All other personnel affected by the event have been granted medical leave, and should hopefully recover.//

------

The following is a handwritten note recovered from a deceased individual found inside an apartment in Tehran on [DATE REDACTED]. The man was found in the bathtub with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

The apartment was rigged with IEDs, and a speaker system left on playing an Arabic remix of &#34;Yellow Submarine&#34; by The Beatles. We don&#39;t know whether our John Doe set it up, or someone get their before us, due to signs of forced entry in the doorway. Whoever it was, they had a real sense of humor.

I&#39;m pinning this under the 2956 designation, but there&#39;s not much here. I hope this makes it&#39;s way to you. The lyrics at the end are written in Hebrew, with the rest of the note in Russian Cyrillic.

Get back to us on anything you find.

&gt; Forgive me, for I have sinned.
&gt; 
&gt; We went against god&#39;s will, and took a man from his natural shell. We removed charred bone, skin, flesh, everything - and mixed it with cold steel and depth gauges. Grew it up in a Petri dish, built it up to the real thing.  
&gt; 
&gt; We kept his soul, removed its chance of a place in heaven, and let a machine consume it. The machine churned up his mind, minced and reduced to the point of being completely unrecognizable and child-like.   
&gt; 
&gt; We should have stopped with the peat grinder, the lada, the tupolev, the hydroelectric dam, the helicopter, the oil refinery. We put broken men&#39;s minds inside of useless //(unintelligible)//. One man was an honest cancer patient. Once he had a wife, took his children to school, sung the anthem. Now he sits there, out on the steppe, letting water in and out to power a city full of drunken Kazakhs.
&gt; 
&gt; And you know what? Some days he&#39;ll let less water in, just to make a point. To piss someone off. Who? Some unknown entity, some ambiguous figure of authority which governs the Kremlin from the shadows. All he can do is stand and stomp his childish feet in that dingy room with Lenin and that fucking baby. Both him and Ivan, next to their little paintings.
&gt; 
&gt; Ivan&#39;s still alive, and it pains me. I&#39;m still getting his transmissions on my receiver. I know you soulless fucks will find my dead body, so I just want you to know that you failed. You //failed.// The mind of a child, trapped in a metal tomb, sitting at the bottom of the darkest hole on Earth - wanting nothing more than to see his brother and //feel// life. And the worst bit? He still thinks he needs to finish his job -  and end the world. 
&gt; 
&gt; //End the world.// He doesn&#39;t even know how a nuke works. How they remove cities, burn people alive, gut the atmosphere with radiation - leaving behind nothing but faded shadows against scorched concrete. He&#39;s just a //child//, doing what he&#39;s been told.
&gt; 
&gt; This is my goodbye to everyone, and my wish for forgiveness. Ivan&#39;s struggle touched me, and this is my statement against the shit show we call the GRU Division.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m sorry Anna, I&#39;m sorry Yuri, I&#39;m sorry David.
