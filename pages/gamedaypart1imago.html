Clem Walsh was having a bad day.

Months ago, he had lucked out on a cushy assignment watching a giant cocoon do nothing for hours on end, giving him plenty of time to read. His coworkers teased him about his choices: &#34;Why&#39;re you reading that crap fantasy shit when you&#39;re surrounded by so much weird shit?&#34; But he enjoyed escaping into a world where he //knew// there&#39;d be a happy ending. And hey! He had a pretty easy-going boss and he wasn&#39;t on the midnight shift like on his last assignment. So things were doing pretty good. Then the building shook and the klaxons went off.

Clem knew the drill: lockdown the containment chamber first, lockdown the observation room second, contact security and bossman third. One was easy, just a matter of hitting a button, but when he went to lock the observation room door, the damn lock wouldn&#39;t engage. He propped a chair under the handle as a stop-gap and went to the phone to call the boss when it rang under his hand.

Clem noticed a motion out of the corner of his eye and turned towards the large observation window.

&#34;Jesus fuck me!&#34;

Standing on the other side was a... //thing// that looked like the bastard child of an orgy involving a yellowjacket and an octopus, with a little extra ugly for good measure. It had one of its... appendages on the glass and he could swear the damn thing was looking at him despite the one-way mirror.

Clem scrambled to clear the chair from the door when the glass began to bubble and warp under the thing&#39;s tentacle-claw-leg-thingie. He had just pulled it free when the softened glass broke with a &#34;pop&#34; that he barely heard over the klaxon, and then shattered in its pane. He looked behind him and took a deep breath to scream... then smiled.
