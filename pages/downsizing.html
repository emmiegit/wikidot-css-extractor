##990000|In the dark beneath the frozen earth, there was a thing. It grasped with many hands, and screamed through many mouths, tunneling its way through rock and dirt and the ruins of ages long gone. The thing was divided, split amongst countless forms that shuddered and prowled separately ‚Äì humongous bodies that towered over the entombed houses of forgotten men, and smaller bodies that still found themselves drawn to inhabit those same houses as if recalling that they had once been human. They were all //it//, however: a single //thing//, a single mind with a unified purpose ‚Äì to search, to find.##

##990000|What exactly they ‚Äì it ‚Äì looked for, the thing did not know. The idea had come to it in a dream, although the thing did not understand what a dream was, for it had never dreamt before. All it had ever done was hibernate, keep itself safe from the wrath of the elements outside. In the black nothingness of slumber, nothing had ever disturbed it, until that night. The thing felt a spark light itself in the vastness of its flesh, a spark that grew into a burning want for something unknown. The thing had woken up and, for the first time, it //desired// something more than warmth and sustenance, something beyond the animalistic instincts that dictated its entire existence.## 

##990000|It remembered ‚Äì it realized that it remembered ‚Äì a time before its burial beneath the eternal freeze, a time when the thing was not as vast as it was now, a time when it was not //it// but a plurality. It remembered many lives, saw through many eyes, and with the memory of the old world came the realization that it had been cast out, expelled and cut off from all that was before.## 

##990000|The thing felt an alien thrum growing in its many throats, a heavy knot of unknown sensation that unraveled itself into a wailing, into a chorus of malformed voices that echoed through the tomb it had been sealed in. The thing wept. The thing seethed. The thing knew loneliness.##

&#34;It has been a great honor, Your Grace, to be your guest for these last few days,&#34; Francisco said, dropping to one knee. &#34;I hope these gifts are enough to show my gratitude for Your hospitality.&#34;

The wind&#39;s howling atop the hill nearly drowned Francisco&#39;s voice as he tried his best to respect protocol under the duress of the elements. Thunderclouds on the horizon and the threat of heavy snow were all the reasons he needed to get in his hovercraft and return to base ASAP.

The king did not immediately answer, still focused on perusing the pile of books and manuscripts before him. He and his retinue did not seem the least concerned with the increasingly hostile weather.

&#34;These new lands Her Majesty has ceded to us are most bountiful in both fruit and game, and Her upholding of our peace with the Kingdoms Beyond is commendable,&#34; he finally said. &#34;It is us who are grateful, Sir Francisco. That said, new books to expand the Royal Library are always welcome.&#34;
¬†
&#34;Then, if Your Grace grants His permission, I shall be on my way.&#34;

&#34;And will you make sure our request is delivered to Her most serene and glorious Holy Roman Empress?&#34;

&#34;I am but a humble servant, yours to command. I will do everything in my power, Your Grace, so that you and your people are granted audience with Empress Aelita. God willing, I shall return to you with her answer before the next harvest moon.&#34;

His Royal Highness, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1845 | Eugenio the Ninetieth]]], by the Grace of God, King of the Forest, Lord of the Plains, Duke of the Grand Fir and the Undergrowth, Count of the Swamp, Warden of All the Streams and Rivers, and Lord Protector of the Cities of Man, Defender of the Faith, held aloft his signet ring for the kneeling Francisco to kiss.

&#34;Very well. Go now, Sir Francisco of the Foundation. Do your duty to your Empire. May God be with you on your journey.&#34;

Francisco kissed the ring and stood, hoping the hovercraft&#39;s takeoff would not fluster the king and his assembled retainers. Few things would be as unknightly as scaring a crowned, jeweled fox and his fellow animals back into the depths of the forest. 

As the coordinates of his destination flickered on the nav-computer&#39;s screen, Francisco set the hovercraft on autopilot and sat down to gaze at the French countryside, barely visible through the windscreen as the vehicle sped through dense cloud clusters. He had registered his departure with mission control, and whomever expected him back at headquarters had not informed him of any further assignments. He already dreaded the boredom that came with intermissions.

There wouldn&#39;t be much to report to his superiors, regardless. Everything had gone just as it had for the last five times he had been at Containment Area 4, with the sole difference of the king&#39;s request for an audience with the Empire&#39;s supreme leader. Francisco had no doubt that it would be rejected as soon as it reached the ears of the Department for the Cooperation of Terran Species: they might no longer be the bane of the anomalous community, but their bureaucracy was still the stuff of nightmares.

A loud beeping alerted him to an incoming call on the ship&#39;s comms, the screen in front of him displaying the emblem of the DCTS: two hands ‚Äì one human, one inhuman ‚Äì holding each other over a map of the Earth, surrounded by two olive branches. Francisco pressed &#34;Accept call.&#34; He already knew who awaited on the other end.

&#34;So, how&#39;d it go?&#34; the words in heavily-accented English came a few seconds after the screen turned on, the image of a blond, green-eyed man replacing the Department&#39;s logo.

&#34;They&#39;re coming along well enough,&#34; Francisco replied in Imperial Common, his tongue tired after three days speaking French, a language he had never fully grown used to. &#34;Harvest will last them through the winter ‚Äì those tractors are sure coming in handy. They did request a meeting with the Empress, though.&#34;

&#34;Oof, I knew it was a bad idea to give them universal translators. How much paperwork do you think it will take to deny them that petition?&#34;

Francisco shook his head in disbelief.

&#34;Your bosses really need to tell them the truth, Michel. It isn&#39;t fair to keep them waiting on a visit from the Pope.&#34;

&#34;And risk cultural shock?&#34; Michel&#39;s laughter bounced around the hovercraft&#39;s interior. &#34;Here I was thinking your people were all about preserving normalcy.&#34; 

&#34;You think keeping an entire civilization ignorant about the outside world is normal?&#34;

&#34;This //is// normalcy to them, Francisco: a stable, simple world where we&#39;re still in the Middle Ages... give or take a few tractors and flying machines.&#34;

&#34;Entire generations have come and gone in complete isolation while we keep marching on. Doesn&#39;t the Department worry they&#39;ll start getting suspicious?&#34;

Michel rolled his eyes.

&#34;The people of the woods have known our agencies for almost two millennia now; if they were going to get suspicious, they would have done it a long time ago. Just listen to your Site Director: keep feeding them little lies, maintain protocol, and do not give up too much information about what goes on outside their woods. Stick to keeping the world at peace and the narrative coherent. Speaking of which, what books did you give them this time?&#34; 

&#34;Just a few more tomes of chivalric romances, some volumes on the history of Greece... shame the higher-ups didn&#39;t approve of my suggestions. I would have loved to get the king&#39;s opinion on //The Hobbit//.&#34; 

&#34;Well, you can always try again next year,&#34; Michel snorted. &#34;WAN willing, someone will take pity on you, //Sir// Francisco.&#34;

&#34;Shut up. I&#39;m not the one begging to get reassigned to field duty every time a minor scuffle between humans and fae occurs. Now that&#39;s pitiful! Though come to think about it, &#34;Michel Dumont, professional paper-pusher,&#34; is much easier on my tongue than &#34;Michel Dumont, DCTS field agent.&#34; You should put it on your resume.&#34;

&#34;Oh, Francisco, why must you hurt me so deeply?&#34; Michel cackled. &#34;See, that&#39;s how much things have changed: once we got to hunt giants and extraterrestrials, now we get to befriend them.&#34; 

&#34;If you can call what we do //befriending//, sure,&#34; Francisco said. &#34;I mean, me and my guys still get called Jailors from time to time; I figure you&#39;ve heard what they call you.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;ve heard, I&#39;ve heard...&#34; the corners of Michel&#39;s smile curved down for a moment. &#34;It&#39;s not as bad as when they called us [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goc-hub-page | Bookburners]]].&#34;

##990000|The thing beneath the frozen earth did not know for how long it had been buried: through its memories it understood the passing of the seasons, but the world outside its tomb was as unknowable as the reason for its banishment. No sun, no moon, no stars ‚Äì how could it ever know anything beyond its own solitude?##

##990000|Sometimes, the tiniest fragment of a former life would flare up and burn its way into the nodes of its mind. The memory would speak its truth, and the thing would try to find a place for it in the mosaic it had cobbled together. It recalled warm days working fields of wheat, sweat running down its back; the evening breeze caressed its face as it rested along a sea tinged gold by the setting sun; it felt a sudden panic and fled from glowing eyes that watched from beyond the trees. The thing remembered all of this, all these sights and sounds its bodies had experienced, yet it knew that none of them were its own. //It// was not the men and women and animals of all sizes whose passage through the world it witnessed in its mind&#39;s eye. //It// was not the people who shared their bread and fire with a weary traveler, or the mouths that laughed at a simple joke, nor the tender hug of two lovers who found each other under the stars. //It// was not.## 

##990000|What, then, was the thing? Did it have a name? How had it come to know all these memories ‚Äì all these names and faces ‚Äì yet lived none of them? Why had it been exiled, condemned to this sepulchre of ice and stone?## 

##990000|//Why?//##

##990000|The thing had no tongue, no words with which to ask questions. But it had hands ‚Äì hundreds of them. And one day of odd warmth, as the frost above it melted away, it dug its way into dawn.##

Francisco made his way through the upper levels of Foundation Site-153, absent-mindedly humming a tune that had stuck to his mind like a cognitohazard. With so little to do until his next assignment, and with most of his fellow agents still asleep, the base was his to use as he saw fit. Right now, it was a jogging track.

Site-153 was empty, so empty that, had a random civilian stumbled upon it, they would have probably taken it for a failed mall or an abandoned housing project. 

Francisco might have been under that impression too when he first arrived at the site, if not for the massive SCP Foundation logos that decorated every other concrete wall, a lingering memento of the organization&#39;s once unparalleled power. From the field reports he had read after being assigned there, Site-153 had once been the largest, most heavily guarded Foundation facilities on Western Europe, and the ominous three-arrowed logo a constant reminder of its mission&#39;s scope: Secure. Contain. Protect.

Of course, that had been a long time ago, a time when both the Foundation and the anomalous world it clashed with operated clandestinely, accountable only to themselves and to those mighty enough to force them into cooperation. That had been an age before the Sundering of the Veil, before the new normal‚Ä¶ before the Empire.¬†¬†

Now, with the Immortal Empire calling the shots, with mankind having embraced the anomalous world, these grey halls and concrete cells collected dust like they had once collected world-ending horrors, the Foundation&#39;s troops reduced to skeleton crews who jealously guarded what few SCP items still required containment. This was surely not the end that the Administrator would have hoped for the organization they had founded, but Francisco sure considered it a better fate than what had happened to some of the others. The Sundering had changed things forever, and every normalcy org around the globe had to either adapt or die. 

In a way, it was only natural, Francisco thought. The anomalous world wanted more than an apology ‚Äì it wanted justice, and the United Earth Federation could do little but concede to the demands of the millions of elves, dwarves, faeries, djinns, and others that the Foundation and its occult partners had wronged for nearly two centuries. The oppressed were now in positions of power ‚Äì the former freaks now ran the show. 

Yet the world had not ceased to be full of things that went bump in the night and, despite their hatred for the &#34;Jailors,&#34; even the most radical Serpent&#39;s Hand members had to agree that letting an immortal omnicidal [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-682 | lizard]]] loose was a terrible idea.¬†¬†Thus, the Foundation still had a purpose in this Unveiled world; the new normal was still //a// normal, and thus they still secured, still contained, still protected. The fight continued, yes, but on a much smaller scale.

Francisco ended his run back where he had started it: the upper levels which had once been used for testing low-risk anomalies. Glass windows lined the walls, the rooms behind them dark and vacant. No doctors or researchers remained on site to use these facilities, and the last D-Class personnel had long been decommissioned. All that remained were cabinets upon cabinets of experiment logs and recordings, testimonies of what wonders and nightmares had been wrought by men and women in white lab coats. 

As he gazed into the glass, deep into his reflection&#39;s brown eyes, Francisco wondered how he would have fared had he been born some centuries earlier. The old world of the Foundation in its prime was sometimes spoken of with awe and reverence, but he knew better than to lionize the past: people like himself were rarely tolerated under the Foundation&#39;s violent enforcement of the Veil, let alone allowed to join its ranks. Would he have been one of the lucky ones, locked up forever, kept away from anyone who ever knew his name? Or would have he become another anonymous victim cut open by scalpels, his insides prodded in search of what made him tick?

A ticking of gears was quick to answer the question, and he turned his eyes to his bare chest. 

Below Francisco&#39;s neck, a titanium carapace fashioned in the shape of a human torso protected a complex array of bronze machinery, clockwork and oil where organs and blood should be. The agent&#39;s arms and legs, once ordinary flesh and bone, were now cold, efficient metalwork, strong enough to crack granite with a single hit, durable enough to shrug off high-caliber bullets. He did not tire, did not breathe, and did not ache for food or drink. If he still jogged and slept, it was only out of habit, a way to stave off the boredom that plagued him between assignments. Humans were soft and vulnerable ‚Äì Francisco could take a plasma bolt to the sternum and keep fighting, unstoppable through conventional means. Only his face and features remained intact, vestiges of his former humanity. Beneath his skin visage, a fully organic brain remained safely hidden away within a reinforced cranium. 

In the past, Francisco&#39;s [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/church-of-the-broken-god-hub | beliefs and modifications]]] would have made him a target for the Foundation: they would not have seen him as a person or even an asset, but as a member of an anomalous cult to be hunted down and stopped before he could help rebuild his goddess. In this day and age, however, his anomalies were his edge as an agent, his skills invaluable for the interests of his employer and Empire. Francisco was the new normal, the new face of prosperity and peace.

Yes, Francisco thought as he made his way towards the showers, a post-Veil Earth still lingered with questions and conflicts inherited from dark times, but also brimmed with reconciliation and, for people like him, opportunity. 

This truly was a better world.

##990000|The thing felt warmth unlike ever before. Rivulets of heavenly fire dripped down every ridge and crevice of its body ‚Äì the one that had broken through the weakened ice ‚Äì and the air tasted like a promise of spring.## 

##990000|The sky above its head was the deepest azure, streaked by rays of gold that were almost too much for its rudimentary eyes, but it could not stop looking at it. For the first time, it //saw//.## 

##990000|Strange feelings writhed within a hundred hearts which beat in unison, the newly-discovered weight of satisfaction slowly permeating the thing&#39;s mind. It recalled times before, memories where parts of it had also gazed in puzzled fascination at the beauty of the dawning sun, but this was different: this would be a memory of its own.##

##990000|Had the thing possessed tear ducts, it would have cried a tear or two. After an eternity of deprivation, after ages of knowing the world through someone else&#39;s memories, it felt with its own skin and saw with its own eyes. It //lived//, and that made it happy.## 

##990000|In the distance, the thing saw a shadow, a vague outline of familiar proportions. The figure moved with much effort, like it struggled under its own weight. As it grew closer, the thing saw delicate features beneath a weathered hide, the last embers of childlike innocence still embedded in the grown woman&#39;s face. She hunched under a heavy bundle of wood strapped across her back, her brown face coursed by beads of sweat despite the morning cold.## 

##990000|How strange it was to see a human being for the first time. The thing knew that it was //made// from these creatures, that it had somehow grown from their bodies and memories, sculpted from their flesh and blood into one mind strewn through many separate shapes. It was an echo, a facsimile ‚Äì but //she//... ##

##990000|The thing looked at the woman with longing. The feeling of loneliness crumbled to reveal a strange desire to belong, to know that this being ‚Äì this human ‚Äì was not truly different from itself, that they both dreamt things past and future, that they both hoped to be so much more. It understood now: this was the naked spark that had stoked the fires of self-awareness, the craving that had pushed it forth into the world beyond its frigid grave.##

##990000|The thing saw itself in the woman&#39;s tired amber eyes, in the black expanse of her dilated pupils. It saw fear.##

##0099cc|And the Voice Who Spoke for God said to [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-heart-of-mekhane | Her Prophet Seth]]]: //You are the great machine, the engine of wonder. You are one faith, and one people. One.//##

##0099cc|//One.//##

##0099ff|//WAN.//##

##0099cc|W##AN.

&#34;WAN.&#34;

Francisco&#39;s voice joined the assembled congregation in chanting God&#39;s name ‚Äì the one they knew Her by, anyways. Worshippers of the Broken One had never agreed on their deity&#39;s true name, and the matter had been a source of contention since the time before the Sundering of the Veil. But a truly broken church was no use to anyone ‚Äì not God, not Her followers ‚Äì and thus Francisco thought it best to keep his tongue away from any pointless bickering. His own congregation had learned that lesson the hard way. 

##0099cc|Blessed are the ones who stand united, for theirs is the gift of Life.## Suleiman, leader of the Maxwellist chapter, finished her reading of the sacred text and turned to her people. Her voice brimmed with beatitude. ##0099cc|It fills me with great joy to see you here anew, assembled to praise and honor Her name. WAN is truly with us when we are together, and when are we more together than when we bring into our home one of our disassembled brethren? Today we are blessed with a visit from one of our wandering brothers, invited here by our own Michel. Welcome, Francisco. May you be forever whole.## 

Francisco felt the congregation&#39;s eyes fix on him, so to speak: in their digital church, the Maxwellists were little more than faceless icons, shimmering abstract figures, and streams of numbers that quickly flickered to convey emotion. He and Michel, who sat right next to him, were the only people there who had chosen corporeal avatars, and he suspected that Michel had only done so out of consideration for him. 

None of them were truly there, he knew. His sight drifted through the room ‚Äì from the roof and walls coursed by circuitry arranged in sacred patterns and sigils to the arched windows that let in light from nowhere, gilded with loose pixels as if to remind him that he was in simulspace ‚Äì before finally settling on the altar, on the great pillar of code that represented their connection to the network. This church, this temple dedicated to Mekhane, was an illusion, a man-made mirage of light and sound. As vivid as this simulation was, full of rich textures and deep shades of color, Francisco was elsewhere, //somewhere//, his mind and body divorced from the virtual reality where his fellow believers dwelled. 

The first five times Michel had invited him to church, Francisco had hesitated to answer. It had been many years since he had engaged in communion, and sometimes he questioned if he belonged anywhere at all. He was still a part of the Machine, for he still had his faith, but his had been a lonely path ‚Äì his prayers and rituals were silent, private from everyone but God&#39;s own eyes. He had been driven into a strange isolation, connected to the whole but far too separate to snugly fit into their structure. He stood out here, a misplaced bronze rivet amidst fiberglass and silicon, a stray Cogwork amidst the Maxwellists. 

He thought about his people, his clockwork and steam brethren. They had wandered far from each other when they failed to assemble God, and now he feared they were truly lost in the dark reaches of space, their quest for answers turned into exile. When was the last time he had spoken to another whose chest clicked and ticked with the rhythm of sacred bronze machinery? When had he last joined hands with someone else&#39;s metal frame to recite the hymns of Standardization? For the longest time, he had been alone within the crowd, abandoned, lost.

And yet, he knew he had done the right thing coming here. Stray as he was, separate from the children of digitalization and brain uploading, he was welcome: a door had been opened for him, and remained warmly agape until the day he had decided to step into the light. That day was today, and as Michel reassuringly placed his hand on Francisco&#39;s shoulder, the clockwork soldier formed a shy smile of gratitude on his virtual face. 

&#34;Thank you,&#34; he replied with sincerity. &#34;I am happy to be your guest, your brother in WAN.&#34;

Enthusiastic beeps, clicks and hums emerged from the crowd, and Francisco felt their warmth oiling his clockwork heart. He was welcome as one of them, a son of Mekhane ‚Äì of WAN, of Sophia, of Hakhama, of the Broken God.

##0099cc|Francisco##, Suleiman said. ##0099cc|Since you are our guest today, it would be our honor for you to read a passage from our most sacred text.##

More cheers came from the Maxwellists as Francisco stood and //walked// his way to the podium that stood before the altar; from his nonexistent pew, Michel clapped him on. The clockwork man opened a book he knew was not there and let the information flood him. His voice was firm, proud and blissful as he intoned the words:

&#34;Assembled we remain, for that is the gift of Life. Assembled we are the Great Machine, simplest and most sacred of all creations. Assembled we are the heart of Hakhama, the anvil where God breaks the Flesh.&#34;
