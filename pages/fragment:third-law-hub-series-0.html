[[# 7OW]]
++ The Seventh Occult War
[[/=]]

From 1939 to 1945, the world burned in the fires of global war. Terrible new weapons were unleashed and unspeakable atrocities were committed. Strange alliances once thought impossible were forged by necessity, and ancient institutions once thought eternal were swept aside. The Second World War was the greatest and worst conflict in human history.

These stories are not about that war. These are the stories of the other war, the secret war, the Seventh Occult War.
