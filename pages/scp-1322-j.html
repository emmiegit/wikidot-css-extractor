**Item #:** SCP-1322-J

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-1322-J is effectively self-containing, minimal security is required. The break room is to be shut down indefinitely and restricted solely for testing. Testing is currently focused on gaining access to SCP-1322-J-1. Should a site containment breach of a dangerous anomaly or anomalies occur, extra guards will be assigned to prevent access to SCP-1322-J-1.

**Description:** SCP-1322-J is a space-time anomaly two metres in height and one metre across located in Site-27&#39;s break room leading to a parallel universe designated as SCP-1322-J-1. SCP-1322-J appears to lead to an alternate Foundation&#39;s Site-27 break room.

SCP-1322-J-1 appears to be identical to baseline reality, except for its chiral nature. Due to this effect, it is currently impossible for personnel to enter SCP-1322-J-1, as their chiral counterparts will block them from entering. Attempts to collaborate with SCP-1322-J-1 instances will prove fruitless from what appears to be a result of its anomalous chiral nature, and meaningful communication will prove impossible.

SCP-1322-J was discovered by Researcher Cameron Barnes, who proceeded to immediately alert security to the presence of an unknown anomaly. Currently, Barnes is in charge of containment.

**__Test 1__**
**Success:** N
**Action Taken:** Researcher Barnes attempted to enter SCP-1322-J.
**Result:** Researcher Barnes collides with SCP-1322-J-1-Barnes. Barnes attempts to enter the anomaly for 23 minutes, but is blocked by SCP-1322-J-1-Barnes. Testing ends after SCP-1322-J-1-Barnes becomes aggressive.

**__Test 2__**
**Success:** N
**Action Taken:** MTF Eta-15 (&#34;Chess Players&#34;) is ordered to enter SCP-1322-J by any means necessary. 
**Result:** MTF Eta-15 immediately entered hand to hand combat with their counterparts. As expected, neither version of MTF Eta-15 made any progress. Testing was abandoned after MTF Eta-15 deployed grenades, resulting in three members requiring hospitalization.

**__Test 3__**
**Success:** N
**Action Taken:** A drone is deployed towards SCP-1322-J.
**Result:** The drone is blocked by the alternate drone. 

**__Test 4__**
**Success:** N
**Action Taken:** A drone (D-1) is taped on top of another drone (D-2) and sent towards SCP-1322-J at 60 km/h, in the hopes that the impact will throw D-1 into SCP-1322-J-1.
**Result:** D-1 is dislodged by D-2&#39;s impact and thrown towards SCP-1322-J-1, but is blocked by its counterpart that experienced a matching flight pattern.

**__Test 5__**
**Success:** Y
**Action Taken:** D-23432 is ordered to enter the portal on pain of immediate termination.
**Result:** D-23432 appeared confused about SCP-1322-J, insisting it was not anomalous. D-23432 refused to enter SCP-1322-J.

**Item #:** SCP-1322-J

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1322-J is to be removed from the break room and put in secure storage.

**Description:** SCP-1322-J is an indestructible mirror. In approximately 92.9832123% of humans, subjects are convinced that it is a portal to a highly interesting alternate universe.

//I&#39;d like to offer my immediate resignation. -Researcher Barnes//
