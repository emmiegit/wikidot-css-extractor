**00:10:** //The screen cuts to a five-second countdown, each number dominating the screen.//

**00:15:** //A myriad of psychadelic fractals, spirals, and colours, all slowly morphing and shifting for the duration of the scene.//

**00:30:** //The video cuts to a shipyard at night. The psychadelic patterns and their movements are faintly visible, overlaid onto the footage; they remain until the end of the video. The camera is positioned high up, aimed at a docked, almost-complete cargo ship. The entire area is lit by off-screen lights. A timestamp in the top-left corner reads// &#39;Camera 11 ESP Shipyard (NC), 23:18 12/31/2019&#39;. //The dock is unoccupied, and only a few tools and construction materials are visible.//

**05:30:** //Five figures enter view, four of which (&#39;the agents&#39;) are wearing generic Esther Sea People security uniforms; three of the agents are using motorised platform trolleys to move several unmarked containers. The fifth figure (&#39;the captain&#39;), visibly older than the others, is wearing a Foundation-issue captain&#39;s uniform and holding a paper document. In addition to several standard anomalous item crates, one of the trolleys is carrying a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6943 heavy-duty relic briefcase featuring the logo of the Tactical Theology Department;] another is exclusively carrying a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/crash-and-burn casket-sized metal box, which glows a dull red.]//

**06:30:** //Half-way along the dock, the group is approached by a pair of security guards who block the group&#39;s progress. The captain gives the paper document to one of them, then motions for the agents to continue; the other guard moves and blocks them. The first guard retrieves their phone and looks through it - the captain begins arguing with the guards, gesturing for them to leave.//

**07:10:** //Each of the agents retrieve what appear to be IDs and give them to the second guard, who compares them to something on their phone before returning them. The captain does the same, continuing to argue and becoming increasingly aggressive. The first guard periodically checks his phone, shakes his head, and gesturing at the trolleys or the ship.//

**08:05:** //The first guard shows their phone to the second; after a moment they speak to the group briefly, then immediately turn and leave at a fast pace. The second guard talks as they do so, with the first repeatedly shaking his head until they are out of view. The group of five resumes their progress.//

**08:20:** //The group boards the ship. The captain heads directly to the bridge while the others carry the crates somewhere into the ship; they avoid touching the metal box, instead lifting and moving the trolley it is on.//

**08:30:** //The lights in the bridge turn on. The captain wanders around idly, inspecting the room.//

**27:15:** //The captain steps through a doorway into the ship.//

**33:27:** //The captain returns to the bridge, holding a radio in their hand, and immediately sits in the captain&#39;s seat. They hold the radio next to their ear, listening to it and infrequently speaking into it.//

**41:58:** //The captain puts the radio down next to them, sits back in the seat, and rests their arms on the armrests.//

**42:30:** //The timestamp reaches 00:00 01/01/2020. A firework detonates in the distance; simultaneously, the interior of the bridge spontaneously changes into a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6122 sewer tunnel predominantly obscured by a purple gas] - the interior is visibly larger than the exterior of the bridge. The camera is briefly blinded by an intense flash of light originating from the sewer/bridge, after which the bridge&#39;s interior has returned to normal; the captain is talking on their radio, still seated. Several fireworks continue going off in the distance.//

**44:19:** //One of the agents emerges on deck, disembarking onto the docks to observe the ship. They speak into their radio, and the captain responds.//

**44:24:** //A large cloud of steam rises up from the water around the ship; the ship itself begins to glow a dull red. The agent on the docks speaks to the captain, and the glow subsides, with the steam dissipating shortly after.//

**44:32:** //While the captain speaks into their radio, the agent on the dock adjusts their own and begins talking to it. A few moments later, all lights in the dock turn off, excluding that of the ship&#39;s bridge; the security camera immediately switches to night-vision mode, showing the agent readjusting their radio and turning on a flashlight. The agent detaches the gangplank from the ship, then speaks with the captain.//

**45:34:** //It begins to rain; the shower stops after several seconds. The captain stands, steps over to turn the bridge&#39;s lights off, then sits back down again, talking into their radio momentarily.//

**45:56:** //The ship spontaneously disappears. The agent on the dock nods in approval.//

**46:00:** //The ship reappears, approximately a metre lower than before - the vessel&#39;s bouyancy causes it to rise over several seconds, returning to its former height. The bridge lights are already turned on, and one of the agents is with the captain; the other two are on deck with the three trolleys, laden with the containers brought aboard, as well as two new crates. The agent on the dock reattaches the gangplank, and the three on-deck cooperate to unload the trolleys and containers; they directly handle the metal box, which is no longer glowing.//

**46:50:** //The captain and the agent with him descend from the bridge, turning the lights off as they leave, and disembark to join the other three. The agent that remained on the dock speaks into their radio; all the lights in the dock turn back on. As the group begins to depart, one of them spots the camera and alerts the others; one of the agents immediately runs in the direction the guards had left earlier, while the remaining four figures begin talking, their gestures indicating confusion and annoyance.//

**47:03:** //The captain gestures for one of the remaining agents to go after the guards as well; they do so. The captain and the remaining two guards push the trolleys in the direction they had originally come from, leaving the docks.//

**55:08:** //The footage glitches briefly before cutting to black; the timestamp continues in the top-left corner.//

**55:12:** //End of video.//
