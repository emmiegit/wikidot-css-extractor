Robert Hughes&#39; eyes crinkled open as a ray of light shined into his face. 

&#34;Mr. Hughes.&#34; A voice spoke in front of him. &#34;So, I heard you won the lottery. Again. What is this now, the third time?&#34;

&#34;L-- listen, I can, um...&#34; Squinting past the harsh brightness, all Robert could see was a silhouette, its hand on the lamp pointed at him. &#34;I can pay you!&#34; This wasn&#39;t his first rodeo. It&#39;s amazing, really, the number of people who tried to kidnap one of the richest people in the country. &#34;Any amount you want. I-- I could even give you all my winnings if you really want them!&#34; He stalled, wriggling his cuffed hands around behind the cold, metal chair.

&#34;I&#39;m not interested in money, Mr. Hughes, I&#39;m interested in you.&#34;

Robert paused.

&#34;Well, I&#39;m gonna be honest, I&#39;m not really into this, so if you&#39;re trying to seduce--&#34;

&#34;Stop. I mean I&#39;m interested in your //abilities.//&#34;

A pit opened in Robert&#39;s stomach. &#34;My... se--&#34;

&#34;Don&#39;t finish that sentence. You know exactly what I mean. No normal person could win the lottery three times in a row.&#34;

&#34;But, um, if I weren&#39;t normal, then wouldn&#39;t I have been able to escape by now?&#34;

&#34;Yes. So we made precautions. You can stop reaching for the paperclip in your... sleeve pocket? Did you really sew a pocket into the sleeve of your shirt?&#34;

Robert shrugged his shoulders as he quickly grabbed the clip, jamming it into the keyhole of his handcuffs. His right cuff fell loose. &#34;What can I say? I&#39;m kinda used to this.&#34;

&#34;Robert.&#34;

&#34;Yes?&#34;

&#34;You&#39;re locked in a top secret facility in the middle of the desert.&#34;

&#34;Mmhmm.&#34;

&#34;There&#39;s a guard on the other side of the door, which is behind me, someone who was specially trained to catch you.&#34;

&#34;Okay.&#34;

&#34;And even if, by some miracle, you managed to escape, I&#39;d be able to call a team to hunt you down and get you right back in here.&#34;

&#34;Right.&#34;

&#34;Whatever you&#39;re planning, I suggest you don&#39;t follow through, because you&#39;ll end up right back in here with me again.&#34;

&#34;Cool.&#34;

&#34;So. What are you going to do? Sit in that chair and answer my questions?&#34;

&#34;Nah. I&#39;m gonna execute my plan flawlessly.&#34; Robert smirked.

&#34;I&#39;d like to see you--&#34;

&gt; **Incident 6249-01
&gt; Date: 12/03/2019
&gt; Incident Report:** POI-7342 (Robert Hughes) subdued Agent Pines, who had been conducting an interrogation. Using Agent Pines&#39; keycard and uniform, he gained access to a Foundation vehicle, which he used to escape the Site. Security has been unable to locate him as of yet.

------

Agent Pines held an ice pack up to the bump on their head, clicking the **Submit** button on the incident report with their other hand.  

&#34;I swear, I&#39;ll catch you next time,&#34; he muttered. &#34;Lucky bastard...&#34;
