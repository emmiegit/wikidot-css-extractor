**Item #:** SCP-2598

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2598 is to be contained in a Standard Insectoid Containment Cell at Site 19. This cell is to be fitted with a food supply capable of sustaining SCP-2598 indefinitely, as well as a hanging light source[[footnote]] Placed at the request of SCP-2598.[[/footnote]].  Personnel who wish to interview SCP-2598 must first complete 20 hours of training in American Morse Code.

**Description:** SCP-2598 is a Large Yellow Underwing moth (//Noctua pronuba//) wearing a small helmet. Apart from this, and its behavior, no other anomalous characteristics are discernible.

SCP-2598 is able to communicate with humans by colliding with their heads in a pattern consistent with American Morse Code. While SCP-2598 is apparently able to hear and understand English, it is only able to communicate a return message in this manner. Despite having been offered specially-designed automatic translation pads with which it could collide, SCP-2598 has thus far seemed either unable or unwilling to use any such device.

During conversation, SCP-2598 will invariably attempt to redirect the conversation towards a sales pitch for, specifically, a helmet designed for moths.

**Interview 2598-1:** //The following interview was conducted by Dr. Richard Eads, who initially discovered SCP-2598 while on-location in [REDACTED]. Dr. Eads was chosen as the Research Team Leader because of his efforts in containing SCP-2598[[footnote]]According to Dr. Eads&#39; Discovery Report, he first discovered SCP-2598 by noticing its irregular flight patterns, then its helmet, and then later discovering its communicative abilities.[[/footnote]], and his fluency with Morse code. During this interview, Dr. Eads remained seated in SCP-2598&#39;s containment cell, while SCP-2598 communicated to him via its preferred method. All replies were transcribed by Dr. Eads.//

&gt; **Dr. Eads:** Can you hear and understand me alright, SCP-2598?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2598:** YES HELLO DOCTOR I CAN HEAR YOU JUST FINE THANKS TO THE SOUND AMPLIFYING TECHNOLOGY OF MOTH HELM
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Eads:** Excellent. Now, SCP-2598, could you tell me anything about where you originated from?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2598:** I WAS ONCE LIKE YOU DOCTOR AND LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE OUT THERE WITH NO PURPOSE IN MY LIFE UNTIL I DISCOVERED THE BEAUTY OF MOTH HELM ALSO SAFE FOR CHILDREN NO CHANCE OF GETTING STUCK IN THROATS
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Eads:** I see. So you&#39;re saying that you were unable to comprehend spoken language, or communicate as you can now, before you came into possession of the helmet?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2598:** IT WAS LIKE A DOOR BEING OPENED BEFORE ME DOCTOR AND I COULD SEE THE LIGHT IT WAS ALL POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF MOTH HELM WHICH YOU YOURSELF CAN OWN TODAY FOR AS LITTLE AS THREE EASY PAYMENTS OF NINETEEN NINETY NINE
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Eads:** You&#39;re aware, of course, that I could not possibly wear such a helmet? It&#39;s far too small.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-2598 pauses for twenty seconds, is observed spinning counterclockwise around its containment cell light.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2598:** YES BUT PERHAPS YOU HAVE SOME MOTH FRIENDS WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM THE TRANSCENDANT POWER OF MOTH HELM ALSO IS A GREAT STOCKING STUFFER
&gt;
