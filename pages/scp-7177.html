**To:** Terry Snelling
**From:** Marie Oyane
**Subject:** Assignment for the Morning
------
Hey Terry,

Craig told me that you&#39;re the new guy, and that you&#39;re my new &#34;assistant&#34; now. I guess I should say welcome to the team, Terry. 

Craig also sent me some files last night. The Foundation has archived everything we&#39;ve every written or said, and I mean everything. The papers go back to forever ago. I&#39;m supposed to delete the unimportant stuff, but I have to read through it beforehand and make sure I don&#39;t delete anything useful. So, as my new and rearing to please assistant, I&#39;d like you to do it. I&#39;ve attached the files to this message. Just tell me what we should keep when you&#39;re done. 

A bit about it, though, some of it may seem like it&#39;s for the higher-ups to see, but, trust me, because of the freedom of information stuff that came about a few years ago after that big strike, it&#39;s fine. After a while, you won&#39;t think about it. As far as I know, no one has bothered to read all that stuff yet. Why would they, anyway?

I know my tone isn&#39;t what you&#39;d expect from some uptight government organization, but, well, Craig said I&#39;m supposed to tell you what and how it is, and just about everyone here talks like me. Just giving you a fair warning.

But, hey, once you&#39;re a full time work rat, it&#39;ll be the easiest $60,000$ bucks a year you&#39;ve ever earned.

From,
Marie

P.S.-I&#39;ve also attached the 7177 document. Most documents don&#39;t mention 7177, but just read it before anything else so you know what it is.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7177 is to be contained in a standard containment chamber within Site-01. No personnel are to enter the space that SCP-7177 serves as an entrance into under any circumstance.

[[include component:image-block | name=mirror1.jpg | caption= SCP-7177 | width=250px]]

**Description:** SCP-7177 is an ornate mirror. The speculum metal that makes up SCP-7177&#39;s center is reflective. However, it is not tangible. This threshold in question serves as a portal into cosmic space.

SCP-7177 is present on both sides of the portal effect that the anomaly creates. Although SCP-7177&#39;s typical dimensions are 0.5x0.2x1 meters, it has the capability to adjust in size to allow objects larger than its typical dimensions to pass through it, and its dimensions have never been recorded to be larger than 3.2x0.2x6 meters. If any force is applied to SCP-7177 that causes it to move in any way on either side of its portal effect, the corresponding manifestation of SCP-7177 will move at the same rate of the speed, and in the same manner, on the other side. Despite SCP-7177 serving as a portal into space, no vacuum effect or consequence of the large pressure difference between both entrances into SCP-7177 has ever been recorded. 

A star and several planets have been recorded to be within a close proximity to the area of space SCP-7177 serves as a portal to, although the exact distances to these cosmic bodies are unknown. This area otherwise appears to be unremarkable, although, there is a slightly above average concentration of debris in the area when compared to the rest of interplanetary space, such as stone, metal, wood, and synthetic material. Materials that do not naturally occur in space, such as the previously mentioned wood and synthetic materials, are theorized to have been left by humans on previous expeditions into the space.

My Good Friend, Director Simmons,

As a representative of the recently formed Foundation personnel workers&#39; union, I&#39;d like to extend my deepest thanks for accepting our requests. I am well aware that the path has been filled with bumps, but I&#39;m very happy that some progression has been made, even if far past overdue. I, and all of your other now happy, healthy, and rested employees, look forward to the future where we can work together to build a greater SCP Foundation.

Thank you for your time,
Alexei Kosonovich

+ Note to Employees, 07/05/9601
----
+++ Hello, this is Site Director Simmons. Let&#39;s just get this done quickly.

Really? Seriously, strikes? What the hell are you on about? I&#39;ve read your little manifesto, or &#34;demands&#34;, as you call it. Not just your pamphlet, I&#39;m looking at your newsletter as I write this. &#34;Undignified workload?&#34; &#34;Freedom of information?&#34; &#34;Mind-numbing?&#34; Are we living on the same planet?

You work possibly the most comfortable job in the world. You spend Foundation time on pushing pencils and stacking files, and you demand to play on your phone as you do it? When I was as young as half of you are, I worked my hands to jelly at the Rye-on-Shirely steel mill, and you didn&#39;t hear a chirp from me.

What really gets me is the &#34;undignified&#34; part. Some great men and women, all better than you or me, have worked till the grave, plus overtime, for this place. The Foundation isn&#39;t a job. It isn&#39;t something you can just strike on. It&#39;s a lifestyle. I&#39;m sorry that many of you don&#39;t feel this way, but that&#39;s just your problem, frankly. 

I understand that our work sometimes feels...confusing. Some may ask why we do it, or why we do it in the way we do. I&#39;m not at liberty to totally answer these questions. But what you need to know that those that are no longer with us knew that keeping this place around is important, and the way we do it is just as crucial. If you change a spritz of a big thing, you might realize too late that that little piece of the whole held up much more than you thought it did.

You people strike when you can&#39;t play games at work. You&#39;re children. So, no, I will not meet a single one of your demands. Stop playing this stupid game before you eat up your savings.

+ STRIKE FOR WORKERS RIGHTS: BEGINS 03/05/9601

^^CALL TO ACTION FROM THE SCP FOUNDATION WORKERS RIGHTS ASSOCIATION^^
----
This pamphlet has reached your office door, or your computer screen, or your windshield (or anywhere else you may have found it) for a reason. That reason is simple: we believe that you agree with us when we say enough is enough. But who are we? 

We are an association of hardworking, like-brained Foundation employees, just like you. Have you ever organized boxes on one end of a room, and when you finished, your supervisor comes over and says to move it back? We&#39;ve done that. Have you ever been given hours worth of old files to read, just to skim them all and delete them anyway? We have. Have you ever thought that you&#39;ve just been given a day&#39;s worth of busywork? Don&#39;t even start with us.

The point here is that our work is monotonous and unfulfilling. To fix this, we demand the following:

* Increased transparency of reason for action taken by management and higher ranking superiors.
* Discontinuation of document classification system, as to promote the freer flow of information.
* More clear managerial instructions
* Allowal for employees to entertain themselves (within reason) when their current task has been completed and they are awaiting the assignment of another task

We hope that we can both at least agree that, at the end of a day&#39;s work, we should feel as if we&#39;ve accomplished something. Please join us on May 3rd in strike to help make this change possible. Please contact Superior Researcher Alexei Kosonovich, Computer Technician Raheem Belghoul, or Assistant Researcher Ken Patterson for more information.

//Just so you know, these are some FoundationTalk messages. You&#39;ll acclimate to them soon enough, it&#39;s pretty much what we use when we want something less formal than computer messages. And, when you have to sift through them for work, they give you little snippets of conversations to read sometimes. It&#39;s weird.-Marie//

----
++* ##black|Conversation: A. Kosonovitch/R. Belghoul##
-----
[[/=]]

##black|**A. Kosonovitch:** Hey Raheem, could I talk to you for a minute?##

##black|**R. Belghoul:** OK##

##black|**A. Kosonovitch:** I&#39;ll get to the point. No one talks about this, and I&#39;ve just been getting more and more heated about this ever since my 2nd month here. What we do for work is the most monotonous, pointless shit possible.##

##black|**R. Belghoul:** Hold on, don&#39;t you realize this is FoundationTalk? The higher-ups can read this chat.##

##black|**A. Kosonovitch:** I don&#39;t care man, we both know it&#39;s true. What&#39;s worse, I&#39;ve read through whatever records I can, and nothing has changed for forever.##

##black|**R. Belghoul:** I get what your shooting at, I&#39;m just not going to go hungry over my work being boring.##

##black|**A. Kosonovitch:** Gore, and I thought you had some integrity. I know you. You&#39;re not the type of person to be selling your dignity for $30$ per hour. How can you stand with us doing absolutely nothing for eight hours a day for a bit more than minimum wage?##

##black|**A. Kosonovitch:** Raheem, just think about what you did yesterday. You won&#39;t tell me, but I sure as hell know. You&#39;re a computer guy, so you probably did more of that stuff, but I&#39;d wager I&#39;m my favor that our days were mostly the same.##

##black|Yesterday, I waited an hour for my manager to give me some work. A shanked hour. Then, he had me help him move his cactus pot from his office to the break area plants&#39; space. It was maybe a kilo, he could&#39;ve moved it himself. Then, we moved it back because he didn&#39;t like how it looked.##

##black|Then, he dumped a bunch of files on me to read. Useless crap, nobody can tell me why we archive it all. I remember it being a bunch of cafeteria menus from 150 years ago, with some other stuff spritzed in. He gave me an hour to read them and get rid of the stuff we didn&#39;t need. I didn&#39;t look at a single one and deleted it all after 45 minutes.##

##black|The manager then came in again, and we had some small talk. I tried to bring up some stuff that interested me. 7177, mostly. Any new research being done? Classified. Anything coming from it? Classified. Anything interesting about it at all? Classified. The only thing he would talk about was our new water closet paper, that scratchy, thin, cheap crap.##

##black|**A. Kosonovitch:** Our job is to be office rats. That&#39;s it. We &#34;Secure, Contain, Protect&#34; but all we have is 7177, and we can just lock it in a room.##

##black|**A. Kosonovitch:** Hell, why do we even have 7177 in the first place? It&#39;s the only thing in containment, and we have so many questions. Where does it come from? How does it work? I have no goring clue, and they won&#39;t even assign me to it to find out. They recruited me as a researcher, but I&#39;ve yet to see the science being done in this place. Even if I was assigned there, they wouldn&#39;t start any research anyway. Why? Classified.##

##black|**A. Kosonovitch:** There&#39;s something going on, I know it. Everything&#39;s goring classified. But some things I&#39;ve read, stuff like old reports and memos, have this weird...feel to them, you know? Like there&#39;s a few missing bricks we need to finish building the house, and I&#39;d bet it&#39;s why this place is so pointless. Is it some big money laundering scheme? Is it some secret government plot? Is it other anomalies? I think the latter?##

##black|**A. Kosonovitch:** Think about it, where&#39;s 7176? 7178? [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/taboo 4000]? [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3630 3630]? [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-709 709]? Why do we only have 7177?##

##black|**A. Kosonovitch:** All great questions, but people are too busy cowering in fear over falling off the career wagon to ask them. Someone&#39;s just gotta step up and say &#34;screw the protocols&#34;.##

##black|**A. Kosonovitch:** Anyway, the point is that me and some other guys are planning to strike. Yeah, you heard me. We&#39;re going to strike over our job being boring, and we&#39;re goring proud of it. I know you&#39;ve got connections, and you&#39;re good with computers. I want you to help us out.##

##black|**A. Kosonovitch:** Read my messages, Raheem.##

##black|**A. Kosonovitch:** Please don&#39;t ignore this, man, this is serious.##

##black|**R. Belghoul:** Hmm##

++* ##black|NOTICE TO THE FOUNDATION DEPARTMENT OF CULTURAL GUIDANCE##

----

##black|Hello everyone.##

##black|It&#39;s been an honor serving as the head of the Department of Cultural Guidance, and it&#39;s been an even greater honor meeting, and working with, some of the best people I&#39;ve ever happened upon knowing in my life. However, it is my unfortunate burden to tell you all (what I hope is, even if that may sound bad) a blow to your spirit: the Foundation Office of Cultural Guidance is to be dissolved, as of 17/08/8115.##

##black|It broke my heart to hear the news from Administrator Jacksons, but I have to say that I agree with his decision. We&#39;ve done our job, people. We&#39;ve not been the best possible, but we&#39;ve been mostly successful, I&#39;d say. Do we use dollar signs once when describing a value? No, we put one before and after the number. But do you sign your computer mail the same way people did millennia ago? Yes. However, our influence is no longer necessary or effective.##

##black|Pensions are available for those who have been employed for 20 years or more. Those with less experience, and those who want to retire later, are free to request a new position, or to explore new opportunities in other fields of employment. Your non-disclosure agreement still applies, however. Do not tell anyone about your time at, or about the existence of, the Department of Cultural Guidance, unless that person holds Level 4 Clearance or above.##

##black|Goodbye and good luck,##
##black|Patrick Rodriguez##

+++ Cultural Study 399051.d, Conducted by Agent Markovič on 08/22/7693
[[/=]]
**Media Viewed:** Incomplete video copy of the 1994 film //Pulp Fiction//.

**Important Details of the Media:** The media viewed is a low quality video capture of the 1994 film //Pulp Fiction//. The footage depicts events in the film at a slightly faster rate of speed than most other physical and digital copies of said film in Foundation possession. The recording begins at the timestamp 0:00 in film, and concludes at the timestamp 34:03 in a typical copy of the film.

**Details of Cultural Importance:**At the timestamp 13:38-13:42 in the media, Jules Winnfield (played by actor Samuel Leroy Jackson) is quoted to say &#34;I dare ya, I double dare you motherfucker, say &#39;what&#39; one more god damned time!&#34; 

The word &#34;fuck&#34; is of considerable importance, as the use of the word in this media corroborates with other media that &#34;fuck&#34; was a profane term in the late 20th century. Although &#34;fuck&#34; carries a sexual connotation in this media, evidence collected from various sources that are dated to be from the general time period where //Pulp Fiction// carried cultural relevance shows that the word was also utilized as an expletive in entirely non-sexual circumstances. 

This media supports the common observation made about the profanity utilized from the 16th-21st centuries (although, expletives carrying sexual connotations remained popular until the 28th century) and those utilized in the modern day. Common expletives in the former time period often carried sexual connotations (fuck, bitch, cunt, etc.), and common expletives in the latter time period often carry violent connotations (gore, mutilate, shank, etc.)

**Recommended Future Actions:** The reintroduction of expletives carrying sexual connotations is to be done via their increased use on Foundation omninet synthetic intelligence cultural influencers on various social platforms. Expletives carrying violent connotations are to be stigmatized via similar means, and are also to be criticized as vulgar by Foundation-influenced public officials. 

These suggested actions are estimated to have a %07% success rate.

|disruption-class= dark
|risk-class= caution
]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7177 is to be contained in a standard containment chamber within Site-01. No personnel are to enter SCP-7177-1 under any circumstances.

[[include component:image-block | name=mirror1.jpg | caption= SCP-7177 | width=250px]]

**Description:** SCP-7177 is an ornate mirror. The speculum metal that makes up SCP-7177&#39;s center is reflective. However, it is not tangible. This threshold in question serves as a portal into Dimension-0002, which is to be referred to as SCP-7177-1.

SCP-7177 is present on both sides of the portal effect that the anomaly creates. Although SCP-7177&#39;s typical dimensions are 0.5x0.2x1 meters, it has the capability to adjust in size to allow objects larger than its typical dimensions to pass through it, and its dimensions have never been recorded to be larger than 3.2x0.2x6 meters. If any force is applied to SCP-7177 that causes it to move in any way on either side of its portal effect, the corresponding manifestation of SCP-7177 will move at the same rate of the speed, and in the same manner, on the other side. Despite SCP-7177 serving as a portal into an alternate dimension, the environmental conditions of SCP-7177-1 do not appear to affect standard reality.

SCP-7177-1 resembles space. A star and several planets have been recorded to be within a close proximity to this area, although the exact distances to these cosmic bodies are unknown. This area otherwise appears to be unremarkable, although, there is an above average concentration of debris in the area when compared to the rest of interplanetary space, such as stone, metal, wood, and synthetic material. Materials that do not occur in space, such as the previously mentioned wood and synthetic materials, are theorized to have been left by humans on previous expeditions into SCP-7177-1.

++* ##red|LEVEL 6 CLEARANCE REQUIRED##
----
**Security Clearance Adequate: Access Authorized**
[[/=]]

**Addendum.7177.1:** SCP-7177, as of 4/16/2386, served as a portal into an area of SCP-7177-1 that is an alternate version of Earth. 

SCP-7177-1&#39;s alternate version of Earth appeared to have experienced large-scale destruction and environmental damage. The color of the sky during the daytime was a dark red hue. Chemical makeup testing and individuals who have inhaled the air present in the atmosphere have reported a noticeable presence of smoke. Although what appear to be man-made structures were present in the anomaly, no humans native to SCP-7177-1 have ever been recorded to exist.

SCP-7177-1&#39;s alternate version of Earth was almost entirely populated by sparse plant life and anomalous entities, and there were several anomalous phenomena and objects recorded to have been present within the SCP-7177-1. Further research into this is impossible, however, as SCP-7177-1&#39;s alternate version of Earth was destroyed at an indeterminant time between 16/04/2386 and 07/12/2388.

This addendum will become unavailable for viewing on 08/08/2389, and the remainder of this document will become unavailable for viewing on a date that is to be determined. Reproductions of any of this document are strictly prohibited under penalty of termination.

##black|ow the hell do you plan to fix this mess? We&#39;ve got 4 **[[DATA CORRUPTED]]** explain that? What do we do?##

##black|**L. Potrozski:** Standard Foundation secrecy measures. Your men knew their families would be lied to in situations like this.##

##black|**V. Vannoli:** I just never thought it would actually come to this.##

##black|**V. Vannoli:** So what next?##

##black|**L. Potrozski:** Exploration into SCP-7177-1 has been banned permanently, it looks lik **[[DATA CORRUPTED]]** destroyed soon enough anyway. As per what Cultural Guidance has already been saying, it&#39;s a danger to the Foundation and society. Protocol said to never go through 7177. Now, we just have a reason to ban it for good. It&#39;s your department&#39;s fault for what happened to those men, anyway##

##black|**V. Vannoli:** And, now that we can&#39;t go back into 7177-1, what do you expect us to do with the information we already have?##

##black|**L. Potrozski:** Good question. What will ha **[[DATA CORRUPTED]]** classification of the exploration and the main document, and eventually the idea of alternate dimensions will be forgotten. I have revision 19 of the 7177 document ready to go when it&#39;s time, and it WILL be the final revision. I guess, in the meantime, you can help support Cultural Guidance&#39;s projects.##

##black|**V. Vannoli:** So, my department gets screwed over by yours?##

##black|**L. Potrozski:** I wouldn&#39;t put it like that, but yes.##

##black|**V. Vannoli:** Great. You culture guys get the finishing say again. What are you going to do now, convince people they should start calling computing machines &#34;computers&#34; again?##

##black|**L. Potrozski:** That&#39;s how it was before O55-Bakersfield, so yes, it&#39;s part of our job description. That one looks like it will be successful, too.##

##black|**V. Vannoli:** Oh, please.##

##black|**L. Potrozski** I&#39;m don&#39;t want to give you the speech again. The Cultural Guidance Department is simply following the founding philosophy of the Foundation, that being that anomalies are socially disruptive. Now that we have no more anomalies, we just handle other forms of social disruption.##

##black|**V. Vannoli:** Like any sort of change in a 300 year-old culture?##

##black|**L. Potrozski:** It&#39;s what worked. Keeping the boat from rocking is what the Foundation has always bee##

**Exploration Team:** Mobile Task Force Nu-13 &#34;Date With Destiny&#34;

**Subject:** SCP-7177-1

**Team Lead:** N13-Com

**Team Members:** N13-1, N13-2, N13-3

//Foreword: Due to the efforts of SCP-7177&#39;s research team and the wider Foundation research department towards the authorization of an exploration into SCP-7177-1, the O5 Council temporarily waived the prohibition on entry into the anomaly. This allowed an exploration into SCP-7177-1 to be conducted. All members of the squad are equipped with sample collection drones. Video feed begins as the squad is within a close proximity to SCP-7177 within its containment chamber.//

[BEGIN LOG]

**Command:** One minute until insertion, Nu-13

**N13-Com:** Great, Command. How&#39;re we holding up, guys?

**N13-3:** Good, commander.

**N13-Com:** Good to hear, Patrick. Dusanek?

**N13-2:** I&#39;m ready. Let&#39;s get this done.

**N13-Com:** That&#39;s the spirit. Nate?

//N13-1 draws his sidearm from his holster, and he loads a cartridge of ammunition into the weapon. He smiles.//

**N13-1:** Let&#39;s fuck some shit up.

//N13-Com gestures to N13-1 for him to lower his firearm, which he does.//

**N13-Com:** Woah, woah. I like the enthusiasm, but let&#39;s remember our gun safety, okay?

**N13-1:** Alright, dad.

**N13-Com:** Don&#39;t forget that I know the man. If I was your dad, I&#39;d already be giving you a licking for pulling that little stunt you just did.

//N13-1 snorts, removes the ammunition loaded into his sidearm, and returns it to its holster.//

**Command:** 30 seconds to insertion.

//N13-2 begins to gesture with his fingers as he speaks certain words, presumably to clarify that he is quoting N13-1&#39;s speech.//

**N13-2:** What &#34;shit&#34; are we going to &#34;fuck up&#34; anyway?

**N13-Com:** Not sure. What do we know about this place, Command?

**Command:** Very little, N13-Com. The prohibition on entering SCP-7177-1 was only recently lifted, so we have only had enough time to test the air for chemical makeup and pathogens before the research team forcibly begun the exploration. They said they wanted to conduct the expedition before administration changed their minds.

**N13-Com:** And the air?

**Command:** It&#39;s breathable, although not healthy to do so for long. 

**N13-Com:** Copy that.

**N13-1:** So, we&#39;re going in blind?

**N13-Com:** Looks like it, Nate.

**N13-3:** (//quietly, muttering//) This should be fun.

**Command:** 10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1. Operation is clear to begin, Nu-13. N13-Com, begin at your discretion.

**N13-Com:** Copy that. Alright, let&#39;s get moving, guys. No point in waiting.

//All members of the squad translocate to be within a close proximity of SCP-7177-1&#39;s alternate version of Bakersfield, American State. The sky is colored a red hue, and it appears that the time of day is twilight. All members of the squad pass through the center of SCP-7177, and regroup within SCP-7177-1.//

**N13-1:** Fuck, it is dark here. Air&#39;s smoky, too.

**N13-3:** Yep. Lights on?

**N13-Com:** Yeah, lights on, guys.

//All members of the squad activate their head-mounted illumilights.//

**N13-Com:** Let&#39;s set our drones&#39; home here.

//All members of the squad edit their sample collection drones&#39; &#34;Home&#34; setting on their cellphone&#39;s SCP Foundation app to allow said drones to return to SCP-7177 if prompted. N13-2 turns to face one of several bright, vibrating lights present in the near vicinity.//

**N13-2:** Woah, what are those? 

**N13-1:** What?

**N13-2:** The little lights over there.

//N13-2 points at the light he is facing towards. The lights are of varying shapes and sizes, and are vibrating in place.//

**N13-3:** Yeah, what are those?

**N13-2:** Looks like fireflies.

**N13-1:** Yeah, meter and a half long fireflies.

**N13-Com:** Our lights don&#39;t seem to make them less visible, either. Command, how should we continue?

//Site Command deliberates for nine seconds.//

**Command:** You should try to make physical contact the lights, N13-Com, but not with your body.

**N13-3:** I&#39;ll do it, commander.

**N13-Com:** Alright, Patrick, but don&#39;t be too brave, and definitely don&#39;t piss them off. 

//N13-3 approaches the nearest bright light to him and raises his rifle. He ceases movement directly adjacent to it, and attempts to make contact with the light with his firearm. All attempts to do so cause N13-3&#39;s rifle to phase through the light. The light does not react to this.//

**N13-3:** Huh. The light doesn&#39;t even seem to come from anything, it&#39;s just flying around.

**Command:** It is noted, N13-3. Regroup and continue. We do not advice you to enter the urban area, Nu-13, as it could be potentially dangerous.

**N13-Com:** Copy that. 

//N13-Com gestures with his arm.//

**N13-Com:** This way, guys.

//N13-3 returns to the location of the remainder of the squad. They begin to move in a northerly direction on an unpaved road. The area is largely a flat, arid, open space, with no visible life.//

//The squad continues moving on the road for 19 minutes. No notable events occur. During this time, expired plant life is occasionally visible in the video feed on the ground, This plant life almost entirely consists of an unknown species of vine. The squad then discovers a large mass adjacent to the road, and moves into the effective range of their illumilights to illuminate the mass.//

**N13-2:** What the...

//The team ceases movement when they are adjacent to a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-667 large mass of desiccated vines]. The plant matter that makes up the mass appears to have expired. The size of the mass is unclear, although later estimates show that it is approximately three kilometers long, 200 meters wide, and two meters high at its highest point. What appears to be a heavily damaged flyoplane is visible in the mass, although there is no engine attached to its wing.//

**N13-2:** That&#39;s a lot of vines.

**N13-1:** (//sarcastically//) What an acute observation.

**N13-2:** Well, is it not?

**N13-Com:** (//quietly//) Shoot, man...

//N13-3 turns to face N13-Com.//

**N13-3:** What is it, commander?

**N13-Com:** Well, it&#39;s just...I used to have these vines that grew on my backyard fence as a kid. Cool looking stuff, even if my parents didn&#39;t like it. One summer, it didn&#39;t rain, and those vines started dying. They would shrivel up, pieces would fall off, and it would keep happening until the the part near the roots died, and you would just have this little plant corpse. Seeing that, and all the little bits of vines back there, I think that this is the middle, and, and...Jesus.

**N13-3:** This was just the center of the vines? It used to be way bigger?

//N13-Com nods his head.//

**N13-3:** Woof...

(//Pause.//)

**N13-Com:** It&#39;s fine, it&#39;s dead now, just...let&#39;s keep moving.

//The squad begins to move further along the road in a northerly direction. Nothing eventful occurs. After 7 minutes and six seconds, the squad discovers the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4120 carcass of a yellow domesticated dog of the Big Land breed] placed on the road. A human skeleton is directly adjacent to it. The domesticated dog carcass does not show any external signs of decomposition, and the word &#34;HELL&#34; is written in several locations on its coat in large block letters. The causes of death for both bodies are unknown.//

//Nothing eventful occurs for another nine minutes and 48 seconds. The squad then discovers a large sign made of heavily deteriorated wood placed at a road junction. The words &#34;THEY LEFT US AND BLAMED THE GOVERNOR. THEY CAN AT LEAST GIVE US FOOD. CACHE AT SITE-47, TURN LEFT AND GO RIGHT AT NEXT SIGN.&#34; are written on the sign. The squad ceases movement.//

**N13-Com:** We&#39;re at a fork in the road, command. How should we continue?

//Site Command deliberates for 37 seconds.//

**Command:** We advise that you continue down the left route in the road. Follow the signs, unless it&#39;s a danger to the lives of you or your squad mates.

**N13-Com:** Copy that. Let&#39;s get a move on, guys, we&#39;re going to whatever this &#34;Site-47&#34; is.

//The squad begins to move down in a westerly direction along the road. The squad enters a wooded area after four minutes and 39 seconds. Nothing eventful occurs for another three minutes and 13 seconds.//

//The squad then encounters another sign made of heavily deteriorated wood adjacent to the road which has the words &#34;TAKE A RIGHT AND KEEP GOING. 25 MINUTES TO THE SITE.&#34;//

**N13-Com:** Let&#39;s take that right, guys.

**N13-1:** (//quietly, sarcastically//) Yay, more walking...

//The squad follows the instructions of the sign, and begins to move in a northerly direction.//

//The squad moves for 14 minutes and 27 seconds, at which point they enter a clearing in the wooded area. The stakes in the ground, fire pit in the center of the area, and tent poles and small pieces of nylon scattered around the area suggest that this clearing was previously utilized as a campsite. There are several pieces of furniture placed in the area, such as chairs, tables, and water coolers, that would be generally considered inappropriate for a typical campsite. There is a sign made of heavily deteriorated wood placed near the area that has the words &#34;HOSPITAL CAMP, SITE-47 TRAVELERS GO AROUND.&#34; written on it.//

//There are several heavily decomposed human skeletons in the area, with most of them placed near the edge of the clearing. Each skeleton has experienced some degree of damage in largely unique ways. There are also three [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-217 structures composed of gears and clockwork constructed in a humanoid shape] in this assembly.//

//N13-2&#39;s video feed shows a deteriorated human skull placed near the firepit. There are several teeth that appear to have [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2450 grown into the nasal cavity, eye sockets, and ear canals.]//

**N13-2:** What the fu-? Jesus...command, we&#39;ve ever seen something like this?

(//Pause.//)

**Command:** No, N13-2, that skull is like nothing any medical expert in this room has ever examined before. Attach it to your sample collection drone and send it &#34;Home&#34;.

//N13-2 attaches the skull to his sample collection drone and prompts it to return to SCP-7177. The drone successfully transports the skull to SCP-7177. However, when Foundation agents are transporting the skull through SCP-7177 to standard reality, all teeth and roots not located in the typical dental arch demanifest. DNA analysis of the skull show it to be identical to humans. The time of death is estimated to have been approximately 200 years ago.//

//The squad continues in a northerly direction for eight minutes and 47 seconds, at which point a large concrete structure becomes visible. A concrete wall with sharpened wire placed on its highest section surrounds the structure, although there are several locations where the wall has collapsed.//

**N13-3:** This must be Site-47, huh?

**N13-1:** Looks just like the place I&#39;d want to eat at.

//N13-2 and N13-Com lightly chuckle.//

**N13-Com:** Well, I hope you like it, because we&#39;re going in there.

**N13-1:** Like it? It&#39;s just like my Gran&#39;s place up in Dakota.

**N13-Com:** Just get in there, you.

//N13-Com gestures N13-1 to continue forward, and the remainder of the squad follows him through an opening in the wall.//

//The structure is a largely rectangular, concrete building. An entrance area with a wall composed of glass panes is located on the side of the structure the squad is facing, although, all of the glass panes presumably previously placed in the wall are shattered. A large Foundation insignia and the words &#34;SCP Foundation&#34; and &#34;Site-47&#34; are engraved into the structure above the entrance area. A smaller, crude engraving is also visible, with the words &#34;FUCK YOU&#34; engraved on the structure wall. Several large openings in the building&#39;s concrete structure, and the area surrounding the building, are visible.//

**N13-1:** Yep, just like Gran&#39;s place.

//N13-2 lightly strikes N13-1 on the back of his head. The squad then enters the entrance area of the structure.//

//The squad enters a large, dilapidated room. There is no lighting, and the squad entirely relies on their illumilights for visibility. The area is largely undecorated, although furniture attached to the structure itself, including several desks located on the side of the room opposite to the squad, are present. There are several water leakages present in the ceiling. There is a fire-flight staircase, a general use staircase, and several elevators located along the walls of the building, although several elevator doors are open despite the lack of an elevator present on the floor.//

**N13-1:** Yeah, just like-

**N13-2:** Shut the fuck up. The joke&#39;s over.

**N13-3:** Definitely. What the hell is up with this place?

**N13-2:** Judging from the stuff outside, it looks like some old Foundation stuff.

**N13-3:** That doesn&#39;t make sense, the Foundation hasn&#39;t ever even been in 7177-1 until now.

**N13-1:** It&#39;s an alternate universe, man, anything can happen. This looks like a reception area, there&#39;s just no place to sit. 

**N13-3:** Maybe somebody stole the stuff at that camp from here?

**N13-Com:** We&#39;ll find out. Command, how do we continue.

**Command:** Go down the stairwell, Nu-13. Explore the floor that seems as if it would have the most valuable information.

**N13-Com:** Copy that.

//The squad moves to the entrance of the general use stairwell. However, the stairwell is inaccessible, as the stairs that make up the stairwell are largely destroyed, making a safe descent deeper into the structure impossible.//

**N13-3:** Shoot.

**N13-2:** How do we get down?

(//Pause.//)

**N13-1:** Fire-flight?

**N13-Com:** Yeah, that actually might work. Let&#39;s try that.

//The squad relocates to the fire-flight stairwell, which is in considerably better condition than the general use stairwell.//

**N13-Com:** Nice thinking, Nate.

**N13-1:** The only time you&#39;ll ever tell me that.

//N13-Com scoffs. The squad begins to descend down the stairwell. They descend down 17 flights of stairs. N13-Com ceases his movement, and he gestures for the other members of the squad to do so. There is a doorway labelled &#34;Keter Level Containment/Storage C&#34; nearby the squad. There is no door present in the doorway.//

**N13-Com:** Let&#39;s stop here, this should be good.

**N13-1:** Why did we have to go down all those stupid stairs? Why not just choose Level 1 for now?

**N13-Com:** Because no one would keep anything important near the top. We have to go deeper to find the cool stuff.

**N13-1:** Alright, fine.

//The squad moves through the doorway into a dilapidated hallway, although it is in generally better condition than the surface level room of the structure.//

//The squad moves through the structure for one minute and nine seconds. The area appears to be a relatively mundane office space, including several offices, meeting rooms, cafeterias, etc. The squad then encounters a room labelled &#34;[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1447 SCP-1447] Sample Bay-Object Class: Keter&#34;. These words are partially obscured by paint, and below the words &#34;[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-498 SCP-498]&#34; is written crudely with paint. The room appears to be a containment chamber. The room is secured by large blast doors, although they are not fully closed.//

**N13-Com:** Command, we&#39;ve encountered something that might be dangerous. How should we proceed?

**Command:** Enter the room, Nu-13, but be cautious. We will look through records and known human languages to see if we can discover what this &#34;Keter&#34; means.

**N13-Com:** Copy that. Let&#39;s check it out, guys.

//The squad enters the room. There are several freezers, glass display cases, and medical instruments, but they are all gathered in a large accumulation on the room&#39;s east wall. There is an alarm clock placed on the center of a pedestal in the center of the room. A severely rusted mechanical arm is placed directly adjacent to it. The mechanical arm is connected to a small generator with a cable.//

(//Pause.//)

**N13-2:** What?

**N13-1:** Yep, not what I intended to see

**N13-Com:** Alright guys, I know. Do we have any record of an SCP-498?

**Command:** No.

**N13-Com:** Huh.

(//Pause.//)

**N13-1:** I guess they&#39;ll want this for samples?

//N13-1 picks up the alarm clock.//

**Command:** No, N13-1, we&#39;d rather not delay the expedition by forcing you to return to the surface to launch your drone. Take it with you when you&#39;re exiting this floor level.

//N13-1 places the alarm clock on its side on the edge of the pedestal.//

**N13-1:** Alright.

**Command:** I think we&#39;ve seen enough, Nu-13.

**N13-Com:** Copy that. Let&#39;s keep moving.

//The squad exits the room.//

//The squad then moves further into the structure. There are several openings in the walls and ceiling of the structure. Some of these openings are connected to other rooms, and several of them connect to floors on lower or higher levels. These openings do not appear to be intentionally designed into the structure due to the apparently forceful nature that they were created, as evidenced by their uneven shape and the debris nearby them. Furniture is occasionally seen in inappropriate places, such as in hallways. However, there are no notable events for five minutes and 53 seconds. The squad then ceases movement when they are directly adjacent to a room labelled &#34;[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5965 SCP-5965] Storage&#34;. The door to the room is open.//

**N13-Com:** Let&#39;s check out this one.

**N13-1:** You think it&#39;ll be weirder, or no?

**N13-Com:** Let&#39;s find out.

**N13-1:** I&#39;d rather not find out if it&#39;s, you know, really weird.

//The squad enters the room. There are several freezers located in the room. The tiles that make up the roof have largely caved in due to water damage. The room is in generally worse condition than the rest of the rooms on the level.//

**N13-3:** This room is...strangely familiar. 

**N13-2:** Like déjà vu?

**N13-3:** No, not like that. It&#39;s just similar to other stuff I&#39;ve seen before.

**Command:** You may possibly recognize the similarities between this room and many Foundation mort-

//The faint sound of the alarm of an alarm clock is then heard in the general direction that the squad has just came from. The sound does not cease.//

**N13-1:** What the fuck is that?

//(Pause.)//

**N13-1:** No, it can&#39;t be that alarm clock, can it?

**N13-2:** I don&#39;t know. Can it be, genius?

//The sound of the alarm clock&#39;s alarm becomes noticeably louder.//

**N13-Com:** Wait, we walked away from that thing for like, seven minutes, right? It must be super far away now. And how much building is in between us and it? Command, how loud should that thing be by now?

(//Pauses.//)

**Command:** To be as audible as it is now, our rough estimate is approximately 100 decibels.

//The sound of the alarm clock&#39;s alarm becomes noticeably louder. No member of the squad speaks for seven seconds.//

**N13-Com:** If it&#39;s that loud, and it seems to only get louder...

(//Pauses.//)

//N13-Com takes hold of N13-1&#39;s collar.//

**N13-Com:** (//screaming//) Nate, you fucking idiot! That arm turns the clock off, and you moved it out of its way! We need to get the hell out of here! 

//N13-Com forces N13-1 towards the room&#39;s doorway.//

**N13-Com:** Move! Fucking move, people!

//All members of the squad exit the room and begin to run as a group away from the sound of the alarm clock. However, the sound becomes increasingly louder as the footage continues.//

//After one minute and 41 seconds, the structure begins to be physically effected by the intensity of the alarm&#39;s volume. Glass begins to shatter, objects begin to fall from their previous positions onto the floor, and the squad struggles to run due to the tremors in the structure caused by the intensity of the alarms volume. The squad appears to experience physical pain due to the intense volume of the alarm.//

//After another one minute and 13 seconds, the structure begins to collapse. After 16 seconds, A slab of concrete falls through the ceiling, fatally striking N13-Com and N13-3, and also causing the remainder of the squad to be unable to continue further down the hallway they are running through. The remaining members of the squad attempt to retrace their route, presumably in an attempt to find an exit from the structure.//

//Blood begins to flow from each remaining squad member&#39;s ears. It is presumed that their eardrums have been ruptured. After 17 seconds, N13-1 is struck by several smaller pieces of rubble falling from the ceiling, killing him. N13-2 is mortally wounded due to the floor collapsing under him after 35 seconds, causing him to fall to lower levels of the structure.// 

//After a minute and six seconds, the sound of the alarm clock&#39;s alarm ceases. It is theorized that the alarm clock itself was destroyed by the structure collapsing around it. All camera feeds are of the rubble that has buried the squad members. No notable events occur after this, as the squad members&#39; cameras begin to deplete their battery holds, causing N13-Com&#39;s video feed to cease after six hours and 37 minutes, N13-2&#39;s video feed to cease after another 39 seconds, N13-1&#39;s video feed to cease after another 13 minutes, and N13-2&#39;s video feed to cease after another eight minutes and nine seconds.//

[END LOG]

//Note-Due to the events of this log, further exploration into SCP-7177-1 has been prohibited. At an unknown time between 16/04/2386 and 07/12/2388 (the date of the second entrance of Foundation personnel into SCP-7177-1), SCP-7177-1&#39;s alternate version of Earth was destroyed due to unknown reasons. Anomalous activity on the planet is considered the most likely cause.//

+ Message to the O5 Council, 10/11/2056
----
+++ Hello, this is the Administrator

I&#39;d like to start off by saying this: we&#39;ve done well. 

We figured out a way to throw [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2460 SCP-2460] out of orbit. Operation Candlelight was a complete success, and now the Insurgency is just a shattered husk of what it was. 7177 even helped us put an end to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-871 871] and a couple other world-enders when this all started. 

But, mostly, we&#39;ve just been lucky. Lucky that [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-094 094] has been growing much slower than we thought it would. Lucky that [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-169 169] seems like it&#39;s dead, not sleeping. Lucky that [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4217 4217] didn&#39;t destroy your folks&#39; private yacht when it surfaced near you. Lucky that the Scarlett King hasn&#39;t broken through into our reality yet. Lucky that no one knows about the hell we put ourselves through to keep this whole thing together.

But, in the end, we can&#39;t be lucky forever. No matter how much money and men we have at our disposal, there&#39;s
 no way to get around that we&#39;ve been holding ourselves together with duct tape and bubblegum. And, after everything just started falling apart in March, we all knew our time was almost up. And it is.

We&#39;re done. We&#39;ve delayed it as long as we could, but it&#39;s over. Protocol O55-Bakersfield has been concluded. It breaks my heart to leave so many people behind, we&#39;ve barely got 500 million in 7177-1, but leaving our men to die in the old world, and delaying rebuilding the new, is just a waste now.

However, I can&#39;t help think something about this whole thing is funny, too. The last straw wasn&#39;t a mass exposure to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-096 SCP-096], or the final chain breaking in [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2317 2317]. No.

Yesterday, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4910 4910] ran through Site-93. Half of the staff was killed, and much of the equipment was damaged, including a lot in Storage Area-33. Poor bastards had teeth growing in their lungs. Somehow, it let [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1262 SCP-1262], among others, escape. The thing trapped 4910 downstairs. Maybe it&#39;s dead, who cares? 

So, because of this, it had time to grow into the site. We can&#39;t even get close to it, and its towers keep firing on our helicopters trying to look for survivors. Site-93 and the surrounding area are 1262&#39;s territory now, and our men on the ground are scattered with nowhere to go. We lost their main base of operations. We lost Iceland, and, by extension, the whole North Atlantic. That&#39;s what convinced me to pull the plug on O55-Bakersfield. It&#39;s just a waste of time and lives now. 

But now, we&#39;re in the present, and we look to the future. 

The Foundation WILL stick around, even if we have no anomalies to handle. It may seem pointless, but history shows that the world needs us, or everything just goes off the rails. Even, if in thousands of years, we don&#39;t know why we exist, we must continue to do so in the same way as now. 7177 offers us a chance, and now, the world is on our terms. We will rebuild the society, just like how it was before it was gone. 

Some of you may object to this. I don&#39;t know why you would. 

You may say that putting the world back together like it exactly way is unnecessary. Really? The truth is that the Foundation has always been about control in it&#39;s purest form. That&#39;s not inherently a bad thing, our control has saved humanity countless times. Luck, chance, probability, they all helped us to some degree before, but they also tore us apart in the end. Luck made what we have done, and will do, necessary. What we had works. Leaving the world up to luck is, frankly, foolish. Let&#39;s make our own luck, and control our own destiny.

You may say that we don&#39;t need to exist because there is nothing to contain. On the contrary, anomalies just got in the way of the preservation of society. Any correct understand of how we work sees that as our true goal. We will still exist tomorrow, even without things to keep in boxes and cages. The old, unnatural world won&#39;t be forgotten, it will be buried, and the monsters with it. Only a few of us will know the old, and, even then, they will eventually bury it, too. It will all be destroyed, and future generations will forget it all with time. Eventually, they won&#39;t bother themselves with the old at all. They won&#39;t hurt themselves with the toys we put away.

//Hey Marie, I&#39;m just leaving this message for you. I accidentally put this in between the 2nth to last and last document, and completely truthfully, I just don&#39;t feel like moving it. I kinda slicked by the strike stuff, but I didn&#39;t really read the rest. I guess I&#39;m already developing a SCP Foundation attitude ha ha. We&#39;ll be fine deleting this, it doesn&#39;t look like we need it.-Terry//

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7177 is to be contained in a standard containment chamber within Site-47. No personnel are to enter SCP-7177-1 without the authorization of an appropriate supervisor.

[[include component:image-block | name=mirror1.jpg | caption= SCP-7177 | width=250px]]

**Description:** SCP-7177 is an ornate mirror. The speculum metal that makes up SCP-7177&#39;s is reflective. However, it is not tangible. This threshold in question serves as a portal into Dimension-0HB3AK-C, which has been designated SCP-7177-1.

SCP-7177 is present on both sides of the portal effect that the anomaly creates. Although SCP-7177&#39;s typical dimensions are 0.5x0.2x1 meters, it has the capability to adjust in size to allow objects larger than its typical dimensions to pass through it, although its dimensions have never been recorded to be larger than 3.2x0.2x6 meters. 

If any force is applied to SCP-7177 that causes it to move in any way on either side of its portal effect, the corresponding manifestation of SCP-7177 will move at the same rate of the speed, and in the same manner, on the other side. This principle is true even if it causes SCP-7177 to make contact with an object, which will cause the anomaly to phase through the object in question. Despite SCP-7177 serving as a portal into an alternate dimension, the environmental conditions of SCP-7177-1 do not appear to affect standard reality.

SCP-7177-1 is a dimension that is almost identical to the universe as it was on 01/23/2009, the first day that a human entered SCP-7177-1. The passage of time in SCP-7177-1 does not occur unless a human is present in the dimension. Humans do not naturally exist in SCP-7177-1, despite the man-made structures located within the anomaly.

Anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena have never been recorded to exist within SCP-7177-1. Anomalous objects and entities that enter SCP-7177-1 from baseline reality demanifest when making contact with SCP-7177&#39;s speculum metal center. Anomalous phenomena occurring in baseline reality do not occur within SCP-7177-1, even when SCP-7177 is located within the effective range of an anomalous effect. Amnestics are not capable of function within SCP-7177-1.

++* ##red|LEVEL 5 CLEARANCE REQUIRED##
----
**Security Clearance Adequate: Access Authorized**
[[/=]]

**Addendum.7177.1:** In order to utilize the anomalous effects of SCP-7177, Protocol O55-Bakersfield was developed on 05/23/2014. The following is a description of Protocol O55-Bakersfield.

&gt; SCP-7177 is to be placed in the nearest large population center (as of the time of writing, SCP-7177 is located in Site-47, with the nearest appropriate population center being Bakersfield, California). All civilians and authorized Foundation personnel are to be invited to permanently reside in SCP-7177-1. Foundation elements within SCP-7177-1 are to initially organize the settlement of the anomaly&#39;s alternate version of Bakersfield, California. Foundation secrecy is to be maintained, and all Foundation activities during this time are to be publicly attributed to world governments and international institutions.
&gt; 
&gt; Remaining Foundation resources within baseline reality are to continue current containment protocols, relocate civilians to SCP-7177-1, and combat anomalous elements. Personnel are to inhibit anomalous entities, objects, and phenomena to the best of their abilities from destroying human civilization in baseline reality.
&gt; 
&gt; Protocol O55-Bakersfield is to be undergone only in the event of large-scale containment failure within the Foundation, and the subsequent failure of the Foundation to avert an XK End-of-the-World scenario. The cessation of Protocol O55-Bakersfield marks the end of Foundation efforts towards the preservation of humanity within baseline reality, and the beginning of Foundation efforts towards the building and preservation of human society within SCP-7177-1.
