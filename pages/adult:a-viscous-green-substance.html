//&#34;Furthermore, [[[SCP-447]]]-2 can be refined (see Appendix 447-C: Distillation Process) into a useful lubricant approved for use at all SCP Foundation installations, so long as said lubricant is never used to lubricate dead bodies.&#34;//

------

The junior researcher set the copy of the document down on the desk with a sigh. &#34;...Oh hell.&#34;

&#34;Come on.&#34;

&#34;Dude, I&#39;m not paid enough. And, notably, //my ass// isn&#39;t an &#39;SCP Foundation installation&#39;, it&#39;s just my ass. It&#39;s always been there, Foundation or no Foundation.&#34;

&#34;Well it&#39;s about to be one. Look, I thought you and I had a thing going for a little while there. Hell, I kinda thought we were still-&#34;

&#34;You and I //do// have a thing going, Alto, but that&#39;s between you and I, not you and I and a pile of sludge.&#34;

&#34;Man, I already told the assistant research director that we greenlit this testing-&#34;

&#34;Well, what are you gonna do to convince me?&#34;

&#34;...I&#39;ll cook us waffles in the morning.&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s it? Wait, not- not //those// waffles, right?&#34;

&#34;Oh, no, the normal ones.&#34;

The researcher sighed and stood up out of his chair. &#34;Alright. Deal.&#34;

------

Alto Clef was a man of his word, to say the least. When he told a project director he&#39;d get something done, he got it done. But when the Site&#39;s research heads were pressing for more extensive 447-2 testing, he got a little uneasy. There was only so much people could come up with after a few years of experimentation, after all.

But he was just stressed. It&#39;d all be fine. His flirtatious, wonderful, kind, awkwardly submissive, probably-too-low-of-a-clearance-level boyfriend was waiting for him in the employee quarters. He just had to get that sample and they&#39;d be able to proceed with their plans of last night.

&#34;Where&#39;s that sample?&#34; Clef asked no one in particular, spinning around in his chair.

&#34;Almost here, sir. We had a minor computer error, and couldn&#39;t take it out of the inventory until it was repaired.&#34;

&#34;A computer error? Of what sort?&#34;

&#34;An LMAPO error. Logistical Mapping and Procedural Officiator, the research lab&#39;s AI. You know the one.&#34;

&#34;Ah yes, good ol&#39; LMAPO.&#34;

&#34;LMAPO.&#34;

&#34;Alright, well once you all sort out that LMAPO situation, I&#39;m gonna need to get that sample and turn in for the night.&#34;

A few of the researchers hunched over low-priority tasks in the corner shot confused and concerned glances at each other, but knew better than to question anything.

&#34;Sure. I&#39;ll go down the hall and get it once LMAPO&#39;s self-repair is complete.&#34;

&#34;Marvelous.&#34;

------

Junior Researcher Jaime Abraham sat on the edge of Clef&#39;s bed. He never felt particularly welcome here, between the multiple loaded shotguns in three of the four corners and the vaguely disconcerting scent of stale maple syrup. He twitched his legs. &#34;Nghh, this is gonna be weird-&#34;

&#34;Oh my fuck, Abraham, it&#39;s just lube. I bet this is better than that KY shit we&#39;ve been using.&#34;

&#34;Are you ever gonna call me by my first name?&#34;

Clef put the vial on the nightstand and turned most of the lights off, leaving the room in only the green glow of the emergency light. What a situationally relevant color, he thought. Really set the mood. &#34;Of course not. That&#39;s against protocol,&#34; he explained, stumbling out of his pants.

&#34;Uh...&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m just messing with you. It&#39;s actually because I thought Abraham was your first name up until like three weeks ago, so I still get stuck with it.&#34; He took a condom out of the bedside table&#39;s drawer.

&#34;What? Why?&#34;

&#34;Because they wanted it for the test procedures.&#34;

&#34;No, my name! We&#39;ve been dating for like eight months!&#34;

&#34;It was a simple mistake!&#34;

&#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34;

&#34;It means we don&#39;t want my jizz interfering with the process. This is basic research standard, you know.&#34;

&#34;No, not that, the other thing!&#34;

&#34;Man, don&#39;t worry about it. Let&#39;s just move on. You hard yet?&#34;

&#34;Why do //I// need to be hard?&#34;

&#34;F- I don&#39;t fuckin&#39; know! Because that&#39;s fucking normal? What&#39;s gotten into you, Abraham?&#34;

Abraham grimaced and rolled over onto his stomach. &#34;Don&#39;t you use that head researcher voice at me, it makes it //weird-&#34;//

&#34;It&#39;s always gonna be //weird,// unless you&#39;re on one of my teams.&#34;

&#34;That would be //really// weird. Please don&#39;t ever make me work under you.&#34;

&#34;Uh, phrasing.&#34;

&#34;In a non-sexual way.&#34;

&#34;...This is sexual. We&#39;re about to have sex.&#34;

&#34;Christ alive, you know what I mean.&#34; He closed his eyes and started laughing. &#34;Just fucking start already.&#34;

&#34;Mmm-hmm.&#34; Clef rolled the condom onto his //massive eight-inch[[footnote]] 20.32 cm [[/footnote]] cock// and proceeded to lubricate himself with the 447-2 before grabbing the younger man&#39;s ass in preparation.

&#34;I want a shower already.&#34;

&#34;Just stop thinking of it as anomalous slime and think of it as- I don&#39;t know, something relaxing, like- like-&#34;

&#34;Like what?!&#34;

&#34;I don&#39;t know, fucking coconut-scented tanning lotion or some shit! Some of that fancy shit you like to slather all over yourself!&#34;

Abraham grunted. &#34;Can you slow the fuck down back there?&#34;

Clef looked down in the dim lighting. He //had// slid in easily. He&#39;d have to make a note of that. &#34;Have I ever told you about the time I fucked someone from an alternate reality?&#34;

&#34;Which of the hundreds of GOC missions did //this// one happen on?&#34;

&#34;No no, [[[breach-my-containment-baby|this was just last year.&#34;]]]

&#34;Can you tell me about it at a time when you&#39;re not shoving your dick in my ass? Better yet, can we not make any casual conversation while we&#39;re-&#34;

&#34;Sure, sure. My bad. But dear God, this is slippery.&#34;

------

&#34;You log it; I&#39;m tired.&#34;

&#34;I know, I know.&#34; Clef got up and put his pants back on, thudding down at the computer. &#34;I&#39;m gonna have to add this to the experiment log, you do realize.&#34;

&#34;Please don&#39;t name me in it.&#34;

&#34;Well I don&#39;t wanna name myself either! I&#39;m the fucking project head!&#34;

&#34;Okay, fine, just blame it all on me then-&#34;

&#34;I told the other researchers it&#39;d be you doing it-&#34;

&#34;Do you have a problem with the &#39;other researchers&#39; knowing I&#39;m the bottom or something? Why can&#39;t we tell them it was your dick?&#34;

&#34;No, just- I have my methods, dammit! They won&#39;t notice! Now, what do you have to say about the test?&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m thinking, I&#39;m thinking.&#34; Abraham put his head in his hands. &#34;Ugh, just- just say &#39;I could market this as //that// kind of lubricant, but I don&#39;t think a warning label is enough to ensure that some necrophiliac doesn&#39;t use it on a dead body.&#39; Does that sound comprehensive enough?&#34;

&#34;Of course. All for the sake of research, you know.&#34;

&#34;Yeah, yeah. Go ahead and enter it in the database, I guess.&#34;

&#34;What are you worried about?&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m just wondering if that was safe. I mean, I know it was, but that felt kind of-&#34;

Clef smiled. &#34;But... of course it&#39;s Safe. I wrote the Object Class myself.&#34;

&#34;...God fucking damn it.&#34;
