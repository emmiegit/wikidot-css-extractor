Truth Glamour is a fine powder[[footnote]]Just call it faerie dust. — //Hannah//[[/footnote]] that may part fact from fiction when applied to a claim. In a world of falsehoods,[[footnote]]Not even the Library is safe in this regard. — //Mrghn//[[/footnote]] Truth Glamour remains one of the most reliable ways to find what is right, safe of mundane research.

Once fused to a statement, the glamour will embolden it for everyone to see. But should the glamour be applied to a lie, it will break on contact.[[footnote]]This does not fully capture the glamour nature. — //**##purple|Lavender##**//[[/footnote]]^^,@&lt; &gt;@^^[[footnote]]Accuracy is best reserved for the next section. This serves as a summary. — //Midnight//[[/footnote]]

Now, the reserves of it are running dry, and we may risk forever losing this part of our information ecosystem.

**Knowledge**
[[/=]]

**Traits:** Physically the Glamour takes the form of a fine golden powder. If examined closely, the powder will appear to gleam, regardless of the provided light. In most aspects, it resembles the dust of other Glamours,[[footnote]]Without a doubt, Truth Glamour would make an excellent ingredient for one or the other alchemical mixture. But its rarity hinders experimentation in that regard somewhat. — //L.S.//[[/footnote]] save the spells it is used for.

Like all Glamours, Truth Glamour can be used for the same magic it is extracted from.[[footnote]] Why both the illusion magic and the illusion magic leftover dust are called Glamour is beyond me. — //Hannah//[[/footnote]] Just a few corns of it can be used as a focus for even those of us not graced with the Art to cast spells that relate to truehoods. It is to note that outside of the strongest magic users, very few thaumaturges are able to cast spells of these schools without the Glamour.

Truth Glamour is easily obtained by using an extraction spell or implement on a spell of truehood.[[footnote]]This obviously has strongly diminishing returns. You&#39;re gonna need spells cast without the faerie dust to get an actually usable amount. — //Andvari//[[/footnote]]

**Nature:** The most-used application of the Glamour is to embolden a claim. Anyone gazing at the statement henceforth will be certain the claim has been verified as true. The strength of this certainty is directly tied to how true the claim actually is. The Glamour will turn against the claim should it be revealed to contain even small lies. In this case, a stench will follow the claim, making it plain to see the lie, causing disinterest in it as a whole.

How the Glamour tells truth from lie is not fully known, but a tendency to trust the doubtful eye of a wanderer who often questions themself over one who doesn&#39;t has been reported on multiple occasions. This has led many to speculate that the Glamour determents truehood by judging all observers of the claim the glamour is applied to, which would be in line with the working of the more illusionary glamours.

**History &amp; Associated Parties:** As the Glamour can be extracted from spells of the same name, anyone can theoretically produce Truth Glamour. The difficulty of the spells made in practice deities or creatures of similar scope the most viable source of the Glamour. 

With most deities making use of the required magic only sporadically, the [[[cycle-of-seasons-hub|Cycle of Season&#39;s]]] Summer Court was responsible for the only consistent supply of the Glamour. The Summer Court made decrees about the Truth of reality daily, resulting in an overabundance of the Glamour. Up until the Sixth Occult War, Truth Glamour saw constant use as a tool for veracity, if you had ties to the Court or ties to the people who did. As the [[[poczatki-normalnosci-i-jej-przyszlosc|Sixth Occult War ended]]], the Summer Court vanished.

Without its primary distributor, the Glamour was suddenly hard to come by. Numerous wanderers have looked for an alternative but without much luck.

Next to the negligible amounts produced by other deities and the reuse of old Truth Glamour, the main source of the glamour have become people who stockpiled a resource back in the pre-normalcy era when it was in abundance.[[footnote]] Never underestimate Andvari&#39;s Gift! — //Andvari// [[/footnote]]

Andvari may be approached should you be in need of the Glamour. It is recommended to not seek him out unless the glamour is very important due to the great price Andvari requests in return for it.

Our greatest hope remains to find the Summer Court.

**Approach:** Should a suitable spell be found, getting the glamour is as simple as applying an extraction spell on it. An extraction vial can serve just as well as the spell. But handle with care: do only remove excess glamour less the glamour turns against you. Spells of truehood are faithful things and do not enjoy being separated from their purpose. If glamour is extracted to the point that the spell breaks, the glamour will brand you as an enemy of Truth.

The extracted Truth Glamour may then be used as a focus for any spell of truehood, provided you have enough of it.

**Other Detail:** As with all glamours, Truth Glamour relies on the eye of the beholder. Looking at Truth Glamour or spells of its school will give you Glamsight, as long as you do not avert your gaze. Falsehoods in the periphery of your eye may be revealed this way.

//If you ever tried extracting glamour from a spell today, let me tell you the measly corns you get now are nothing to the harvest in the days of the Court. Each day the Court would settle the Truth of reality with spells so potent that the word spell is a disservice to them. We were drowning in Glamour back then. One decree of the Court would give you enough glamour for a lifetime; of course no one would preserve it.//

//People kept using the glamour like there was no tomorrow for quite a while after the Court vanished. Its absence wasn&#39;t that apparent. Minor workings would break here and there, but the arms of the Court were still there. Heck, the Supreme Summer Court operates in [[[esterberg-city-wikipedia|Esterberg]]] to this day! But a lot of arms went under, closed up or put their focus on normal legalese like the arm in Esterberg does. I wish I could help in the search for the Court, but Andvaranaut only helps me to enrich myself and I still have plenty of Glamour.// — Andvari

By acknowledging the contents of this quote the recipient agrees to enact it to the best of their ability and to not engage with the Supreme Summer Court of Esterberg for the same reason the recipient was judged to be exposed to this quote. This oath restricts the recipient&#39;s conduct with the Court and will take a maximum of 1 hour of their time. Should enacting of the oath take more than one hour the recipient is excused from further enacting it. Demanding this oath is within the rights of the Court. This ruling is final.&#34; I&#39;m sorry.// — Mrghn [[footnote]]That sounds like you drew Edrisglair&#39;s ire.

//There is another instance of the Court that I have looked into as a new potential source for the Glamour.

I extracted Truth Glamour from their workings. Given the unique way one enters their realm, I used the Glamour on a testing blog I had written prior, which I could access as the videogame mirrors the landscape of the internet.// [[footnote]]What a horrid game design decision — //Mrghn//[[/footnote]]^^,@&lt; &gt;@^^[[footnote]]Not that surprising.

//The Hunt for the Court of Summer may not be as hopeless as my fellow Wanderers imply.

**Doubt**
[[/=]]

How well Truth Glamour draws the line between Truth and Lie is up for debate. It is after all hard to verify any claims the glamour has deemed false, with the glamour effects letting them fade into obscurity. And if the glamour truly gets its information from its observer&#39;s perception then it must err. Not even the most self-reflecting and critical eye is always perfect. [[footnote]]But it does not take one, but many eyes to make its call. There is wisdom in crowds. — //Midnight// [[/footnote]]

//The pessimistic outlook on the capabilities of the Essence of Summer leaves much to be desired. With the glamour being a product of the Summer Court, would it not stand to reason for it to reflect objective truth as does the Court itself?//[[footnote]]I have travelled many years and never found such a thing as objective Truth. — //L.S.//[[/footnote]]^^,@&lt; &gt;@^^[[footnote]] How can you say that while staying in the greatest Library of all?  — //Mrghn//[[/footnote]]^^,@&lt; &gt;@^^[[footnote]] All stories are little lies. — //L.S.//[[/footnote]]^^,@&lt; &gt;@^^[[footnote]] Were they here, you might have drawn the Courts ire with that statement. — //Andvari//[[/footnote]]^^,@&lt; &gt;@^^[[footnote]]That makes me doubt them more, not less, my dear. — //L.S.// [[/footnote]]
— **##purple|Lavender##**

//It is clear that Andvari&#39;s words are biased as he profits from the current state of affairs, [[footnote]] Can&#39;t deny that. — //Andvari//[[/footnote]] but I will not trust a word that **##purple|Lavender##** has uttered. Do you not know that she is one of those responsible for [[[sc-05-321-05-335|the recent slaughter and burning]]] of the **##green|near dead woods of the Fae##**? [[footnote]] Do her actions turn her words into lies?  — //L.S.// [[/footnote]] Not to speak of how ridiculous her story was even by our standards. I worry about what she might do if allowed to stay here longer.//[[footnote]]Well, the Court vanished around the time Normalcy was declared. It&#39;s being kept from here by a huge lie. Seems pretty obvious what she wants. — //Andvari//[[/footnote]]^^,@&lt; &gt;@^^[[footnote]] Something that just so happens to align with our usual M.O. — //L.S.// [[/footnote]]
 — Hannah

//From what we know, Truth Glamour must adhere to one of these two options: It accurately reflects &#34;objective truth&#34; and the Court is as among gods, immutable and out of reach. Alternatively, the Court is much closer to us and spells of truehood are something achievable by mortal hands. I have my doubts something could ever really work with &#34;objective truth&#34;, as subjective as each of our experiences is. So I am inclined to think that the search for a replacement glamour is not a futile task.//
