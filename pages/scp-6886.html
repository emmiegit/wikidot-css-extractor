As a Ticonderoga-class[[footnote]] Item cannot be contained but does not need to be contained.[[/footnote]] anomaly, SCP-6886 currently requires no unique special containment procedures.
MTF Mu-6 &#34;Children of Eden&#34; has been assigned to monitor SCP-6886 and its related phenomena. Any notable changes in activity or behavior shall be reported immediately. Staff without level 5 clearance are barred from establishing communication with the entity known as //Mu-6//, any attempts by the entity to do so shall be ignored and reported.

In case that the Cultural Corruption Index index of humanity approaches 85% the Exodus protocol shall be activated.

[[size 150%]]**__Description__**[[/size]]
[[/=]]

SCP-6886 itself refers to an ecumenopolis[[footnote]] Concept describing a planet covered by a city that spans the entire surface. [[/footnote]], roughly 1.6 Earth radii, which serves as the origin of several related anomalous phenomena.



The formal name of SCP-6886 is //Central Providence//, however many of its inhabitants simply use the term //Providence// for brevity. Other common terms used when describing SCP-6886 include //Home//, //Salvation//, //Sanctuary// and //Quarantine Sector Zero//. 

Extensive descriptions of SCP-6886 and anomalies derived from it can be found in addendum SCP-6886.2. 
Of note in particular is the entity designated //Mu-6//, an advanced artificial intelligence which acts as the leader of SCP-6886 and the entities that reside on the planet. Residents of SCP-6886 usually refer to //Mu-6// with the term //Mother//. 

Despite the self-suppressing, highly cooperative and amicable nature of //Mu-6// and SCP-6886 related anomalies, their scale makes them impossible to fully contain. Per 05-5 request, it is recommended to read discovery addendum SCP-6886.1 which supplies further context and perspective on containment.

On april 17, 1912 an unknown object manifested within the office of O5-5. The object was described as a white glossy cube, 60 cm in height, which could project images on its surface and produce speech.[[footnote]] Later identified as an SCP-6886-2 instance.[[/footnote]] Following lockdown and analysis the object was deemed not an immediate threat and contained.  On several occasions the object politely requested having an audience with the O5 council. It provided no resistance when its requests were denied. After extensive experimentation the object was not found to cause any negative effects on saff who interacted with it. Following this, O5-5 herself requested to speak with the object.

And that is all. You may be wondering, //what is the importance of this addendum within the file?// That is the second question you probably asked after //why is this SCP being given such low containment priority?// Or //why is this the 05 taking such a lax stance towards this anomaly?//
@@ @@
It&#39;s been over a hundred years and the information we have gathered on SCP-6886 should terrify us. Many of you think we should be scrambling to find a way to neutralize it. Or at least find a way to conceal ourselves from it. I’ve heard some of the younger staff dramatically exclaim that this SCP should be designated as Tiamat or even Apollyon.
@@ @@
There are in fact two reasons why we haven&#39;t done any of that. The first simple, the second more complex and rather philosophical in nature. I shall begin with the easy part. 
@@ @@
As all staff worried about this file are quick to point out we have known about this anomaly since the tail end of the second industrial revolution. They also claim we have done nothing significant about it yet. If you have spent any time reading the historical records of this file you would know that is very much not true. We were concerned at first, very concerned. An unknown object appeared inside my office and when I opened that door I  was sure for a moment my consciousness was about to be obliterated by some cognitohazard. Or maybe it was just going to shoot me. Instead, I was treated to a single polite exclamation.

//Greetings from Central Providence.//

@@ @@
The following six years we tried every test we could think of, yet all signs pointed to it simply being a mechanical drone with communication abilities. An ambassador.
@@ @@
It could render itself indestructible, but it never retaliated after our attempts that proved it indestructible. I observed many of these tests. It just floated, static, glowing. Many colorful lights under its surface. There was something oddly captivating about the object. Eventually I realized, as I looked upon it, that I felt a strange sense of calm every time I did. Serenity. Purity. 
@@ @@
Our next test after that was for memetic hazards, of course. Nothing. It was simply a part of its identity.
@@ @@
I eventually requested to speak with the object. Needless to say it explained a lot of things, too many to write here. //Mother// -an overt name perhaps, but the only accurate translation- said we had an important choice to make. And by we I mean humanity as a whole. It had been studying our planet for eons, before we even discovered fire. Before our predecessors walked the surface. Before the cities of our great civilizations were erected between the rivers. 
@@ @@
The whole time //Mother// hoped we never began to slide down that slippery slope so many before us have. Of course, we did. It was a matter of time. When the spreading corruption in humanity could no longer be ignored there was no choice but to move onto the next step.
@@ @@
Given the volatile nature of the world at the time //Mother// deemed us, the Foundation, the best representatives for humanity. As such, according to its non-intervention protocol, we were to be contacted first. 
@@ @@
And that non-intervention policy, it is thorough. We asked it to continue concealing itself from humanity at large and it did, we asked for more time to decide and it allowed us plenty more. //Mother// was concerned with our current tendency, but it also said we still had time before a definitive decision could no longer be delayed. 
@@ @@
Yes. There is the one notable exception to the non-intervention policy. But honestly I can not in good faith deem it unjustifiable, and I know several of the O5 agree with me.
@@ @@
It has been over a hundred years, in that time we have learnt that the forces inhabiting SCP-6886 could snap us out of existence at any moment. They could do it now, and they could have done so over a hundred years ago. And yet they have not. Instead all we have ever received from them is cooperation and communication. The power of this anomaly, while awe-inspiring and terrifying, is not the fascinating part about it.
@@ @@
I can understand your concerns, the idea that something that has many times the power of humanity is not actively attempting to subjugate us is hard to process. But that says more about us than it does about them. Being fully honest, the team we have designated to monitor SCP-6886 activities in case Mother may be deceiving us is functionally obsolete. //Mother// is not going to change, but maybe we can.
@@ @@
The second reason, well that is a bit harder to explain. And in a way I do not believe I should explain it. Suffice to say, if you cannot fathom any way to deal with SCP-6886 other than hostile or defensive actions, then you may be part of the bigger problem.

[[tab SCP-6886]]
SCP-6886 itself is a rocky planet which orbits an A-type main-sequence star, the single planet in the system. The  exact location of SCP-6886 is yet to be determined but it is known to exist beyond the edge of the visible universe.[[footnote]] From the perspective of Earth. [[/footnote]] Orbital scanning reveals 62% of the surface is covered by land and 38% by bodies of water and ice caps.


Analysis of the land shows that 74%  is covered in urbanization of some type, with the remaining 26% used for green spaces. Many of these are comparable to urban parks on Earth while some others are much bigger and seemingly more comparable to artificial nature reserves. 

Defined urban planning guidelines can be seen uniformly applied through the entire planet-wide city. A minor portion of the urbanization is characterized by dense circular city sections dominated by skyscrapers. It is believed that these areas constitute a mix of residential development, leisure complexes and places of cultural diffusion.

The rest of the urbanization on the planet is characterized by arcologies[[footnote]] Concept describing massive structures meant to comfortably house high amounts of residents while having a minor impact on the environment. [[/footnote]] that are heavily interconnected to each other and to the circular city portions by highly developed public transport.. These arcologies can be found all over the surface including floating over the oceans, at the top of the ice caps or hanging from cliff walls.


Despite the level of urbanization, vegetation is easily discernible in all areas of the planet where the climate allows for it, including the dense circular city center portions. No areas dedicated to industrial or economic purposes have been detected.

Further documentation of SCP-6886 is limited due to the presence of the planetary shield[[footnote]] In this case the term shield refers to a spherical energy projection. [[/footnote]] encompassing the entire celestial body approximately 40 km above the surface. The nature of this planetary shield (henceforth designated SCP-6886-1) is not well understood, however its effects are clear. SCP-6886-1 makes it impossible for matter or energy of any kind to travel outside of itself in any way, including teleportation, dimensional offsetting and even temporal dissonance. Photons are therefore incapable of traversing through SCP-6886-1, which makes the nature of the visible surface unknown. It is theorized that SCP-6886-1 effectively detaches all the contents inside it from base reality, however, it allows for travel to any other location in the universe contained within other SCP-6886-1 instances. Therefore, other planets enclosed by SCP-6886-1 instances are commonly referred to as being part of the //Network//.

[[include component:image-block name=Shield.png|align=center|width=100%|caption= SCP-6886-1]]

Due to the presence of the SCP-6886-1 no foundation personnel have been able to document SCP-6886 themselves. Autonomous drones (henceforth designated SCP-6886-2 instances) are capable of relaying messages from the inhabitants of SCP-6886. The following is a message relayed from an inhabitant of SCP-6886 further referred to as POI-3137. It is meant to primarily showcase the ideological stance of entities residing within SCP-6886 rather than describe the planet with further detail.

Secondary Sanctuary Planets (designated SCP-6886-A), are one type of planet which are enclosed in 
SCP-6886-1 instances. They are therefore referred to as being part of the //Network//. 

To date twelve SCP-6886-A instances have been detected within 200 light years from earth, however data provided by //Mother// claims there are over 35 trillion SCP-6886-A instances in the //Network//. 

Known SCP-6886-A instances display common characteristics, these include the following.[[footnote]] As able to be studied given the obstructions caused by the shields. [[/footnote]]

* All planets display a diverse biosphere. Ranges vary greatly, with some being less diverse than earth while others are vastly more diverse. Many have a similar diversity to Earth.

* All planets display a complete lack of habitation by any sentient species in any form that could be considered an organized civilization.

* All planets are patrolled by a large number of SCP-6886-2 instances both outside and inside the shield. They are usually referred to as //Archivists//, //Observers// or //Cleaners// by the inhabitants of SCP-6886.

* All planets display evidence of prior habitation and development by advanced civilizations. All artificial structures on the planets have been allowed to deteriorate naturally through lack of maintenance. The amount of deterioration varies, with some displaying years to decades of minor deterioration while others show little evidence of urbanization left.

* The one exception to the previous point are specific sections within urban centers or specific structures which have been maintained with great care by the SCP-6886-2 instances. These exceptions vary greatly in size and sophistication but many appear to be of cultural significance.

* All planets display varying degrees of exploitation of natural resources and damage to former ecosystems which are in the progress of being repaired by nature. Some display minor damage which has been mostly repaired, others display massive damage such as open air mines, heavily polluted areas or expansive and aggressive urbanization.

The following is an interview between Dr. Hannah Carter and POI-3137 regarding sanctuary planets.
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px&#34;]]
**Interviewer:** Dr. Hannah Carter

[[/=]]

//A small SCP-6886-3 instance floats two meters above the floor. A holographic projection is being produced by the instance. The silhouette is flat and hard to discern, however it is known to be a large athropodal lifeform with eight limbs.// 

**Dr. Carter:** Welcome.

**POI-3137:** Greetings from Central Providence. 

**Dr. Carter:** Thank you. Now, I understand you were previously informed about the purpose of this interview. Am I right?

**POI-3137:** Yes, Mother has informed me. The secondary sanctuary planets, we are to speak of them.

**Dr. Carter:** Secondary, right. I&#39;ll be referring to them as SCP-6886-A from now on.

**POI-3137:** As you desire.

**Dr. Carter:** Good. First, in your own words, can you elaborate on the purpose of the SCP-6886-A instances?

**POI-3137:** Purpose seems like an inappropriate word. The planets have no purpose, they just are. They are and therefore they are beautiful.

Random chance states some planets are temperate enough to produce lifeforms, and so lifeforms are. They are and therefore they are beautiful. 

The shields however, the shields have purpose. The shields protect the planets. The shields protect the lifeforms. The shields protect our history. 

**Dr. Carter:** Can you elaborate what you mean by your history?

**POI-3137:** History. Legacy. Music. Too many meanings, hard to reduce into a single word. The shield, Mother, the Archivists, they keep the kind parts of our history alive. They let the unkind parts of our history rot. The diseased parts, so the green can return.

**Dr. Carter:** The green? 

**POI-3137:** I believe I used the word yellow-blue before.

**Dr. Carter:** I see you’ve been expanding your knowledge of english.

**POI-3137:** I have exercised. No. I have studied. For ease of the communication transformation.
 
**Dr. Carter:** That is appreciated. Now, I&#39;d like to ask you about something more specific, what you call your old home.

**POI-3137:** Old homeworld, yes. Now secondary sanctuary.

**Dr. Carter:** So, that specific SCP-6886-A instance is the planet in which your species originated?

**POI-3137:** Affirmative. 

**Dr. Carter:** And your species left it in order to live in SCP-6886 instead?

**POI-3137:** Affirmative.

**Dr. Carter:** Why?

**POI-3137:** Mother contacted us over three hundred orbits ago. Mother was kind, she communicated with us. We were all fascinated by her words. But we were also afraid.

Mother said we were diseased. She said the disease was mild, but that with enough orbits it could metastasize. Mother said our species was likely to make our own medicine, to quarantine ourselves. She said one day our type could fly between suns and study the fantasy of the universe. Despite that, we still had the choice for quarantine if we asked for it. 

And so, sixty seven orbits ago we decided to accept quarantine. We saw no reason to fly between the stars without purpose. We saw no reason for progress without purpose. Mother accepted us, and said we could still fly between the stars  in a different configuration. The way I currently am. 

**Dr. Carter:** I find that hard to understand, are you not bothered to be a prisoner in SCP-6886?

**POI-3137:** Not a prisoner. Our material form is not allowed to travel outside the shields, but the Observers allow us endless freedom. We are free to watch without causing any injury. We prefer to watch the secondary sanctuary planets as they have been blessed by Mother already. On special occasions Mother allows our material forms to travel the Network, so we can sense the beauty of life with all glory. 

**Dr. Carter:** I understand. I believe that will be all for now. 

**POI-3137:** Please, do not excise yourself from this conversation yet.

**Dr. Carter:** Excuse me?

**POI-3137:** I would experience joy if you allowed me to ask some questions about the ground.

//Dr. Carter stares at POI-3137 for a couple seconds, confused.// 

**Dr. Carter:** Umm, alright. What do you mean by ground?

**POI-3137:** Your home.

**Dr. Carter:** Earth?

**POI-3137:** That is the correct word indeed. 

**Dr. Carter:** You have already read about Earth, have you not?

**POI-3137:** I have, but I am searching for something more… Small? Unique?

**Dr. Carter:** Specific?

**POI-3137:** That is the correct word indeed. 

**Dr. Carter:** You want to learn more about where I live?

**POI-3137:** I would like to learn about where you were born, where you developed into your current form. 

**Dr. Carter:** Where I grew up? 

**POI-3137:** Yes.

**Dr. Carter:** Well, I, I don&#39;t have much to say. Grew up in a forgotten portion of this country, the rust belt they call it. Just a strip of decaying urbanization and injustice. The powerful came, took all, then left. Today some claim to repair the damage but their words don&#39;t mean much to me. I prefer not to think about where I grew up. All I can say is the entire time I lived there all I aspired to was to go away.

**POI-3137:** Have you no love for your specific home?

**Dr. Carter:** I-

//Dr. Carter looks away, towards the wall. She pauses before looking back at POI-3137.//

**Dr. Carter:** Not really. My dad did his best, alone, but there wasn&#39;t much his best could do. 

//Dr. Carter pauses, she partially covers her mouth for a moment. She then crosses her arms, her expression visibly more serious.//

**Dr. Carter:** Doesn&#39;t matter, he can&#39;t hear this now.


**POI-3137:** That is most unfortunate.  I believe there is value in your specific home, even if your memory of it is injured.

**Dr. Carter:** I disagree.

**POI-3137:** That is understandable. I experienced that same feeling many orbits ago. Maybe one day your experience will change.

//Dr. Carter loosens her pose, her expression turning to one of sorrow.//

**Dr. Carter:** Maybe.

**Afterword:**POI-3137 has echoed the same information we already have on SCP-6886, nothing new to report. I would like to note, however, that speaking with it is often calming. It is also hard to remain clinical when speaking with it. I can understand the sensations that O5-5 described. I could say it sucked too much information out of me but it somehow felt organic. It is still my nature to try and find the lies in every statement the entity has to say but so far my even my own gut is telling me it is time to let my guard down.

Secondary Quarantine Planets (designated SCP-6886-B), are one type of planet which are enclosed in SCP-6886-1 instances. Although they are referred to as being nominally part of the //Network//, these appear to be isolated within it. Inhabitants of SCP-6886 claim this is because the inhabitants in SCP-6886-B instances have chosen so. 

To date, five SCP-6886-B instances have been detected within 200 light years from earth, however data provided by mother claims there are over 7 trillion SCP-6886-B instances in the Network. 

Known SCP-6886-B instances display common characteristics, these include the following.[[footnote]] As able to be studied given the obstructions caused by the shields. [[/footnote]]

* All planets display the presence of advanced civilizations, with significantly high populations.

* All planets display vast urbanization and exploitation of natural resources, to the point where the biosphere is close to or has fully collapsed. 

* All planets display extensive pollution in water, ground and air. 

* All planets are patrolled by a small number of SCP-6886-2 instances. These stay outside the shield at all times.

* All planets display varying degrees of urban decay and conflict occurring all throughout the surface. 

Statement on SCP-6886-2 from current lead researcher Dr. Hannah Carter. Added on March 08, 2020.

Secondary Quarantine Planets are one of the connected aspects to SCP-6886 which we know the least about. This is not necessarily because our information sources won&#39;t talk about them, they do if we are persistent enough. But they themselves admit preferring not to. They don&#39;t like thinking about what happens inside SCP-6886-A instances, POI-3137 included.
@@ @@
They claim the people in those planets were contacted with plenty of time in advance. They claim the people of those planets were less responsive, or became less responsive over time. They claim the disease took over their entire populations. The ones who were not infected were slowly eradicated, assimilated or indoctrinated into a single ideology. Until no matter how much //Mu-6// pleaded to them, they did not reply. Until there was no choice but to force the quarantine on them.
@@ @@
With no way out and with their nature taking over, they ravaged and pillaged any trace of life left in their home worlds until everything left was artificial or dead.

//Mu-6// claims they would have done so anyways, they were too far gone. They would have dried their home planets down to their rotten core. Until they had no choice but to jump to the next planet, and then the next, and the next. And that is why quarantine is necessary, according to them.
@@ @@
It is hard not to agree. Some of these planets had files about them in our database, we knew about the danger of the people walking upon their surfaces. They are now neutralized, soon to be forgotten.

If I may drop the scientific tone for a moment, as if I haven&#39;t already above, there is one thing I’d like to emphasize. 
@@ @@
Whatever aura of serenity that most SCP-6886 related phonema display, SCP-6886-B are the one exception. Staring at the pictures our satellites have taken of such planets makes you feel a palpable sense of dread. Of hopelessness. Of familiarity. In their rotten surfaces I see echoes of the decay and rust I used to know. Steam, oil and smoke. They are a filthy mirror.

The following is an interview between researcher Dr. Hannah Carter and POI-3137 discussing daily life in SCP-6886. Extraneous dialogue removed.

//A small SCP-6886-2 instance floats two meters above the floor. A holographic projection is being produced by the instance. The silhouette is identical to that in previous logs.// 

**POI-3137:** And that is how I spend most of my days in Providence. Reading under the endless sky blue, feeling the breeze caress my hairs, the sun reflecting upon my chitin. The presence of friends does make it far better. I tell them about my passion for knowledge, they tell me about their own passions. All of us are free. No judgement, no expectations. Pure joy. 

**Dr. Carter:** Well, that was a lot. When I asked you to be ready with a journal of your average day I wasn&#39;t expecting you would even add a small romantic summary at the end.

**POI-3137:** I am sorry, was I inappropriate?

**Dr. Carter:** No not at all. If anything my one complaint is you forgot to mention how much time you  practice english daily. You have clearly improved even more. 

**POI-3137:** Thank you. I am glad to please.

//Dr. Carter laughs shortly//

**Dr. Carter:** It is hard to remain professional while talking with you. 

**POI-3137:** I am sorry.

**Dr. Carter:** Don&#39;t be. Anyways, it is still very hard for me to process though. Don&#39;t you ever aspire for more than what Providence provides?

**POI-3137:** What more could there be?

**Dr. Carter:** I don&#39;t know. Anything. Start a business, invent a new technology, hell, discover a new continent. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just running my mouth but I mean, really, nothing?

**POI-3137:** You know Mother does not limit our activities unless they are tainted by the disease. And in providence, we are not tainted by the disease. No more. 

**Dr. Carter:** Yes you’ve said that but what does that even mean to you?

**POI-3137:** We act on love, we act on kindness, we act on empathy. We do not act for the sake of the act. As Mother says, there is no progress without purpose.

Progress for the sake of progress is the biggest lie. The disease whispers it in the ears of the damned. Progress without purpose is empty, it is meaningless, it is cancer. The infected go mad, they claim the next invention will be the one that justifies all the evil in the past. It will be the one that saves them from paying for the evil they have committed themselves. Some do believe the lie. Others only echoe the lie because they think they are the few who will survive the end. They are wrong.

They will keep going until there is nothing left to invent, until there is no one left to invent for. Until they can no longer run from their sins, and they catch up to them. If their own greed does not destroy them, then the realization of their own nature will be enough to make them neutralize themselves. 

**Dr. Carter:** I understand part of what you are trying to say. But, purpose? I Still find it hard to understand what the purpose of living a life such as yours would be. 

**POI-3137:** Could you be more specific?

**Dr. Carter:** Right, right. For example, why are you putting so much effort into learning about us? What do you even gain given the perfect life you seemingly live? 

**POI:** I study beautiful things. I thought you studied beautiful things as well. 

**Dr. Carter:** I... I suppose I do.

**Afterword:** What are we even doing. I know I’ll be reprimanded for this when they start revising the file but, fuck. What is the point?

Does it matter? I have nothing left to protect anyways.

[[tab Technology in SCP-6886]]
Many advanced technologies are believed to originate from SCP-6886. Most have only been documented in anecdotal evidence provided by inhabitants of SCP-6886. Only a minor portion of these technologies are believed to be anomalous, including planned non-euclidean architecture and matter replication.

Under the context of containment, the most notorious technology that originates from SCP-6886 are autonomous mechanical drones henceforth designated SCP-6886-2 instances. These vary greatly in size, shape and purpose, however all share the following anomalous characteristics:

* Instances are capable of using antimemetic cloaking technology to render themselves invisible to all sentient life.

* Instances are capable of material translocation by the way of spatial jumps. They are capable of translocating approximately 10 light years in a single jump, with recharging taking around 15 hours.
 
* Instances are capable of generating small SCP-6886-1 instances no bigger than 2m in diameter. SCP-6886-2 instances use this ability in order to traverse through SCP-6886-1 instances via osmosis.

Beyond this, instances display at least one more ability some of which are anomalous. This may include the ability to project holographic images, carry heavy loads using tractor beams or scanning and analysing lifeforms. No instances with any strictly offensive abilities have been found. 

//Mu-6// has allowed limited reverse engineering of two of these technologies. The antimemetic cloaking technology is the base for the generation seven Absolute Exclusionary Harness prototypes. Meanwhile the spatial jump technology has been used in the development of generation four deep space reconnaissance probes.

SCP-6886-1 technology has however not been studied and //Mu-6// has been reluctant to divulge any information on it. According to it this action could constitute a breach of the //Network//.

During early interactions with SCP-6886-2 instances no information on the SCP-6886-1 generators could be gathered. Instances activate their shields if they perceive being in danger which effectively makes them impossible to interact with in any way. 

It is of note how the spatial jump and shield technologies synergize with each other to allow for quicker transportation. While inside SCP-6886-1 instances, SCP-6886-2 are capable of spatially jumping to other locations within the //Network// even if they are further away than 10 light years. This lends further credence to the theory that the space within SCP-6886-1 instances is detached from base reality and distances within are significantly shorter.[[footnote]] Foundation probes were transported to orbit around SCP-6886 by SCP-6886-2 instances via this method. [[/footnote]]

//Mu-6// itself has not been found to be anomalous in any way. Despite the massive amounts of information she is presumed to process, the actual dimensions of the hardware housing it within SCP-6886 are virtually infinite.

The following is an example of a message sent by //Mu-6// describing its own nature.

On June 08, 2021 Dr. Hannah Carter was declared missing after not being able to be located for three days. The only evidence of her whereabouts was recorded by the security camera in interrogation room 24 at site-49. The camera itself had been tampered with, its vision was partially obstructed by a piece of cloth.

//A sliver of the interrogation room floor can be seen to the right of the frame. The rest is covered by cloth which darkens the image. Towards the top right corner a magenta light can be seen glowing faintly through the cloth.// 

**Dr. Carter:** So, what happens when the others… when they get to that point.

**POI-3137:** There is no guarantee your kind wi-

**Dr. Carter:** I know! I… I know. But, tell me Arellan, what happens if they do. 

**POI-3137:** You know Mother. The choice of how the transition shall occur is up to your kind, that is, unless your kind rejects reason. I know your foundation will not allow that to happen. They shall allow the exodus to begin if they deem it necessary.

**Dr. Carter:** Right right, fuck you had told me that already before. 

//Dr. Carter laughs nervously.//

**POI-3137:** Something bothers you.

**Dr. Carter:** I… yes. I have one more question.

**POI-3137:** Ask.

**Dr. Carter:** What happens after?

**POI-3137:** After we are gone?

**Dr. Carter:** Yes... but more than that. What happens after… everything. What even is our legacy?

**POI-3137:** When the stars have died and skies have grown dark. When black holes fade and every molecule has been torn apart. When the network fails and the last bastions of our legacy dissolve into nothing. Then, at the center of all that ever was or will be, Providence shall remain.

**Dr. Carter:** What&#39;s the point though? What does it even matter if everything else will be dead, what purpose will we even have then.

**POI-3137:** Once we have forgotten time itself, we shall remain. Singing our songs. Dancing our dances. All wondering in unison if any of it was ever worth it. 

//Dr. Carter laughs sarcastically.//

**Dr. Carter:** Well, that&#39;s bleak as hell.

**POI-3137:** That&#39;s the thing, I think all of us will agree. For all the damage and destruction we may have caused, our songs, our stories and our lives were worth it. 

**Dr. Carter:** I see…

**POI-3137:** Are you ready?

**Dr. Carter:** I think so.

//At this point an intense colorful light can be discerned glowing through the cloth, at the same location where the magenta light formerly was. Staff who have witnessed the video have reported a hypnotic quality to the light. A monotone voice can be heard.// 

**Mother:** Come, life awaits.

**Dr Carter:** Thank you, Mother.

//The light grows in intensity for three seconds, which causes the recording to begin distorting. The video suddenly cuts to black.//
