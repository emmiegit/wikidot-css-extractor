**Item #:** 805-SCP

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** 805-SCP is to be kept under typical surveillance and contained in an enclosure created on-site. Any members of the public residing in proximity to 805-SCP are to be administered amnestics in the event that visual contact with 805-SCP-1 occurs.

**Description:** 805-SCP is an anomalous bus stop. While anomalous properties have not been documented, reports of seeing a bus (classified as 805-SCP-1) appear and disappear from 805-SCP prior to containment are numerous in the city where 805-SCP resides. 805-SCP also contains a series of number and letters written all over it which have been deciphered (See Addendum #1).

**Addendum #1:** The series of number and letters located on 805-SCP was decoded, providing access to a hidden document inexplicably stored within the Foundation&#39;s database.

&gt; __{{DAY 1}}__
&gt; 
&gt; I find myself shaking, freezing cold on an empty bus taking me wherever. The bus stops, yet I do not see where. My cold breath appears on the tinted glass as I anticipate the added presence of strangers on the bus. A tall, thin figure with a dark cloud surrounding what I presume to be its head enters, crouched over and holding a brown paper bag. It sits two rows ahead of me and sits quietly taking objects out of the bag as the bus moves on.
&gt; 
&gt; I am hungry and dehydrated. My watch says only 10 minutes have passed but I know it must be longer. My eyelids start closing. I try fight it by pinching my arm. I pinch too hard and let out a wince. //Stupid.// The figure turns to look at me, its face nearly discernible as the fog starts to dissipate.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Are you okay, little one?&#34; its sparse, chilling voice echoes around the bus. I look away, subtly crouching behind the seat in front of me.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Are you alone? Do you need any help?&#34; I hear it get up from its seat and move towards me. My heart pounding in my ears, I muster the courage to say &#34;I&#39;m fine, thank you.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Are you sure? You appear to be in need of some assistance, no? Perhaps you would like a piece of this wonderful //(mumble)//&#34; I don&#39;t understand what the last thing it said was, but I doubt it would have made me feel any better about this situation.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Don&#39;t worry about me, I am just about to head off.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Oh, isn&#39;t that unfortunate? Are you sure you don&#39;t just want a nibble?&#34; It gestures to me holding a mushy grey sphere. I shake my head and try to walk past it to the front of the bus. It steps in my way and asks again.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Just a nibble?&#34; I push the creature into the seats on my left and bolt towards the driver.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Excuse me, could I please get off here?&#34; The driver looks at me with a confused look.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Uh...sure, I guess.&#34; The bus comes to a halt and I walk through the doors, not looking behind me and running off as far from the bus as I can. I am immediately stopped by the place I find myself in.
&gt; 
&gt; A grand city with a massive billboard reading &#34;Join the GCE today to achieve true ascension!&#34; branded with a symbol of a key with arrows protruding from its teeth. The bus has already left, and fortunately with the creature still on it. An old brown car stops right in front of me, how it suddenly appeared I have no clue. A humanoid with green skin exits the vehicle and holds out a necklace with a key attached to it.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Here,&#34; a deep, confident voice emerges from the creature, &#34;Take this and join us on our quest for enlightenment!&#34; I stare at the necklace for a few seconds and weigh up my options. I have nowhere else to go and no means to return back to my likely now obliterated home so I decide to play along.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Thank you! May I join you in the car?&#34; I ask taking the key-bearing necklace.
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;Put the amulet on first, then you will already be halfway there.&#34; A wave of confusion goes over me, but I shrug it off and put the &#39;amulet&#39; around my neck. I suddenly start to feel dizzy and see bright lights. Before I can realise what is happening, I am somewhere else. Sitting on a bed in a cosy room with this book on my lap and a pen in hand. The first page reads Day 1 and I am compelled to write down what I have just experienced. I&#39;m now heading to bed, hopefully tomorrow I can get more answers.
