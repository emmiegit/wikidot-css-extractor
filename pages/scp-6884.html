**Special Containment Procedures:** Reports of abnormally large black felines, canids or other similar fauna roaming the British Isles are to be investigated by Foundation agents integrated into local law enforcement. Following confirmation of SCP-6884-related origin, Mobile Task Force Gamma-4 (“Whistle In The Woods”) are to be dispatched in an attempt to terminate or capture the wild instance for long term housing and study at [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-44 |Site-44]]]’s Cryptozoological Research Wing.

 In the event that the sighted instance is unable to be located, seismic imaging should be utilised to locate any unnaturally occurring cave systems in the region. Upon discovery, Mobile Task Force Zeta-9 (“Mole Rats”) are to enter these caverns in order to pursue the fleeing SCP-6884 instance or uncover an SCP-6884 brood.

**Description:** SCP-6884 is an unidentified subterranean species of mammal bearing resemblance to members of the genus //Panthera// [[footnote]] Colloquially known as big cats. [[/footnote]] while possessing some characteristics of the //Caniformia// [[footnote]] An order containing dogs, wolves and foxes. [[/footnote]] suborder. 

The species’ primary anomalous quality is the ability to forcibly create caverns and fissures in rock, often resulting in lengthy passageways and cave systems with which to reside within and raise young. This capability appears to necessitate a significant amount of energy from SCP-6884 and hence is used sparingly, usually as a flight response. It is believed that SCP-6884 instances spend around half of their life within caves, emerging only to hunt during nocturnal hours; a lifestyle likely responsible for their primarily black colouration. Once on the surface, instances are likely to consume sheep or infant cattle alongside collecting resources to construct elaborate dens. Predation upon human subjects remains incredibly rare, with only 3 reported attacks since 1990.

SCP-6884’s population size is undetermined, though is believed to comprise of at least 150 individual members spread across Britain. While the species remains at large, their low frequency, generally elusive nature and the ease of public containment efforts has resulted in a Euclid classification level as opposed to other alternatives. [[footnote]] Now pending reclassification following Incident 6884-Alpha. [[/footnote]]

**History &amp; Folkloric Significance:**
Encounters with large cats in Britain date back to around 1,000BC, whereby Celtic warriors and farmers shared tales of supposed battles with SCP-6884 broods that would steal young rams from their flocks. Over time, Celtic inhabitation of the British Isles saw a purging of the species’ numbers due to their threat posed to livestock and may be the reason for development of their reclusive nature.

In the modern era, the majority of surviving instances are situated in the South of England, with 676 reported sightings in the county of Devon between 2004 and 2005. SCP-6884 is most commonly known for its heavy presence in Bodmin Moor, Dartmoor, Exmoor and Mossmoor respectively; this distribution has been attributed to the aforementioned areas’ limestone-based rock composition which is softer and hence easier to manipulate than typical stone while maintaining the integrity to support lengthy cave systems. Public belief of SCP-6884 is widespread in their inhabited areas, though due to the species’ outwardly non-anomalous nature and tendency to flee once sighted, this has not been deemed a threat to secrecy or the Veil at large. 

**Addendum 6884.1:** Investigation 
Although the Foundation suspected the presence of an anomalous big cat species in Britain since the 1970s due to their heavy presence in local culture, SCP-6884’s existence was only proved in late 2011 in an investigation prompted by the Cryptozoology Division. Following approval, a pair of Site-44 agents were dispatched to assess the validity of claims surrounding SCP-6884. The results of the investigation can be found in the following: 

[[collapsible show=&#34;POI Interview 6884 “Alpha”&#34; hide=&#34;Hide&#34;]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Date:** 20/05/2011

**Location:** The Black Ram Pub, Mossmoor, Somerset

**Interviewed:** POI-6884-1, Chris P. Fisher (Local Farmer)

**Interviewer(s):** Agent Carter &amp; Operative Johnson

**Foreword:** The following interview as conducted in-person at The Black Ram, a popular local pub and inn. Unaware of the proceeding conversation prior, A. Carter and O. Johnson had been tracking Mr Fisher for weeks prior in the belief that he had encountered an SCP-6884 in his past.

----

**[BEGIN LOG]**

//Mr Fisher is sat at a table at the edge of the bar, alone, staring at a collection of photos on the wall. Carter and Johnson enter equipped with convert audio recording equipment.//

**A. Carter:** Hi! Are you Chris? 

**POI-6884-1:** Uh, yeah. Do you need something?

**A. Carter:** Only if you’re free at the moment.

**POI-6884-1:** I’m free. 

**A. Carter:** Great. Me and my associate are currently working on the production of a documentary surrounding British legends and folklore. We’ve been speaking to some locals and, well, we were wondering if you’d help us with any insight into a local cryptid story?

//POI-6884-1 remains silent for several seconds.//

**POI-6884-1:** Um, sure. What exactly is it that you’re interested in?

**A. Carter:** We’re researching rumours of a… unique species of panther in England.

//POI-6884-1 again falls silent, seemingly in thought.//

**POI-6884-1:** Who told you to come to me about this?

**O. Johnson:** That’s irrelevant. Many eye witness reports claim to sight the creatures, only to seemingly disappear when visual contact is lost — even for a moment.

**A. Carter:** I wouldn’t expect any payment if you won’t talk.

//Agent Carter gestures to a briefcase.//

**POI-6884-1:** Fine. (//Heavily sighs//) It was 3 years ago, I’d just gone to Mossmoor market to pick up some animal feed, new equipment, stuff like that. I was in my pickup truck heading back to the farm and it was late evening so visibility wasn’t great but wasn’t terrible. To get back to my farm I had to drive along some rural roads, past the moorland just south of here, and I’d just turned off when I looked to my left.

It was right there; out on the moor. Clear as days. A gigantic… black animal in the distance. (//Stutters//) I had no idea what I was seeing. It didn’t even move, just watched my truck. I looked at it and… it looked back at me with… those luminous yellow eyes. I sat there utterly dumbfounded, or terrified, until I passed a hedgerow and when I looked back it’d gone in an instant. (//Sighs//) I stopped the truck and walked to the spot where it was. Saw a trail of footprints leading to that area, but nothing leading away. Don’t think I left my property for weeks after that.

**A. Carter:** Intriguing. Have you had any other encounters with big cats?

**POI-6884-1:** Oh, (//Chuckles//) I wouldn’t call it a cat. It’s body was feline, yes, but it’s head was more like that of a dog’s — and it’s eyes were… something else entirely.

**A. Carter:** If you don’t mind me asking, wh-

**POI-6884-1:** (//Trembling slightly//) I don’t want to talk anymore. You wanted me to tell you everything I know, and there it was.

//They sit in silence for one minute before POI-6884-1 speaks.//

**POI-6884-1:** (//Points at a collection of photos on the wall//) You see that? Second from the left. Look closer at the hedgerow. 

//The photograph depicts an expansive pasture in Devon, surrounded by light woodland. A dark shape is visible bordering the farthest hedgerow.//

**POI-6884-1:** That image was taken by Charles Wilford in 1998. He lives near Dartmoor National Park. If you want more information, I suggest you speak to him.

**A. Carter:** Thank you for your cooperation, Mr Fisher.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Date:** 25/05/2011

**Location:** Wilford Manor, Dartmoor, Devon

**Interviewed:** POI-6884-2, Charles Wilford 

**Interviewer(s):** Agent Carter &amp; Operative Johnson

**Foreword:** The following interview was conducted at the personal estate of Charles Wilford due to belief that he had experience with SCP-6884 formerly.

----

**[BEGIN LOG]**

(//Agent Carter rings the estate’s doorbell//)

**O. Johnson:** How old is this guy?

**A. Carter:** 67.

**O. Johnson:** (//Gesturing to the manor//) Where’d he make his fortune?

**A. Carter:** Officially, sailing and eventually the boat manufacturing industry according to the Foundation’s database, but we suspect some exploitation of offshore bank accounts in his younger years.

**O. Johnson:** I see. No one checked up on it?

**A. Carter:** No, we need to keep good relations with this guy. He’s useful for sourcing information and resources for the Naval Divisio-

//The front door opens, POI-6884-2 steps out.//

**POI-6884-2:** He-llooo! Who might you be?

**A. Carter:** Hello there! We’re actually agents from local law enforcement and we just want to ask you some questions. Don’t worry, you’re not in any trouble.

**O. Johnson:** (//Quietly, out of earshot//) Yet.

**POI-6884-2:** Oh, marvellous. Please step inside and get out of the rain! How do you take your tea?

//Both agents enter the manor where POI-6884-2 directs them to a room containing chairs and tables to rest. He disappears for several minutes while preparing hot drinks.//

**POI-6884-2:** Here’s your tea.

**A. Carter:** Thanks, Mr Wilford. Um, is it okay if we begin the interview now please?

**POI-6884-2:** Yes, yes I do apologise, I’m holding you up. What do you want to know?

**A. Carter:** We’re just conducting an investigation into some strange ongoings in the local area.

**POI-6884-2:** Ah, I’m afraid you’ll have to be more specific.

**A. Carter:** We’ve had a surplus of accounts of a… well… big cat of sorts loose in the surrounding counties. 

//POI-6884-2 appears surprised and excited.//

**A. Carter:** We spoke to a guy in Mossmoor last week and he implied that you’d have some connection to the case. We’re just trying to find some leads.

**POI-6884-2:** (//Chuckles//) Yes, I was wondering when the Government would finally take my claims seriously! I must say I’ve become rather fascinated by the Beast in my latter years.

**O. Johnson:** The Beast?

**POI-6884-2:** Yes, The Beast of Bodmin Moor, Beast of Exmoor, Puma of Galloway, Phantom Cat of Mossmoor — The Big Cat of Dartmoor. Real anomalies these things.

**A. Carter:** (//Chuckles//) Yeah. We wanted to know if you’ve ever… maybe seen one yourself?

**POI-6884-2:** Oh, yes a few times actually; we’ve got what I suspect to be a breeding pair in Dartmoor based on… well, only my own suspicions admittedly, but it’s the only explanation for why they’ve been here so long.

**O. Johnson:** Do you have anything to support your claims? 

**A. Carter:** Our source from Mossmoor showed us a photo you took in 1998 that he reckoned caught one of the cats in a field nearby here.

**POI-6884-2:** Oh, yes, I do like to dabble in photography every now and again! I’ve got (//Stutters//) maybe six or seven photos of the cats. Mostly blurry mind you, but there’s a couple of decent ones.

**A. Carter:** Anything besides photos?

**POI-6884-2:** No, unfortunately. The cats are like phantoms — light, fast and utterly silent in their movement and speech. It’s like chasing a shadow.

**O. Johnson:** Speech?

**POI-6884-2:** I’ve sat out in the field where I took that photograph you mentioned for months just waiting to hear any roar or growl that wasn’t from a car engine, but my attempts proved fruitless. I placed a um… (//Clicking of fingers and stuttering//) trail-cam microphone in my spot and left it alone. One night. That was it. 2AM, it picked up a frequency of around 18 hertz, just out of range of what I could hear. [[footnote]] The average human ear can register sound between 20 and 20,000 hertz. [[/footnote]] Best of all, there were replies. They were talking with each other.

**A. Carter:** I see. Where exactly is this spot of high activity?

**POI-6884-2:** It’s just past ███ █████, about a mile from the brook.

**A. Carter:** Good to know. Thanks, Mr Wilford, you’ve been a great help. Oh, also you might want to expect a visit from some of our friends at Stan’s Cryptid Procurement, they’ll help piece this all together. [[footnote]] “Stan’s Cryptid Procurement” being a group of Cryptozoology Division personnel under the guise of a cryptid-research company whom acquired copies of all SCP-6884-related images within Wilford Manor. [[/footnote]]

**POI-6884-2:** I shall look forward to their arrival. Thank you for coming!

**A. Carter:** And thank you for your hospitality and confectioneries, Mr Wilford.

//Having visited POI-6884-2 in the late afternoon, it is now nighttime and raining heavily, creating poor visibility conditions.//

**A. Carter:** That’s interesting, though, that the SA-6884 [[footnote]] “Suspected Anomaly” being a placeholder prior to confirmation of anomalous nature. [[/footnote]] communicate at //just// under 20 hertz. It’s like they’re specialised to avoid human activity.

**O. Johnson:** Well that’d make sense, wouldn’t it?

**A. Carter:** How so?

**O. Johnson:** Think about it. It’s the late ice age and you’re a species of large cat that can’t get to mainland Europe anymore. After a while, these weird bipedal creatures start to visit; eventually they put two and two together and find out that you’re the one who’s been eating their sheep. Naturally, as we do, we defend our livestock. The cats meanwhile suddenly have people throwing sharp sticks at them and, rightly so, they adopt a way of communication that won’t say “hey look over here I’m gonna eat all your lambs”.

//A large black mass runs in front of the car, being caught briefly in the headlights before scampering into a nearby meadow.//

**A. Carter:** Woah, what the heck!

//Carter slams his foot on the brakes.//

**O. Johnson:** Wh-

//The pair sit in silence, the only noises audible being the heavy rain and windscreen wipers.//

**O. Johnson:** Check the dash cam.

//They briefly check the recording, which captures a quadrupedal black animal in possession of luminous yellow irises.//

**A. Carter:** (//Breathing heavily//) Call Gamma-4, we’ve got to be quick.

//Following the swift arrival of MTF Gamma-4, the SCP-6884 instance enters a nearby forest, forcing mobile containment personnel to continue on-foot.//

**A. Carter:** Johnson and four other guys follow me, everyone else try to come in on either side.

//Gamma-4 relays the command. The overhead helicopter illuminates the forest and fires neon-coloured darts towards the instance, striking its tail and allowing it to be more easily visible. While a squad of MTF Gamma-4 group with the agents, other operatives travel on either side in an attempt to instigate a horseshoe manoeuvre and surround the instance. The entity is semi-visible due to overhead lights and the containment team’s torches.//

**A. Carter:** EITS, how are we doing on thermal imaging?

**EITS:** [[footnote]] An abbreviation for “Eyes In The Sky” [[/footnote]] Maintaining a steady vector at around 10 metres from the target. It isn’t turning now that you’re fanned out.

**A. Carter:** How much forest has it got left?

**EITS:** Two miles. There’s a clearing with a ridge coming up so you could try to close in soon.

//After 2 minutes, the aforementioned area is reached. Spread-out operatives begin to tighten formation.//

**G4-11:** Ridge reached, closing in.

//The anomaly slows as it approaches the clearing. It ceases movement in the glen’s centre, seemingly searching for an escape route.//

**A. Carter:** (//Shining flashlight at the position, followed by the helicopters’ search lights. No entity is present.//) What the- 

//Upon investigation, a crack in the ground is slowly filling in with dirt.//

**A. Carter:** Do we have a low-pitch mic on us?

**G4-1:** Sure.

//Agent Carter places the instrument at the ground. It measures a sound of ~20 hertz frequency.//

**O. Johnson:** Damn.

**G4-1:** Get the Rats.

//Following a seismic scan, Mobile Task Force Zeta-9 (“Mole Rats”) were called upon to conduct an exploration of a large cave system located below the containment teams’ position. Explosives are utilised for access to the caverns.//

**Z9-1:** Flashlights on guys. Gamma-4, stay where you are in case the anomaly attempts to exit again.

**G4-1:** Will do.

//Zeta-9 enter what appears to be a passageway, stretching downwards at a gently sloping angle. They descend.//

**Z9-7:** So this is how they’ve been hiding.

**Z9-2:** Maybe. We still haven’t got any real information on the species, which is why we’re here — Command requested that we try to capture any instances alive for study if possible. You speak about them like you know something, Dash 7?

**Z9-7:** Not much really, but my mum lives in Somerset and she’ll swear on her life that these cats ate her terrier. It’s common knowledge that they’re out here.

**Z9-2:** All the more reason to-

//The sound of snarling and hissing are audible; presumably the result of a skirmish.//

**Z9-2:** Sounds like the system opens up further down, get ready to switch from torchlight to night-vis.

//3 minutes pass. Zeta-9 reach the termination point of the tunnel, ending in an expansive chamber at 90 meters below the surface. Remnants of surface-level materials adorn the floorspace.//

**Z9-2:** (//The skirmish is still heard, now audibly louder and closer//) What is going on?

**Z9-1:** We’re coming to another corridor. Everyone follow behind me, feet silent, weapons ready.

//Dancing yellow lights can be seen emanating from the next columned chamber, which seems to be the source of the uproar. Upon inspection, a group of approximately 15 SCP-6884 instances are present, with 2 fighting in the room’s centre while others observe, possibly as a part of a dominance display. The SCP-6884 brood are notably identifiable due to their distinctly glowing amber-coloured eyes.//

//Zeta-9 watch silently from the chamber’s entrance, when there is a sudden deeply pitched meowing from behind the Task Force. An infant SCP-6884 stands behind the group, and brushes itself against the Commander, drawing the attention of the adult instances.//

**Z9-1:** (//Surprised//) Ah! Um, where did you- uuuh, Gamma-4, Gamma-4, please be advised we are aborting the mission. Be prepared to tranquillise the targets. 

**G4-1:** Target**s**?

In the following events, 15 SCP-6884 members escaped containment via utilisation of their anomalous capabilities, though a single instance was funnelled out of its entryway and captured by the containment team. While under tranquillisation, a specialised containment method was devised in order to limit the entity’s escaping capabilities.

**Addendum 6884.2:** Containment Incident
Upon arrival at Site-44, the captured instance was placed within an observation chamber surrounding an aerated water-based suspension mechanism in addition to a floatation device while a more suitable method could be devised. The subsequent log is a recording of the moments prior to the SCP-6884-related incident.

**[BEGIN LOG]** 

//Researcher F. Ozz stands at the observation chamber window whilst a containment member monitors the chamber’s operations.//

**Researcher Ozz:** You’re sure there’s no rock or silicate-based products in there?

**Containment Specialist Green:** Absolutely. We’re pretty sure it can only manipulate materials it’s in contact with so we don’t have to worry about anything out here.

**Researcher Ozz:** Good. (//Sighs//) We’ve suspected that big cats were in Britain for a while but I didn’t think this was how they’d be hiding. 

//Agent Carter enters the room.//

**Researcher Ozz:** Ah, Carter! Good to finally have you back.

**Agent Carter:** Good to be back. (//Chuckles//) Nice containment solution, but what happens when it wakes up?

**Researcher Ozz:** There’s a float and the water’s salty with bubbles so it won’t, well… drown.

**Agent Carter:** Nice. (//Visibly confused//) I still don’t understand how we managed to find it, I mean me and Johnson were literally talking about how they’re great at hiding and then all of a sudden we’ve got one running straight in front of the car.

//Researcher Ozz is noticeably intrigued by this statement.//

**Researcher Ozz:** They always seem to be sighted from cars. What were you driving? 

**Agent Carter:** 2005 Defender.

**Researcher Ozz:** What colour?

**Agent Carter:** Black.

**Researcher Ozz:** I see. Green, could you go and ask Zeta-9-7 which colour car his mother drives?

**Containment Specialist Green:** Umm, sure?

//Specialist Green leaves the room.//

**Researcher Ozz:** Black colouration, purring engine, bright yellow headlights. It should’ve been obvious, that’s why people keep-

//An alarm sounds and the sound of gushing water can be heard. Both turn to face the chamber. The SCP-6884 instance’s tail can be seen disappearing into a large hole; its eyes are visible briefly glancing at the two before fleeing.//

The escaped entity was subsequently neutralised by on-Site security after living in the water system for three days — it and its undiscovered newly developing fetus can now be found in Cryogenic Storage Locker 089. Keter reclassification is pending.
