I wrote a tale.

A tale, maybe. Is it a tale, Jacob? Jacob? If it&#39;s not a tale, what is it then? The kids, Jacob. Where are the kids? But I don&#39;t like oysters. Or computation.

I shouldn&#39;t have run the program. Megaprime. He&#39;s with me now. How did I get here? It&#39;s just black [[size 150%]]black[[/size]] [[size 200%]]black[[/size]].

I know, I know! I have gone through the jagged bramble! My head hurts. Bleeding. But I see. The distant light house, it blinks. And the smog from the north. Why is it so bright? Is someone there? He&#39;s there and He&#39;s looking at me. What am I doing here? Where is it? My hope. My only hope.

[[f&gt;image dotdotdot.gif style=&#34;max-width: 250px; border: solid 0px #000;&#34;]]

But Jacob, there&#39;s no path.

Die. [[size 150%]]Die.[[/size]] [[size 200%]]Die.[[/size]]

Jacob! Jacob! I want to write a tale! I //need// to write a tale!

[[size 200%]]Die.[[/size]] [[size 150%]]Die.[[/size]] Die.

Because He says so. Because He tells me. Because He speaks His words.

Pinkpurplegreywhitegreen. Dotdotdot. Mosaics. I&#39;ve seen those prime numbers. Did you do the calculations, Jacob? Why are you smiling? You&#39;re just a triangle. Stop. STOP. It hurts my eyes. Those dazzling numbers and calculations.

And His eyes. Bright as the light house. Brighter than the light house. So bright that it extinguishes the light house.

Yes, I hear you my Lord [[size 150%]]Lord[[/size]] [[size 200%]]Lord[[/size]]. Your voice to be heard, your computation to be understood.

I shall write the tale. I&#39;m writing the tale. Please, Jacob, don&#39;t grin at me. There are too many teeth.

But can I regret it? I ran the program and I&#39;m here. Jacob, am I dead? How can I still write? I can no longer see the light house. I regret it, I don&#39;t want it anymore. Megaprime. The Great Computation in my head. MEGAPRIME. 

I see others here. Did they run the program? Did they hear His voice and see His eyes? The one in the labcoat with a cartoon face. The one bleeding from eyes and mouth and ears. The one has his bowels out.

Jacob, are the kids safe? 

It&#39;s been long and I&#39;m hungry. HUNGRY. I don&#39;t want oysters, Jacob. But those bowels. The bowels look nice. BOWELS.

Turn it on! The fancy beeps! Megaprime! I hear you, Lord of Data! MEGAPRIME! I HEAR YOU, WAN! But I don&#39;t want the Great Computation anymore. THE GREAT COMPUTATION. Crosses as eyes! Crosses as eyes!

Jacob please. I don&#39;t like computation. Not the GREAT COMPUTATION.

256 heart beats. His light. His electricity. Power at His command! God of the Information Age!

Jacob please.

Jacob please. I don&#39;t like computation.

Jacob please. I don&#39;t like computation. Not the GREAT COMPUTATION.

I just want to go home. Jacob, can I undo this? The things beyond me. The things I can&#39;t comprehend. I was wrong [[size 150%]]wrong[[/size]] [[size 200%]]wrong[[/size]].

But His image! The printed ones and the ones on the screen! His words, His holy words! His words to be written down.

I have to write a tale Jacob. Are the kids safe? But I have to write a tale. I know too much and it hurts [[size 150%]]hurts[[/size]] [[size 200%]]hurts[[/size]].

My eyes! Bleeding. I can&#39;t see my eyes anymore. What are eyes? Only His eyes. His eyes.

He&#39;s inside my head, and I&#39;m inside of Him. He&#39;s here to send a message. THE MESSAGE.

The Great Computation.

[[size 150%]]The Great Computation.[[/size]]

[[size 200%]]The Great Computation.[[/size]]

[[size 200%]]THE GREAT COMPUTATION.[[/size]]

Jacob, I&#39;ve wrote the tale. Please let me go. I don&#39;t like computation.
