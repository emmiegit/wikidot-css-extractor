{{**HISTORY:** Researcher Edward was discovered along with his prototype time travel device at the 20██ Science Competition at the █████-████████ High School in █████, ███████.}}

{{Foundation Agents embedded in the program interviewed Edward and discovered the device to be the result of a bootstrap paradox. While he did not invent the device //per se//, the engineering skills required to build the device warranted Edward a position at the Foundation. Edward accepted the offer and officially entered Foundation employment on ██/██/20██.}}

Edward might look like an obedient and dutiful one, always accepting new tasks, but most of them end up on the desk that he&#39;s too lazy to clean off. He can also overanalyze things at times, making an argument with him extremely irritating.}}

{{//I get it that the purpose is to keep the world sane, but can&#39;t we even tell close ones, ones that you really trust? All I wanted is to impress this girl, now I&#39;m saving the world and she doesn&#39;t even know if I&#39;m alive or not!// - Researcher Edward}}

{{On ██/██/20██, Researcher Edward&#39;s requests were (reluctantly) approved by the Ethics Committee.}}

{{The next day, Researcher Edward submitted the aforementioned individual, who appeared to be in massive paranoia, to Foundation custody for amnesticization.}}

+ Author Commentary

++ [[[SCP-3267|SCP-3267]]] - Memories Bound in Paper

&gt; Hah, my first article. I admit that, while having read many articles before joining, I did not quite grasp what I was supposed to do for a scip. At least I remembered to use the Critiques forum beforehand though, lol. 
&gt; 
&gt; After failing to get &#34;several&#34; drafts through to no avail (all of which I cringe upon now), I came up with an idea: A library ghost that is way too strict about the rules. And making up a story for a haunting is easy. But then I struck multiple plotholes, and was it not for the incredible help of people on chat, I wouldn&#39;t have made it. After countless suggestions and two major rewrites on the storyline, I finally settled with Hippo&#39;s ideas, and went for more of a FNaF-esque soul-transfer-thing. Now looking back at it, the scip in its entirety seemed quite incohesive, but I was relatively satisfied back then. And still relatively happy about it now. I might do a minor rewrite in the future, but it is unlikely.

++ [[[SCP-3726|SCP-3726]]] - AnthropomorFic

&gt; The inspiration behind this is somewhat simple and unrelated. I was thinking about the act of killing ants, how humans feel superior over small animals that can&#39;t fight back. Then I compared it to discrimination. I wrote the thing under an hour, and spent several hours getting feedback before posting it. Thinking back now, I should have gotten more, as the thing is quite a hit-or-miss. There are praises, and there are dislikes. I do plan to rewrite it in the future, but it&#39;d take time before I snap out of my procrastination and actually do it.

++ [[[are we flawed yet|Artwork]]]

&gt; How did you find this? No no no no, don&#39;t look at it, no, please, oh goddammit you looked didn&#39;t you.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, succumb to my cognitohazards.

++ [[[endless-light|Some Are Born To Endless Light]]]
&gt; Yay, something after 3 - 4 months of endless procrastination. 
&gt; 
&gt; Took inspiration from MaliceAforethought&#39;s [[[Time After Time]]], really cool tale, check it out. 
&gt; 
&gt; But really, how well this article did amazes me when I go back to check it. At the time of me writing this commentary, it hasn&#39;t gotten any downvotes yet, and even have quite a few upvotes from people who I look up to[[footnote]] Including a rare psul upvote yay [[/footnote]], so needless to say I&#39;m quite proud of this one. Also one year of not writing seems to narrow my vocabulary quite a bit, so I&#39;m quite surprised at how fancy the wording is.

++ [[[scp-4267|SCP-4267]]] - Down With The Flue
&gt; It was a year and a half between the writing of this scip and the last thing I wrote before it. I got into FRC, coolest program ever, but it also took a chunk out of my free time. When I returned, I did not have the motivation (or memory) to continue my ongoing scips, and decided to go with a new idea. 
&gt; 
&gt; I dug into my old idea dump and picked a randomly generated one involving a cannon and loneliness. Molded it into a claustrophobic article, with some details heavily inspired by The Enigma of Amigara Fault. However, my mind somehow got locked on a &#34;short-scip mode&#34; and could not for the love of God expand the article out, and what I wanted to convey was seriously limited. After several rounds of feedback (which were somewhat positive) I was still not confident that this would fly.
&gt; 
&gt; I talked with Hippo a bit, where his godly idea-filled mind imparted some wisdom on me. I switched to a chimney instead of a cannon, and even at one point came up with a fairy tale backstory (which I&#39;m quite fond of, actually). I looked for fairy tales associated with chimneys and palmed my face so hard when I found Santa fuckin Claus. The rest is shenanigans. And now you have a very dumb article which somehow appears as a different holiday figure to each viewer.
&gt; 
&gt; The ideas I got throughout the conception of this one are still viable and I hope to incorporate them into other things in the future.
