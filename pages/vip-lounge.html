Don&#39;t let the name fool you; it&#39;s available to anyone who&#39;s eligible to use SkipIRC!

We&#39;ve seen many users who were interested in IRC but left because they found the barrier to entry too high. Others have found the one-at-a-time nature of IRC connections to be troublesome. The VIP Lounge is our attempt to address that.

[[*user Hexick]] and [[*user Kufat]] have set up an instance of [https://thelounge.chat The Lounge] in its &#34;[https://thelounge.chat/docs/configuration#server-settings private mode]&#34;, hence the tongue-in-cheek &#34;VIP Lounge&#34; name. We&#39;ve added bugfixes and SkipIRC-specific enhancements to the latest available version of The Lounge, and will be keeping up with subsequent releases. We&#39;ve also set up a service where we&#39;ll register and configure users&#39; accounts to get them up and running, **with no esoteric IRC knowledge or special commands required!** Interested SCP Foundation Wiki members can fill out the form below and will receive a confirmation email that includes a temporary password.

++ Features

* **Persistent sign-on**: Once you sign on from a given browser, you&#39;ll remain signed in (like Discord or Gmail.)
* **Persistent connection**: Your session will remain connected to IRC even when you have The VIP Lounge closed, so you won&#39;t miss anything that&#39;s said in channels (or messaged to you) while you have your computer off or the tab closed.
* **Transparent connections from multiple computers**: Use the same nick and keep your chat history on your computer, your phone, your work machine, etc.
* **No command-line interaction required for normal use**. (For those who&#39;ve used IRC before, this means you won&#39;t have to {{/identify}}.) Identification will normally be accomplished via secure TLS certificate associated with your VIP Lounge account; all you&#39;ll have to do is log into the VIP Lounge once per computer. (As with any website, you may have to log back in periodically.)

Extra requests are //optional// and can include:
* Channels to auto-join
 * Defaults are: {{#site17}}, {{#site19}}, {{#thecritters}}, and a personal side-chat that will be registered with the user&#39;s chosen nickname. (e.g. #kufat) You can opt-out of any of these and add any others you like, provided you have access to the channel in question.
 * Channels that don&#39;t already exist will be registered to you, subject to common sense restrictions.
 * You may include a list of users to add as operators if you&#39;re requesting registration of a new channel.
* Additional nicknames to link to your account
 * These will effectively be synonyms for your primary nickname. They&#39;ll have the same channel permissions, etc.
* Pronouns for &#34;accepted&#34; and &#34;unaccepted&#34; fields. (The field above is for correct or preferred pronouns; these two fields are less often-used.)
 * Accepted: OK but not preferred. E.g. they/them for a person who identifies as binary male and uses he/him pronouns.
 * Unaccepted: Do not use these pronouns for the person in question. E.g. she/her/hers for the person above.
* A cosmetic host field if you want one other than {{vip.lounge}}. Alphanumeric with periods and dashes, no spaces or other special characters.

++ FAQ
+++ How long will it take for my sign-up request to be processed?
Requests are currently processed manually, so please allow us 24-48 hours or so. We do our best to handle them promptly.

+++ Who can see the contents of the form above after it&#39;s submitted?
[[*user aismallard]]: SCP Foundation Wiki admin, Tech Team co-captain, SkipIRC reserve oper
[[*user Hexick]]: VIP Lounge admin, Tech Team OS, SkipIRC oper
[[*user Kufat]]: VIP Lounge tech assistant, Tech Team OS, SkipIRC lead admin

+++ What if I already have a registered nickname?
You can still sign up; use your registered nickname and the associated email address on the sign-up form. We&#39;ll set up a VIP Lounge account and SASL EXTERNAL certificate but won&#39;t change any other existing settings (unless you want us to.)

+++ Can I still use IRCCloud, the other copy of The Lounge, HexChat, etc.?
Yes! We&#39;ll be keeping the other copy of The Lounge installed and will be porting over some of the tweaks and bugfixes from this one, although not all of the features will apply to that installation.

+++ Will you offer a bouncer for traditional IRC clients?
We&#39;re hoping to make one available in Q3.</textarea></pre>
