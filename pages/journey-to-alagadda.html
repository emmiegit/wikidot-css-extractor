&gt; 师徒四人在荒山野岭行了许久，疲惫之际，忽见一城池拔地而起，隐有锣鼓喧闹之声。那城墙耸立，又用了赤、金、白黑四色彩砖，好不气派。城外无甚么人，只有一军头，似是--
The four, master and disciple, having trekked through the barren mountains for long, are growing tired. Suddenly, they spot a city rising high, and hear sounds of the drumming of instruments and the bustling of streets. A city wall stands there, made of bricks of red, yellow, white, and black, truly a splendid sight. They see no others outside the city, only a head solider, who seems--

&gt; 见四人牵马上前，那守门的军头却是不惊反喜，从怀中掏出四个面具便迎上来，也不问何所从来、去往何处，将面具往三藏手中一塞便道：“诸位来得好！快戴了面具入城去！”
As the four draw near, leading the horse with them, the head solider guarding the gate seems not surprised, but rather pleased. He takes four masks out of his person, walking up to welcome the four. He asks not where they are from or where they are headed, thrusting the masks into Sanzang’s hands, and says: “Fellows, you come at a great time! Quickly, on with the masks and into the city!”

&gt; 军头却不恼怒，道：“长老有所不知，此处乃是阿罗诘达。正是国王大寿，有三日的庆典和筵席。庆贺之时百无禁忌，四洲来客都可上殿朝拜。只是怕来者繁杂，恶了王公大臣，都要选了假面戴上，如今却是已成习俗。诸位快些把面具戴好入城，不要误了时辰！”
The head solider is not annoyed, and explains: “Elder, you may not know, but this is Aluojieda. It is the King’s birthday, and there are celebrations and banquets for three days. There are no rules during the celebration, and guests from all four lands can present themselves to the court. Only that there are people of all kinds, good and bad. So the guests are asked to put on masks, in case they offended lords and officials. It is now a custom. Quickly, put the masks on and into the city. Best not waste time!”

&gt; 八戒也戴了那猪脸面具，只有行者让面具歪在头上，露出半张脸来。四人入城，果见处处张灯结彩，嬉笑之声不断，好不热闹。仔细看去，上至老人、下至顽童，果然人人佩有假面，其或作哭笑状，或习见于戏曲中，又有飞禽走兽的模样，怪诞至极。
&gt; 
&gt; 师徒四人走走停停，见那城中各处都有露天的筵席，摆了珍馐美酒，来往行人随意取用。又有侍从、侍女忙碌，叫那筵席取之不竭。众人左右顾盼，皆是颇感新奇。那八戒更是数次要偷离了队伍，钻到人群中，都被行者扯住。只是顺着大道行到王宫时，八戒手中已是拿了三五个盘子，正在狼吞虎咽。
Bajie puts on the pig mask as well, only Wukong lets the mask skew to the side, leaving half of the face in the open. The four of them go into the city, and indeed see lights and decorations everywhere, and hear laughter constantly. Truly a lively place. As they look closer, they see that from the elderly to the children, everyone wears masks, just as told. The masks depict happiness and sadness, portray characters from plays, or shape like birds and animals, truely bizarre.

The four of them meander about, and see that there are feasts hosted everywhere in the city, with delicious dishes and fine wine for the passersby to take freely. Servants and maids bustle around, making sure that the feast can continue indefinitely. The master and disciples look around, marveling at the sight. Bajie even tries to escape into the crowds several times, only to be caught by Wukong. Only that by the time they reach the palace through the main road, Bajie already has several plates in his hands, and is busy devouring the food.

&gt; 那阿罗诘达国王稳坐在王座上，却是没有假面。只见那国王神态威严，虽是大寿之时，却无丝毫老态，但有萧索苍白之态。所穿着的自是绫罗绸缎，脖子上、手腕上、周身各处又尽是金银饰物，好不奢华。见师徒四人入殿拜见，国王也不应答，只是侍立在一旁的大使上前--
The King of Aluojieda sits squarely on the throne, appearing solemn with authority, and does not wear a mask. While it is his birthday, he does not seem elderly at all, only slightly pale and gaunt. What he wears is of course silk and satin, with gold and silver jewelry all around his neck, wrists and torso, the most luxurious. As the master and disciples appear in the court for an audience, the King does not respond. The Ambassador standing next to him in attendance, however, moves forward--


&gt; “圣僧此言差矣！诸位远道而来，又恰逢国王大寿，是一桩大喜事。如不多加款待，岂不显得我国疏于礼数？还请诸位入席，今日定要宾主尽欢！”
&gt; 
&gt; 便吩咐道：“设宴！”王宫上下霎时间活动起来，有侍从安排桌椅，有侍女呈奉菜肴酒水。王公大臣也纷纷入席，立即就欢笑不断。那富丽堂皇、嵌着四色宝石的大殿间，就摆好了百人千人的筵席，这场面竟比此前所见街上的还要热闹百倍。
&gt; 
&gt; 师徒四人也被强拉了入席，八戒自然欢欣喜悦，便是三藏也不好推辞，终是一并落座。而这筵席中的也果真是珍馐美味，便是特地盛的素斋也鲜美非常。师徒四人虽是未尝酒水，不消半刻，也似要醉了一般。
“Honored elder, I cannot agree with you! You have come a long way, and it happens to be the King’s birthday celebration. What an occasion! If we do not treat you with hospitality, would it not appear that our kingdom is disrespectful and negligent? Please join the banquet, we must celebrate and enjoy ourselves today!”

The Ambassador then orders: “Prepare the feast!” All over the palace, movements start all at once: Servants are preparing tables and chairs, maids are delivering dishes and drinks. The lords and the officials all take seats, with cheers and laughter erupting immediately. The majestic palace, decorated with gems of four colors, is now ready for a feast for hundreds and thousands, a hundred times livelier than the sights on the streets.

The four of them are dragged in. Bajie is of course the happiest, but even Sanzang has trouble refusing the invitation, and eventually they all sit down. The food provided is indeed the most precious, even the vegetarian food prepared specially for them is delicious indeed. While they have not consumed any wine, they feel drunk from the atmosphere only in moments.


&gt; 那歌舞欢闹声越甚，行者也是摇头晃脑起来，面具更是歪到一侧。瓜果入腹，又着侍女去端，等待间，便往人群中张望。这一看不要紧，却是把行者惊出一声冷汗。筵席之中，哪有什么王公大臣、侍从宾客？那落座的，分明是披鳞带爪的妖魔，不见半个人影。哪有什么欢声笑语、歌舞不断？却是乌烟瘴气的一片。大圣顿觉不妙，再瞧时，三藏、八戒、沙僧果然不见踪影。行者立时起身，把那大桌也打翻--
As the song and dance grow louder, Wukong also starts to swing with the rhythm, his mask tilting to the side. Having consumed many fruits, he asks the maids to get more. As he waits, he starts to watch the crowds. But with just a look, he gets a good scare indeed. What lords and officials, servants and guests, partying in the banquet? The ones that sit among the tables are no other than demons with claws and scales, not one person in sight. What cheers and laughter, song and dance? Only a terrible miasma covering all of it. Wukong is suddenly alarmed, and as he looks closely, he finds that Sanzang, Bajie, and Wujing are nowhere to be seen. Wukong immediately stands up, overturning the large table--


&gt; 孙行者一个气急，扯了面具，抽出金箍棒来。那棒子一挥，宾客顿时四散，片刻就不知钻到何处去了。那四色的宫殿也一下子破败荒芜，似是许久不曾得用，都是脏污泥泞。
&gt; 
&gt; 行者四处张望，寻三藏等人不着，又见大殿空掉，失了目标，正抓耳挠腮之际，抬头看到那阿罗诘达国王还坐在王座上不动，便三两步迈到那王座前，就要扯住国王问话。
&gt; 
&gt; 只见大圣就着国王的领子一提，那国王就瘫软下去，大圣再提，却是一动不动，好似牢牢钉在王座上一般。行者一看，那国王身上的，哪是什么金银饰物？分明是厚厚的链子，层层叠叠拴在王座上。中间也不是什么绫罗绸缎，不过几块破布裹在一起，连人都不见。
Frustrated, Wukong tears the mask off, and takes out the Jingu Bang. As he swings his staff, the guests immediately scatter, and are gone within a moment. The palace with four colors suddenly becomes dilapidated and desolate, as if not used in a long time, covered in filth and mud.

Unable to find Sanzang and the others, and seeing that the palace is now empty, Wukong looks around with a sudden loss for what to do. As he is scratching his head in frustration, he looks up and sees the King of Aluojieda still sits on the throne, unmoving. Wukong steps towards the throne quickly, and plans to get some answers out of the King.

Wukong grabs the King by the collar, and the King goes limp. Wukong tries to lift him up, but the King is unmoving, as if nailed to the throne. Wukong looks more closely. What gold and silver jewelry on the King’s person? They are heavy chains, layers upon layers, linked to the throne. And the clothing between the chains is no silk and satin, but tattered cloths wrapped together, with no person inside.

&gt; 大圣行至殿外，只见整座城都空无一人，也无灯火、筵席，此前的喧嚣热闹再也不见了。又驾云上去一看，只有乌鸦盘旋，好似一座死城。
Wukong walks out of the palace, and sees the whole city devoid of person, with no lights and no feasts. The previous bustling is also gone. As he rides on the clouds to check from the above, he sees only crows circling, as if the whole city was dead.


&gt; 大圣求告道：“却是又遭逢一难！我师徒四人到了一地，名唤阿罗诘达，便入了城池、殿宇，见了国王、公卿。只是城中妖物作祟，筵席之中师傅、师弟就丢了，却是遍寻不着。还请菩萨相救！”
Wukong pleads: “We happened upon another tribulation! The four of us arrived at a place called Aluojieda, went to the city and the palace, and met the King and the officials. Only there are demons haunting the city. As we were feasting, I lost sight of my master and fellow disciples, looked everywhere for them, but could not find them. Asking bodhisattva for help!”

&gt; 菩萨道：“悟空，你再看，哪来的城池？”
&gt; 
&gt; 行者再去看时，却是一片空空荡荡的荒山野岭，半块砖都见不着，哪来的城池？只有一个大洞，那洞旁还有一颗歪脖子树，树上挂着一根绞索。行李和马匹却是都在洞旁，分毫不差。
&gt; 
&gt; 行者落下云头，向那洞里望去，只见一片泥淖，那三藏、八戒、沙僧三人都在其中打滚。行者将三人拽出来，三藏、八戒、沙僧也顿时如梦初醒，四周张望，又赶紧向菩萨道谢。
The bodhisattva asks: “Wukong, look closely, what city?”

As Wukong looks again, he sees only the barren mountains, empty, with not even a brick in sight. What city? Only a huge hole, with a crooked tree to the side and a noose hanging off its branch. The luggage and the horse are exactly as they were, next to the hole.

Wukong descends from the clouds, and looks into the hole. He sees a pool of mud, with Sanzang, Bajie, and Wujing all rolling inside. Wukong drags them out, and the three suddenly become sober, as if waking from a dream. They look around, and quickly give their thanks to the bodhisattva.

&gt; 行者还是置气，又挥起棒子，把那歪脖子树一打，半截树就折了，连着那绞索一道，落入洞中。行者这才心下安稳，随着三藏等人，启程去了。
Still angry, Wukong swings his staff, hits the crooked tree, snapping it in half. The broken half falls into the hole along with the noose. Feeling settled, Wukong follows Sanzang and others, setting off to their journey once more.</textarea></pre>
