Mom, 

I fucked it up again. I don’t want to be like this, I don&#39;t. I just can’t remember if it&#39;s ever been different.

I&#39;m lost, I&#39;m floating in the sea of it all, I can feel the undercurrent slowly dragging me down and in my struggle for breath, I can&#39;t help but admit that you were right. I was never ready for this. I don’t know who I am without you. I need you.

--I need to cry like I used to when you’d tell me I-- 

I can&#39;t recognize myself. I don&#39;t remember anything before you. I&#39;m not even sure if I remember you, at least not anything real about you. About me.

I don&#39;t //want// anything anymore. No. No, that&#39;s a lie, actually. Maybe if there was a way to know who was right and wrong, to know who you are, without a shadow of a doubt, I could move on.

But life is not a clear stream. Life is a muddy, murky lake with debris floating to the top and sinking back down on a whim, faces appearing and disappearing under the water, all whispering their own secrets. Swimming to the bottom gets me no closer to understanding.

I want to be treated with tenderness. I want someone to hold me and tell me that I&#39;m beautiful and perfect and that nothing was my fault, but I couldn&#39;t take it. I take it in doses, from therapists and short-lived friendships, --and men and men and men and me--

I need the bitterness too. I need the conflicting flavors to melt on my tongue in a perfect blend of agony and bliss. I need to be angry, I need to resent everyone and myself. I need to glue together the pieces I still have left in the shape of a person.

I need someone to tell me I&#39;m worthless again, I need something concrete, something I can //be.// Maybe if I grind it all down into a fine enough powder I can make a sand castle with it. Build a moat so the waves can&#39;t crash over me and make me dust anew.

--My body is a templ--

--My body is a fire pit--

My body is a furnace. I spend days going on empty, breathing in the ash and soot and clasping my blackened hands together in a silent prayer that one day it will finally fill my lungs. Other days I am alive with the fire licking my face, evaporating tears that will never get a chance to fall. I am aflame with hatred and it has nowhere to go. The pressure rips me apart and I cannot for the life of me remember where the pieces were supposed to be.

My mind isn&#39;t what it used to be. I can&#39;t be alone, can&#39;t be idle. It all wanders away from me too fast.

Like you, in a way.

--I miss yo--

I am no longer human. --Do you love me?--

Does it get better?

My old English teacher used to tell me that we could all be seen as rocks, and life a fast-moving stream that slowly rid us of our hard edges and outer layer, making us into something different. She never said better. Just different.

--Is it strange to miss the edges?--

Nevermind. It&#39;s fine. I&#39;m fine. Hope all is well. Say hi to Carmen for me.

-Ché
