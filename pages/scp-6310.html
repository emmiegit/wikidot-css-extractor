**Special Containment Procedures:** Access into protrusions of SCP-6310 must be monitored and restricted. Possible findings of new protrusions are to be investigated as soon as possible. Experimentation on ways to display information warning about SCP-6310 in a permanent way without being altered is ongoing. Specific procedures for each known protrusion are listed in their respective files below.

**Description:** SCP-6310 is a species of carnivorous vine-like plant inhabiting an extradimensional space with properties similar to those of the one housing Nx-01, the Wanderer&#39;s Library. Instances of SCP-6310 protrude into baseline reality through wormholes that form in the presence of large, long-standing Hume gradients or abnormally high Hume fields, particularly like those in and around places with large amounts of anomalous activity. In addition to the wormholes expanded to serve as entrances into SCP-6310 protrusions, are smaller, transient wormholes in the same area that are used to manipulate the nearby environment to attract victims, and possibly also to observe the imitated location.

All known protrusions of SCP-6310 appear as an approximate copy of a nearby location that is heavily frequented, positioned in a way meant to be easily confused for the real place. These imitations also always contain hazards meant to kill or incapacitate victims, built off of existing contents of the location being copied.

Once a victim is dead or incapacitated, dark green vines will emerge from the nearest surface and begin consuming them, first by rapidly absorbing most fluids in soft tissue, followed by absorbing them through the surface, presumably for full digestion.

Attempts to signal toward the real location and away from SCP-6310 usually backfire. SCP-6310 exhibit the ability to remotely modify the environment near protrusions in small ways, such as altering the location of warning signs to mislead victims, or making warnings about itself illegible.

[[tab SCP-6310-1]]
**Copied Location:** Way to the Wanderer&#39;s Library inside an abandoned apartment building in Mexico City.

**Specific Procedures:** The building containing SCP-6310-1 and the original Way has been acquired by a Foundation front real estate holdings company, entry is strictly forbidden. Anyone attempting to enter the building or exiting the original Way is to be detained and questioned.

**Description:** The symmetrical layout of the building leads to the two Ways being easily confused. The requirement to open the Way[[footnote]]Commonly known as a &#34;Knock&#34;, this one requiring the presence of a cat[[/footnote]] doesn&#39;t seem to be replicated by SCP-6310, making it even easier to accidentally enter SCP-6310-1 instead.

The interior of SCP-6310-1 looks like a normal section of the northeastern shelves of the Wanderer&#39;s Library. SCP-6310 seem to only create as big an area as is necessary for a convincing recreation, as the hallways only extend approximately 100m in every direction, which combined with the labyrinthine layout of shelves in that section of the Library, is probably enough to create a convincing illusion.

The books on the shelves inside SCP-6310-1 appear normal, but are randomly interspersed with lethal cognitohazardous agents in text or image forms.
[[include component:image-block
| name=Mixup.jpg
| caption=Example of an image found in a book in SCP-6310-1 (cognitohazardous triggers hidden)
]]

**History:** SCP-6310-1 was the first SCP-6310 protrusion discovered by the Foundation, after PoI-47520 and PoI-47342, thought to be members of a Serpent&#39;s Hand cell in Mexico, were reported missing. Questioning of a known member of the same cell revealed they last told her they were going to look into a rumored Way into the Library closer to their home.

An investigation team deployed to the building the Way was claimed to be in found two almost identical Ways inside closets in apartments on opposite sides of the building, only one of which disappeared without the accompanying housecat and allowed Foundation personnel to enter. The door to the apartment containing the real Way had a sign tacked on reading:

&gt; //[Translated from Spanish.]//
&gt; Wanderers: there is a false Way behind this door. What&#39;s beyond it might seem like the Library, but it&#39;s a dangerous fake. Do not enter. You&#39;re looking for the other apartment.

This was later understood to have been switched from the opposite door by SCP-6310.

One member of the investigation team was killed by a cognitohazard as they inspected one of the books on the shelves; however, they were able to be recovered and cut off from the vines before they could be absorbed into the floor.

**Additional Notes:** An inquiry into using cognitohazards from SCP-6310-1 books for other purposes is ongoing.

[[tab SCP-6310-2]]
[[include component:image-block
|name=Stairs.jpg
|caption=Entrance to SCP-6310-2
]]
**Copied Location:** Underground pub in Three Portlands.

**Specific Procedures:** SCP-6310-2 is contained in cooperation with the Unusual Incidents Unit and local law enforcement due to the heavily limited jurisdiction of the Foundation within Three Portlands. The entrance to SCP-6310-2 is to be sealed and display a sign claiming it is closed under the guise of health and safety code violations.[[footnote]]This sign does not appear to be affected by SCP-6310&#39;s ability to modify warnings. Whether this is because it&#39;s too indirect a warning for SCP-6310 to understand it or another type of limitation to its abilities is currently unknown.[[/footnote]] TPPD units operating nearby are instructed to stop, report, and redirect individuals trying to enter SCP-6310-2 towards the real establishment.

**Description:** SCP-6310-2 is located at the same relative position on its street as the real pub it imitates, only one block south, closer to the city center. Externally, it displays the same signage as that used on the real pub, and the layout of its interior is the same.

SCP-6310-2 contains several humanoid entities; two groups sitting around tables, and one individual behind the bar. The groups behave similarly to a group of friends, but are seemingly incapable of perceiving outside stimuli and their actions reset every time someone enters the empty pub, looping after approximately 15 minutes.

The entity behind the bar is more active and capable of communication, though mainly limited to selling drinks and simple conversation. It is most likely not sapient and only a simple mechanism to aid SCP-6310 in incapacitating their prey, and any attempts to extract useful information about SCP-6310 or anything outside SCP-6310-2 have failed. Both the patrons and the bartender are unable to be removed from SCP-6310-2, as they&#39;re all fixed to the surfaces they&#39;re on.

All drinks served inside SCP-6310-2 are mixed with extremely fast-acting poisons intended to kill or paralyze victims before they can leave.

**History:** SCP-6310-2 was discovered by TPPD officers patrolling the area and reported to the UIU. Investigation afterwards linked SCP-6310-2 to at least five missing persons reports in the area. The Foundation was later contacted by the UIU for help establishing containment, and sent samples taken from behind the walls which seemed to be plant matter. A potential link with SCP-6310-1 was made and samples were collected, with very similar genetic makeup, leading to the proper discovery of SCP-6310 as a species.
[[/tab]]
[[tab SCP-6310-3]]
**Copied Location:** Site-66 subterraneous greenhouse complex.

**Specific Procedures:** All personnel employed by or visiting Site-66 are to be informed that sub-basement 3 is an administrative floor and not to exit the elevators on the side resembling a containment area. All measures attempted to prevent the back doors of elevators from opening on sub-basement 3 have failed.

**Description:** SCP-6310-3 imitates the greenhouse containment wing[[footnote]]The main containment area for plant-based anomalies.[[/footnote]] of sub-basement 4 on Site-66, appearing on the opposite elevator door to the administrative section on sub-basement 3. The interior of SCP-6310-4 is visually identical to the copied location.

Within the containment chambers in SCP-6310-3 there are visual copies of several anomalies contained in sub-basement 4 such as SCP-████, SCP-███, and SCP-████, though none of them present their usual anomalous properties.

When a victim (probably intended to be personnel tasked with upkeep of the plants) enters one of the containment chambers, the door will be automatically shut behind them and the watering systems will begin rapidly filling the chamber with water, leading to drowning.
[[/tab]]
[[tab SCP-6310-4]]
[[include component:image-block
|name=Building_Entrance.jpg
|caption=Entrance to SCP-6310-4
]]
**Copied Location:** Lobby of a United Nations administrative building built on top of a Global Occult Coalition site near Amsterdam, NL.

**Specific Procedures:** Containment of SCP-6310-4 is currently managed by the GOC. At least 2 security personnel are stationed outside the entrance to SCP-6310-4 to redirect anyone seeking to enter the building towards the correct entrance.

**Description:** The entrance to SCP-6310-4 takes the form of the entrance to a UN building which contains a GOC site underneath. The interior is the most different from the original location of all known SCP-6310 protrusions, resembling the real lobby, but extended to reach the side of the building SCP-6310-4 is on. The interior is mostly empty except for a reception desk.

SCP-6310-4 will wait for victims to walk in a long enough distance from the entrance before activating GOC turret defense systems, normally reserved as a deterrent for attacks on the site or to neutralize escaping anomalies. These are entirely a product of the plant and do not respond to GOC controls.

**Additional Notes:** Attempts by the GOC to neutralize SCP-6310-4 have failed. SCP-6310 appear to have extraordinarily fast regenerative abilities, and returned to normal seconds after explosives inside were detonated.
[[/tab]]
[[tab SCP-6310-5]]
**Copied Location:** Unknown.

**Specific Procedures:** There is currently no way for the Foundation to contain SCP-6310-5 or any other SCP-6310 protrusions without a known entrance.

**Description:** SCP-6310-5 is a protrusion physically very close to SCP-6310-3, being the only one close enough to another for its interior to be visible to our current tools. No direct connection has been found between SCP-6310-5 and SCP-6310-3, and specimens of SCP-6310 so far observed seem to prefer spreading out their bulbous structures, possibly indicating that SCP-6310-5 is part of a different specimen growing adjacent to the one containing -3.

The limitations of the tools used to see into SCP-6310-5 mean data on it is very low on detail, however, observations so far have failed to match its interior to any place on Earth. It appears to contain some type of very dense forested area, punctuated by small buildings. Its area is approximately 1km^^2^^.

Some activity has occasionally been detected inside and in the plant tissue surrounding SCP-6310-5, probably correlating to victims entering it. These events occurred at an average of once a week when monitoring of SCP-6310-5 began, but have since dropped to approximately once a year, possibly indicating the exhaustion of viable prey or some form of intentional containment.

Some distance away from SCP-6310-5, vines and protrusions of the same specimen have been observed slowly drying out and being discarded. This might indicate that instances of SCP-6310 must slowly spread to find more wormholes to exploit as previous ones run out of or stop attracting prey.

[[tab SCP-6310-6]]
[[include component:image-block
|name=Music_Shop.jpg
|caption=Interior of SCP-6310-6
]]
**Copied Location:** Chander&#39;s Music Shop in Denver, CO, over the underground portion of Site-███.

**Specific Procedures:** The entrance to SCP-6310-6 is to be covered by scaffolding under the guise of renovations. More permanent measures are being considered.

**Description:** SCP-6310-6 is located 2 blocks east of Chander&#39;s Music Shop. Both internally and externally, it is as an identical copy of the store. The instruments within SCP-6310-6 themselves appear to be non-anomalous, but any musical instrument played inside SCP-6310-6 will be amplified in volume to approximately 250dB, causing spontaneous pneumothorax and often cardiac arrest in most subjects.

The source of the amplification appears to be the walls of the store, resonating with the instrument&#39;s sound and amplifying it. The tissue behind the walls of SCP-6310-6 appears to be composed of the same proto-muscles found in the tendrils used to consume its prey. The door to SCP-6310-6 also vibrates, though this appears to be in an attempt to cancel out the noise that would otherwise escape through the protrusion.

Genetic samples collected from SCP-6310 instances outside its camouflage do not resemble any plants known on Earth, but they do share much stronger similarities with some collected from the Wanderer&#39;s Library, namely //Captio bibliothecarum//[[footnote]]Name used in texts about species endemic to the Library. The genus //Captio// does not exist in Earth taxonomy, and its exact origin is unknown. It is very likely this species made its way to the Library from a different universe outside it, though failure to accurately trace its origins and the high likelihood of it having had a long time to adapt and succeed in the Library&#39;s peculiar environment has lead to the species name //bibliothecarum//.[[/footnote]], an incredibly successful carnivorous vine that preys on pollinators by imitating nearby flowering plants to a great degree of precision. Their genetic similarities and similar forms of predation strongly indicate a common ancestor.

How the space SCP-6310 inhabit originated, with its structural similarities to that of the Library, as well as how a common ancestor of SCP-6310 and //C. bibliothecarum// might have arrived there, are unknown. It&#39;s currently believed that a mutation might have given it mild ontokinetic abilities, leading to the creation of the space, possibly as an attempt to imitate the Library itself.

SCP-6310&#39;s regenerative abilities have made it so far impossible to carve a way to the outside of any protrusions, however, penetrative scans show a web of vines punctuated by many bulbous structures containing the spaces it imitates, extending beyond the range of all devices that have been used. The vines sag downwards between the round structures, possibly indicating that the wormholes used to attract prey also serve to anchor the plant in place, as the space outside SCP-6310 appears empty and no other supporting structures have been seen.

The current leading hypothesis to explain SCP-6310&#39;s abilities to manipulate wormholes and change its environment is that the unusually high Hume levels within SCP-6310 allow for a degree of reality-bending abilities. This might explain the apparent variability in its capacity to alter the environment around protrusions, such as the sign used in the containment of SCP-6310-2, as Three Portlands is an area of higher-than-average Hume levels, disallowing the large Hume differential that SCP-6310 might need to alter it.

As the process by which SCP-6310 create copies of places has not been observed, the exact mechanism for it is not fully understood, but it likely resembles the way in which //C. bibliothecarum// can change its form to imitate nearby flowers, rather than being fully done with its reality-bending properties.
