i do not know if i was born a
monster
or if i was made into one
by harsh words and too many needles,
but i don&#39;t think it matters.

what&#39;s important
is that i have a
gaping
maw
where my heart should be
and everything i do
risks exposing it.

my memories of being a
monster
go back to elementary school.
when i was in fifth grade,
i played a game of freeze tag
with the other kids at recess.
the girl who was it
caught me because i couldn&#39;t run fast enough,
and i was so angry
that the jaws burst out of my chest
and
swallowed
her
whole.

my parents and teachers
believed that i would grow out of it,
and they were kind of right,
but you can never really
stop being a monster,
you can only get better at hiding it.

i kept devouring people in middle school.
my teachers and friends
were trained on how to react,
but i could always tell
what they were thinking
when i would
tear
someone
apart
for talking to me
after i failed a geometry test.

in high school,
i know everyone was talking
about how many people are
dead because of me.
i saw their glares when they thought
i wasn&#39;t looking, felt their judgement
whenever i was facing the other way.

and how could i blame
anyone but myself?
i am everything
they say i am.

today i&#39;m in college,
and nobody knows
who i am. nobody
has seen what i&#39;m
really like.

now, i have to be careful.

i shouldn&#39;t go out to that bowling alley
with my friends from high school
because i might lose and get upset
and let the jaws burst out of my chest
to devour someone again,

and i shouldn&#39;t talk to any
of the new people in my classes
because they might find out about
all the people i&#39;ve eaten and make
me hated by the entire school,

and i should really just cut
off those old friends because
they all know what i am and
there&#39;s no point in trying to be close
with people who are aware of the
monster behind the act and besides
they&#39;re all probably just pretending
to like me anyway,

and really i shouldn&#39;t
stop at just my old friends
because anyone i
connect with is someone who can
spurn me later for being the
monster that i am
so i should probably also cut off
my mom and dad and brother
and girlfriend and internet friends,

and i especially shouldn&#39;t try to have a
good career or make any sort of
living off my writing because
all that requires the approval
of other people which i can
never keep because i have
no heart and the jaws will
rip apart everyone i know
eventually and
everything i touch is
destroyed and i
don&#39;t even know
why i&#39;m trying
to get this
worthless degree
or interacting
with other people
or going
outside when
i&#39;m defective and
my fate is sealed and
and
and
