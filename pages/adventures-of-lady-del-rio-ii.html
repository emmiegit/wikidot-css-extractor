&gt; //You are always a rock to me in the stormy sea I call my life. You are the brightest star in the sky in the night my life has become of late. You are dependable, and I cannot thank you enough for it.//
&gt; 
&gt; //I saw this manuscript at the Bazaar last week and I was reminded of your explorations of the strange cults of the Great Plateau. Perhaps you can shed some light on the people who believe in it, or discern whether it&#39;s a hoax. If nothing else, you may find the poetry and symbolism engaging; I was quite enraptured as I read this strange omnibus. Regardless, I&#39;m sure it will find a loving home in your personal library, where maybe again someday we&#39;ll enjoy each other&#39;s company.//
&gt; 
&gt; //I look forward to your next letter and the day we&#39;ll finally be reunited. Until then, remember that I love you as deeply as from the deepest depths to the highest peaks.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Truly yours,//
&gt; 
&gt; //Mira//

^^1^^At the beginning and end of everything there is the Serpent called Ab Ess. ^^2^^All comes from Ab Ess, Light and Dark, life and death, the Sea, the Land, the Sky. ^^3^^It is said that the Serpent spewed forth Creation from its maw. ^^4^^First It breathed forth darkness and the Sea. ^^5^^Then came the Stars and Moon. ^^6^^Ab Ess then breathed a great Fire which became the Sun. ^^7^^The Sun scorched the Sea which frothed and boiled and Land rose from the foam. ^^8^^The foam also gave up fish and things of the Sea ^^9^^and as the lands dried the plants and beasts and people rose from the mud. ^^10^^The Sea fell as the Sun rose. The Sun touched the highest peaks, burning them and causing them to boil as water. ^^11^^From the churning rocks came forth creatures of the sky, birds and locusts.

^^12^^The Serpent wanders endlessly through the night, consumed by ravenous hunger. ^^13^^As the Sun rises every morning, the Serpent bites Its tail and rests. ^^13^^Its teeth are sharper than swords, ^^14^^and longer than any spear. ^^15^^Its scales are harder than the hardest iron and thicker than than any shield. ^^17^^About Its neck the Serpent has a mane of feathers. ^^18^^No chariot can roll faster, nor any beast run faster, than It slithers across the ground. ^^19^^No person can catch It in Its untiring haste. ^^20^^No creature of the Sea nor any boat of people can sail or swim as It swims through the Sea. ^^21^^Its great eyes see All; nothing escapes the Serpent&#39;s sight.

^^22^^It is called Ab Ess and Its name is curs√®d and must not be spoken lightly.

^^1^^There was a warrior called Hevar who worked the beasts of the fields. ^^2^^He raised the beasts, and tilled the fields; his brother Cahyn sowed the crops. ^^3^^When it came time for harvest, Hevar would slaughter the beasts and Cahyn would reap the fields. ^^4^^Both carried great swords of iron, half as long as a man is tall.

^^5^^One day as Hevar tended his flock he realized some cattle had gone astray. ^^6^^He secured the herd and took with him his sword to find the lost cattle. ^^7^^As he wandered in pursuit of his beasts, the Sun fell low and the sky grew dark and Hevar was lost. ^^8^^He wandered by starlight for some time before he heard his cattle bellowing in fear. ^^9^^Hevar followed the sound through the wilderness and came upon Ab Ess consuming his cattle.

^^10^^Hevar was struck with fear at the sight of the Serpent. ^^11^^Its length stretched farther than he could see. ^^12^^Its scales shone as pearls. ^^13^^It ate his largest bull as a child eats berries, ravenously and with ease. ^^14^^As Hevar watched in fear the Serpent&#39;s eyes fell upon him.

^^15^^In Its eyes Hevar saw all of Creation. ^^16^^The birth of the Earth and Its death, the Serpent spewing forth the stars and Sea. ^^17^^Hevar saw in Ab Ess&#39;s eyes every cruelty of man and beast and the world. ^^18^^And at the heart of everything Hevar saw lay the Serpent, Creator and Destroyer. ^^19^^Hevar knew Ab Ess was the Father and Mother of All, but also the Devourer and Destroyer.

^^20^^And in Its eyes Hevar saw cruelty. ^^21^^The Serpent knew of the pain of Its Creation and felt no pity. ^^22^^Its motivations were beyond Hevar, beyond humanity, but Hevar saw that they were Cruel.

^^23^^In that moment, Cahyn came upon the scene and knew the Serpent before them was Ab Ess. ^^24^^Before Cahyn could call out to Hevar so they may flee, Hevar was filled with a great fury. ^^25^^Hevar saw the Cruelty of the Serpent called Ab Ess and knew a rage like no other. ^^26^^In his rage Hevar drew his blade and ran towards the Serpent, though he knew it was without hope. ^^27^^Cahyn could not bear to watch his brother be devoured by the Serpent and fled.

^^28^^In the time that followed Cahyn told the story of Hevar the Brave. ^^29^^He told the story of the Serpent and Its insatiable hunger, its immeasurable cruelty. ^^30^^And in telling his story, Cahyn knew Hevar&#39;s rage was born of love, of hatred for cruelty. ^^31^^And so it is that we who are born of Cahyn must tell this story, and must act with love in all we do.

^^32^^So goes the Book of Ab Ess, may His name forever be a curse.
