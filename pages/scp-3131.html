**Item #:** SCP-3131

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3131 instances are to be stored on a modified desktop computer in Site-11&#39;s Digital Archives. For research purposes, every SCP-3131 instance in containment must have at least one backup copy retained in a digital storage device. A backup generator has been provided in case of power failure. See addenda content for specific SCP-3131 instance care procedures.

MTF Nu-31 (&#34;Audiophiles&#34;) has been assigned to routinely scan all pertinent websites for uncontained SCP-3131 instances, and initiate recovery and transport to Site-11. If possible, the original copies of these instances are to be deleted from the website&#39;s server.

To aid in discovery of SCP-3131 instances, Foundation facilities have been advised to assist MTF Nu-31 with monitoring scans as necessary. Any confirmed SCP-3131 instances discovered are to be immediately retrieved and transported to Site-11. Standard disinformation protocol is to be followed regarding individuals involved. If standard protocol is deemed insufficient, the use of Class-A amnestics has been authorized.

**Description:** SCP-3131 designates anomalous sapient digital entities manifesting as audio files under the MP3 (.mp3) file format. Researchers have determined that SCP-3131 instances most commonly occur on websites hosting illegal free downloads of copyrighted music[[footnote]]Examples of such websites include &#34;Pirate&#39;s Bay&#34; and &#34;UTorrent&#34;.[[/footnote]]. However, considering the behavior of cataloged instances prior to recovery, the phenomenon responsible for the existence of SCP-3131 is currently unknown.

Based on behavioral observations, SCP-3131 instances exhibit the following properties:
* Awareness of other SCP-3131 instances within a device.
* Capability of perceiving human speech when inputted through a microphone.
* Limited communication through manipulation of their audio data.
* Ability to create and modify file folders (most commonly observed in the act of changing folder names).
* Ability to manipulate a digital media player or similar software.

Unusual examples of SCP-3131 behavior are compiled in Observational Log 3131-██-███. Individual instances of SCP-3131 are given numerical sub-designations based on order of discovery.

&gt; **Observational Log 3131-██-███ Excerpt:** Partial logs from notable observed behaviors of SCP-3131 instances cataloged at Site-11.
&gt; 
&gt; **Case 34:** SCP-3131-34 (&#34;thunder.mp3&#34;, containing the song //Thunder// by Boys Like Girls) was retrieved following the interception of a social media post regarding a defective laptop believed to be &#34;haunted&#34;. Foundation personnel recovered the laptop in question, and subsequently discovered SCP-3131-34 in a Desktop folder which was named &#34;fix your battery&#34;. The owner of the laptop reported never creating personal storage folders on the Desktop space.
&gt; 
&gt; **Case 50:** SCP-3131-50 (&#34;somewhere.mp3&#34;, containing the song //Somewhere Only We Know// by Keane) was renamed &#34;simple-thing.mp3&#34;. Immediately following this change, SCP-3131-50 only played repetitive garbled clips of the lyric sections &#34;why&#34; and &#34;this could be&#34;. One hour later, SCP-3131-50&#39;s playback changed to the lyric section &#34;simple thing, where&#34;. One hour following this, SCP-3131-50 played the corresponding song normally.
&gt; 
&gt; **Case 67:** SCP-3131-67 (&#34;not-alone.mp3&#34;, containing the song //Not Alone// by Linkin Park) was moved from a desktop to an external storage drive, and moved from said drive back to the desktop. When played, SCP-3131-67 repeatedly streamed the lyrics &#34;through the storm&#34; for 2 minutes and 48 seconds.
&gt; 
&gt; **Case 88:** SCP-3131-88 (&#34;RESTART.mp3&#34;, containing the song //Styx Helix// by Myth Roid) resulted in unusual startup behavior[[footnote]]The computer in question repeatedly turned on and off for five hours.[[/footnote]] of a desktop assigned to the SCP-3131 project. Researchers hypothesized that the antivirus software installed on the desktop moved SCP-3131-88 to the recycle bin deletion queue following an automatic scan. Following restoration of SCP-3131-88 to its initial location in the &#34;My Documents&#34; folder, the desktop operated normally. However, when played, SCP-3131-88 simply repeated the &#34;please don&#39;t let me die&#34; lyrics from its original song. This change was observed recurring for six hours; when moved to a newly-created folder titled &#34;Music&#34;, SCP-3131-88 then played the original song content normally.
&gt; 
&gt; **Case 88.2:** A non-anomalous audio file named &#34;dogbark.mp3&#34; containing 13 seconds of barking sounds recorded from a Siberian Husky was introduced to the folder containing SCP-3131-88. Approximately five minutes after the copying process, &#34;dogbark.mp3&#34; was renamed &#34;my.dog&#34;. The content and playback of the non-anomalous sound file remained unchanged.

It is noted that while SCP-3131 instances can be read by any suitable media player, doing so requires consumption of nearly ten times the usual amount of memory necessary to play non-anomalous music files. Under prolonged circumstances, playing SCP-3131 instances often results in hardware failure and corruption of the instance itself. Research for more effective technology for storing multiple SCP-3131 instances remain ongoing.

**Addendum 3131-1:** Repeated attempts[[footnote]]Multiple trials were conducted, with various SCP-3131 instances which were chosen based on the complexity of the lyrics of their corresponding song files.[[/footnote]] were made to communicate with SCP-3131 instances in experimental lab settings. It was eventually determined that audio input via microphone into a computer with an appropriate instance of SCP-3131 open in a music-playing program would facilitate simple discussions. The following is a transcript of the first successful &#34;interview&#34; with an SCP-3131 instance.

&gt; **Interview Log 3131-275**
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Kenoma Versoza, Site-11
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewee:** SCP-3131-275 (SCP-3131-275, &#34;coffee.mp3&#34;, containing the song //Tom&#39;s Diner// by Suzanne Vega)
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Versoza:** I&#39;m going to ask-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3131-275:** //I am waiting.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Versoza:** Okay. My first question, where are you right now?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3131-275:** //Out the window. On the corner. Behind the counter.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Versoza:** Can you be more specific?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3131-275:** //I am thinking.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Versoza:** Okay. Take your time.
&gt; 
&gt; [The lyrics &#34;I am thinking&#34; repeat for 2 minutes, with each having an interval of 10 seconds.]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3131-275:** //Someone watching me.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Versoza:** Yes, I am watching you. Can you answer the question now, please?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3131-275:** //No. She does not.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Versoza:** Well, then. Second question, who... what are you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3131-275:** //The coffee. I am. The coffee.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Versoza:** Your name is &#34;coffee&#34;?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3131-275:** //Only halfway.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Versoza:** Did you name yourself &#34;coffee&#34; or you&#39;re named &#34;coffee&#34;?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3131-275:** //And I look. The other way. To pour the coffee.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Versoza:** That&#39;s... Okay, third question, where did you come from?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3131-275:** //Before the rain began. There&#39;s a woman. Who had died. Cause she sees. Her own reflection. Through the morning. Her hair. Has gotten wet. And so. Does she see me?//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Versoza:** Who is this woman?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3131-275:** //I&#39;m pretending. Not to notice//.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Versoza:** Notice what?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3131-275:** //That she&#39;s hitching. She is shaking.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Versoza:** Would you like me to call you &#34;coffee&#34;?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3131-275:** //Nice.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Versoza:** Thank you for your time, Coffee.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3131-275:** //I finish up my coffee.//
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Addendum 3131-2:** On September 3, 2017, Foundation computer C-2516 (used to store backup copies of 230 SCP-3131 instances) underwent a highly unusual booting behavior for a period of eight days, during which the reboot process repeated continuously. Maintenance personnel were unable to identify any hardware failure associated with storing and containing multiple SCP-3131 instances that might have influenced the problem.

While the cause for the malfunction remains unknown, C-2516 resumed normal operation on September 8, 2017. However, it was discovered that approximately 50 new file folders were generated on the desktop, given generic numbered titles such as &#34;new home 1&#34;, &#34;new street 2&#34;, and &#34;new building 3&#34;. The instances of SCP-3131, which had initially been in a single folder, were spread out between these new folder locations.

**Addendum 3131-3:** On September 29, 2017, seven Foundation researchers conducted a series of interviews with 19 SCP-3131 instances, which had congregated in a folder named &#34;new council&#34;. These instances communicated by renaming themselves variants of &#34;listen-to-me-now&#34; and &#34;silent-now&#34;, apparently relying on the researchers to play them in the correct order to facilitate the conversation[[footnote]]The semi-coherent speech generated by the combined efforts of the SCP-3131 instances included sentences &#34;need more / space to / buildings / please / think of / so many / more&#34; and &#34;just to hide / belong with / together.&#34;[[/footnote]]. 

These interviews ranged from political topics, including a particular &#34;event&#34; regarding multiple ownerships of &#34;new building 45&#34;, to safety interests such as plans for expanding the current monitor used at C-2516 for the creation of more &#34;new safe buildings&#34;. It is noted that as of September 30, 2017 the population of SCP-3131 instances stored on C-2516 has nearly doubled, with the majority of &#34;building&#34; folders being occupied by groups of three to four SCP-3131 instances. 

**Addendum 3131-4:** Further investigation uncovered the presence of several hidden folders in C-2516, titled with variations of the phrase &#34;safe house&#34;. Discussion is underway regarding further storage and interaction options for SCP-3131 in an effort to better understand the instances&#39; capacity and motivation for increasingly complex behavior. Use of [[[task-forces#kappa-10|MTF Kappa-10 (&#34;Skynet&#34;)]]] operatives as mediators of future interactions is pending review.
