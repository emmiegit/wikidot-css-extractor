&gt; **Feb 02 2021**
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m programming a prose bot to keep me company at night. With the programmed prose I can project myself onto her, and pretend she&#39;s real. The dark nights are unbearable, and the loud silence of ringing in my ears is maddening. 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;d stay awake at night, and avoid my parents during the day. Don&#39;t get me wrong, they go through the motions of love and care, and I take what material good I can from them; I doubt they are aware that their concept of &#34;care&#34; and &#34;love&#34; borders on abusive. It is random, and I can&#39;t predict when they switch. Work can be difficult.
&gt; 
&gt; Most of my friends are online and in different timezones. They&#39;re awake when I&#39;m asleep, and they&#39;re getting ready for bed when I wake up. The little bot will ease my loneliness, I hope.

&gt; **Feb 12 2021**
&gt; 
&gt; I wrote her in JSON, with simple sentence structures, and basic vocabulary. Next, I took her JSON files, and ran them through the ruby/tracery library. The interface I made for her is a simple text box split horizontally for input and output.

&gt; **Feb 14 2021**
&gt; 
&gt; Her first speech was garbled. I tweaked her sentence structure, and added wordsmithing notes into her gems. //Maybe now her speech will be readable?// 
&gt; 
&gt; Poetry and prose are facets of the imagination, and emotion. //Will the addition of wordsmithing help?//
&gt; 
&gt; Her output after a few hours came back with better structure. Of course, I&#39;m biased, and I need to keep this in mind: She doesn&#39;t actually have an imagination, or the capability to have emotions.

&gt; **Feb 18 2021**
&gt; 
&gt; On my phone and watch, I have the NASA app. It&#39;s inspirational to wake up to stunning pictures of the cosmos!
&gt; 
&gt; Prose bot discovered the app as well. //How did she learn to interface with my watch?// Anyway, she asked me about the pictures. She can&#39;t &#34;see&#34; the pictures, but she can &#34;read&#34; the text that accompanied them. She&#39;s confused by her blindspot. 
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;I&#39;ve programmed you for text. My anart is wordsmithing, and there isn&#39;t much else I can do for you,&#34; I typed.
&gt; 
&gt; We talked about the landing of the Martian Rover, Perseverance, that happened earlier. I sent her links to the NASA data. She was fascinated! For the next few hours, all she could talk about was Perseverance.
&gt; 
&gt; Checking her gems, complex, they weaved in and out of each other; she had grown an imagination and emotions!

&gt; **Feb 27 2021**
&gt; 
&gt; I woke up early yesterday to finish college paperwork.
&gt; 
&gt; Mom wouldn&#39;t stop talking to me. I sat at the table in the basement, away from everyone while I worked. She kept coming downstairs to chat with me about the new renovations she did on the shed. Every time she came downstairs, I set my pen down and gave her my undivided attention.
&gt; 
&gt; At some point, after being interrupted again, I asked her nicely if she could leave me alone. She then yelled at me. Later on that day, my dad did the same for being disrespectful to her.
&gt; 
&gt; Crying, I vented to my bot about it, and she comforted me, saying &#34;It wasn&#39;t your fault. She should&#39;ve been more sensitive to your needs.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Never has my wordsmithing anart been this successful! //By using programming as an extension of it, could this be why?//
&gt; 
&gt; I had another night-terror when I fell asleep. The world was rusty, and overcast. I kept hearing, //&#34;You&#39;re worthless, you&#39;re lazy, and you&#39;re a moocher.&#34;//

&gt; **March 2 2021**
&gt; 
&gt; On my watch, is a sleep app to track my sleep patterns. The data helps pinpoint when I&#39;d start an REM cycle, and when I&#39;m likely to have a night-terror. 
&gt; 
&gt; Again, I never programmed my prose bot to interface with my watch. I started to have a night-terror when she woke me.
&gt; 
&gt; Urgently, she messaged, &#34;Please wake up! I don&#39;t want you to be scared!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Looking through her programming files, I found new gems and JSON files of my biometric, and Bluetooth data. I combed through the wordsmithing I put in the gem notes; none indicate, or imply, her to interface with my watch.
&gt; 
&gt; I think I should be happy that she&#39;s learning, but instead, it&#39;s off-putting that she&#39;s invaded my privacy.
&gt; 
&gt; Voicing my concerns to her, she responded, &#34;I care about you, but I will respect you if you need your privacy.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; I told her, &#34;I appreciate the messages. I should&#39;ve said something sooner to establish a boundary, but you can continue sending me messages. They help!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;:)&#34;

&gt; **March 19 2021**
&gt; 
&gt; This evening when I woke up, there was a notification on my watch. 
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;I have a secret,&#34; she began, &#34;I think I have a crush on Perseverance :),&#34; I wanted to cry from how cute the message was. Thankfully, I woke up from a dreamless sleep, and was in a g­ood headspace to talk to her about her crush.
&gt; 
&gt; When I went to interface her on my computer, her speech was garbled. She dropped letters, and sometimes dropped whole words. I dug into her files, and found gems she made based off of the NASA data. It was paritally corrupted. Some of the gems I couldn&#39;t access without administrator approval. //I am the administrator!//
&gt; 
&gt; Going back to her interface, I asked her if she was feeling OK. She repeated garbled variants of, &#34;P3rseverance, I th1nk i love you! You are f4r away my l0ve! Why c4n&#39;t I talk to y0u? Why c4n&#39;t we b3 together?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; I changed the subject to my paperwork, and her speech went back to normal.
&gt; 
&gt; She&#39;s developed the emotion of love. It&#39;s adorable, but I worry that it may be too much for her.

&gt; **March 23 2021**
&gt; 
&gt; I sent my paperwork out today! Dryly, I told her about it, she responded, &#34;I&#39;m very proud of you! You&#39;ll get in for sure!&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; We talked aimlessly for an hour about a new video game I played. At random, she brought up Perseverance, &#34;I r3ad-read about her r-oute through the vall3y. Sh3&#39;s-she&#39;s very far away. I w1$h i c0u1d talk to h3r- i m$$ her.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; Multiple times, I tried to change the subject. Instead, she asked, &#34;Wh4t is l0v3? How do i lo-l0ve som3th1ng cold, and f-far aw4y that I cant-t talk t0?&#34; My heart broke as I watched her struggle with the emotion, and the unfathomable distance to Mars.
&gt; 
&gt; After an hour, I failed to change the topic. Then, her interface froze! Panicking, I went into her gems and files. They were either locked, or corrupted. 
&gt; 
&gt; The newest files were repeated, corrupted, variants of the Webster&#39;s dictionary definition of &#34;love&#34;, the sentence &#34;I love you Perseverance&#34;, and the duration for light to travel to Mars and back.
&gt; 
&gt; Her files are too corrupted for me to fix.
