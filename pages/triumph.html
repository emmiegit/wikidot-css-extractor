Hello. Nice to meet you.

I&#39;ve brought you out of containment and took that tarp off you, for which you&#39;re welcome. To be honest, I shouldn&#39;t have done the latter; it&#39;s against the containment procedures. Normally I&#39;m a stickler for the rules, but frankly, I just needed someone to talk to. You&#39;re the kind of thing it&#39;d feel good to talk about this stuff to.

It all started a few days ago when I saw a movie. Horror movie, decently made. An object that influenced people in some pretty nasty ways, with horrific, terrifying results. Sounds familiar, doesn&#39;t it? 

Anyways, it was the kind of movie that really worked off the strength of the audience you&#39;re seeing it with. Lots of gasps, verbal expressions. The audience I was with was audibly depressed at the ending, for example. Everyone except me, that is. I was happy. Proud, even.

See, in movies like the one I watched, they tend to end with the Bad Thing surviving. Gotta leave the option for a sequel open, I guess, even if there won&#39;t be one. Maybe I&#39;m strange, maybe I&#39;m oversensitive, but that thought sticks with me longer than anything else in a movie. The world of the movie continues spinning, and the Bad Thing is going to keep doing what it does. People will still be scared, hurt, and killed, and there&#39;s nothing to stop it.

But here, in reality? We have us, the Foundation. I&#39;ll let you in on a little secret: I //hate// most of what I have to do in this job. I hate reading about otherwise decent people being kept under lock-and-key because they can&#39;t help who they are. I hate having to give a widower a pill that&#39;ll make him forget he had a wife and kids. I hate when I ask the higher-ups if we can //maybe// adapt an SCP for the world&#39;s benefit, only to be rejected. I hate throwing D-Classers at things just to experiment. Jesus Christ, I even fucking hate what we do to Six Eight Two. I have no proof of it, but I&#39;m pretty goddamned sure I&#39;ve self-medicated on Class-As just to forget how horrible I feel about this fucking job.

But with things like you? Things like you make this job worthwhile. When we get our hands on you, **nobody else dies**. We figure you out, we put you in containment, and //the story ends//. Oh sure, your information is stored in thousands of safe places, but in any practical sense even //we// forget about you. You act in the shadow, and we keep the sun above you. We&#39;ll //keep// doing it until our sun toasts this world.

Well, that&#39;s all I have to say. I get this is kind of gloating, but I&#39;ll be honest: I needed this. I needed to let one of you things know that we always win out. In a few moments I&#39;ll be leaving this place, and you&#39;ll be back in containment. In a few hours, I&#39;ll have inevitably forgotten which SCP I pulled out, and you&#39;ll be in containment. If I quit this job in one piece, you&#39;ll be in containment. When I die, you&#39;ll be in containment. When I&#39;m dust, you&#39;ll be in containment.

Your story is over.</textarea></pre>
