**Item #:** SCP-6846

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-6846 is to be stored in a standard safe vault. It may be removed for testing, and, with permission of at least a Level 2 Researcher may be utilized during field missions, unless otherwise noted. Any removed portion of SCP-6846, including SCP-6846-2 through -9 as they currently exist are stored individually, with the same storage conditions.--

SCP-6846-1 and -3 through -9, as of ██-██-20██, are uncontained. POI-68382 (Azazel Simons) the creator of the anomaly, escaped from Foundation custody, utilizing a minor thaumaturgic ritual to breach containment of SCP-6846. Warding on the safe vaults have been examined, and found to have faults that previously went unnoticed. An investigation into these faults, and the breach itself, has been opened, but is considered low priority. Regular inspections of the warding have been scheduled.


**Description:**  SCP-6846-1 is a slightly faded, black, Levi&#39;s-brand denim jacket, with the sleeves removed. At the time of discovery, it had, sewn onto it, patches of various designs and materials, designated SCP-6846-2 through SCP-6846-9. Based on areas of lesser fading on the jacket, at least five more patches exist, the nature and location of which are unknown to the Foundation.

SCP-6846 was discovered in a raid on POI-68382, with information recovered from [DATA EXPUNGED] [[footnote]]Information on retrieval mission redacted to maintain anonymity of various informants.[[/footnote]]

SCP-6846-1’s primary property is the ability to bestow new anomalous properties onto any patch sewn onto it. The particular effect is determined by the pattern or image on the surface of the cloth, and the intent of the addition, and becomes stronger the longer the two are sewn to each other. Additionally, -1 and all affected patches are highly durable. Summaries of the patches and their anomalous properties are given below. --No additional instances are to be created outside of approved testing environments, and any such patches are to be destroyed by procedure 6846-D--. Only SCP-6846-2 remains in Foundation custody (see Incident Report CB-6846).

Summaries of the patches and their effects follow.


||~ Designation||~ Description||~ Notes||
|| SCP-6846-2 || A small pouch with a zipper. Painted black, with a red cross roughly in the center. Empty by all outside observation. On being opened, contains medical supplies, the specifics of which are determined by how the user defines medical supplies, and their current needs. || Available to be utilized during missions with Level 2 researcher approval. In case of emergency, retroactive approval may be granted. Sole anomaly remaining in Foundation custody. ||
|| SCP-6846-3 || Black, painted with a yellow serpent and the text “Remembering Everyone” || On physical contact with the patch, an individual will have a hallucination of somebody they once knew, but have not seen in at least two years, whether for social reasons, or for reasons of death. In cases where there is no individual fitting that description, the individual may have a hallucination of somebody they never personally knew, or may have no hallucinations at all. (see Experiment Log 6846-03 for specifics) ||
|| SCP-6846-4 || Black, white text reading “fuck da(sic) police” || Cogitohazardous, induces excruciating headaches in any security personnel or criminal enforcement agents who view it. ||
|| SCP-6846-5 || Depiction of a thunderbolt. || Contact with the patch will invariably result in an individual experiencing a strong static discharge on their next contact with a conductive material. The shock is harmless, if uncomfortable. ||
|| SCP-6846-6 || A pouch, fitted to contain a disposable lighter. Plain white, except for a crudely painted “no smoking” symbol in the middle. || Manifests an empty, white butane lighter within it, if one is not in it for six hours. These lighters have no anomalous properties of their own. Additionally, slowly refills any lighter in it, at such a rate that an empty lighter refills in six hours. If a full lighter is in it, it has no anomalous traits. ||
|| SCP-6846-7 || Currently a pink triangle || Alters its appearance to reflect an accurate Nazi concentration camp badge for the last individual to touch it. Is an accurate predictor of conversion to Judaism and of closeted transgender or homosexual persons, even if the individual in question is not aware of such themselves.||
|| SCP-6846-8 || Circular, white background with a regular ({7/3}) heptagram. || No clear effects. ||
|| SCP-6846-9 || Formerly the back patch. Painting of the cover of the album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death by The Dead Kennedys. || Viewed from different angles, reveals more of the scene, beyond what is contained in the original album cover, as though viewed through a window. Additionally, the flame borders move, occasionally nearly dying out, or flaring up and consuming the scene. All of these effects are purely visual.||

**Subject:** Security Guard

**Procedure:** POI-68382 forces the object upon the guard.

**Results:** Guard is functionally incapacitated by hallucinations. In post-breach interview, reported seeing his former colleague, ████ ████, who was demoted and transferred in 2005, in the wake of a major corruption scandal implicating her. [[footnote]] For more, see Robert Smith&#39;s //Secure Corruption: An Investigation of Alleged &#34;Quid Pro Quo&#34; Favors Between Security Guards and Prisoners in Foundation Custody// (2005).

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**22:34**: POI-68382 (hereafter, simply &#39;POI&#39;) sits in their cell, meditating. Deviation from their typical meditation routine is noted by a security guard, but ignored. 

**22:40.34**: Site-XX Safe Vault cameras, as well as the camera in the POI&#39;s low-security display only darkness for three frames (1/10 of a second).

**22:40.35**: Camera shows POI wearing a denim vest (presumably SCP-6846) over their standard issue Foundation detainee uniform. All patches appear to be in the locations they were in when the jacket was seized, save for 6846-2, which is not present. Sensors in the low-security cells detect a warping of local reality, consistent with a thaumaturgical ritual. 

**22:41**: On-duty security guard arrives at cell, having visually detected the presence of the vest and seen the thaumaturgical energy spike.

**22:42**: Guard struggles with electronic keycard. POI pulls out a lighter, which they use to light a sheet of woven cardboard strips, from the cardboard meal trays used to serve prisoners. 

**22:43.15**: Guard succeeds in unlocking cell. POI rushes the guard, forcing SCP-6846-3 onto his hand. Guard is functionally incapacitated by hallucinations, post-breach interrogation revealed report of his former colleague, ████ ████, who was demoted and transferred in 200█, in the wake of a major discovery implicating her in an internal corruption scandal. 

**22:43.l20**: POI strips guard while he is incapacitated, and dons the guard&#39;s uniform. They proceed to rub their face with ash from the cardboard weaving.

**22:44**: POI, now with a mild antimemetic field, presumably from a second thaumaturgic ritual involving the previously burned cardboard weave, walks steadily through the facility, following exit signage.

**22:45**: Breach alarm and escape notifications triggered by guard. Location of the POI is not easily identified

**22:48** SCRAMBLE units activated, POI located near exit.

**22:49**: POI walks out of the exit.

**23:01**: Escape of POI and breach of SCP are confirmed.
