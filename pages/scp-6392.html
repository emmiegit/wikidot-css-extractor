**Special Containment Procedures:** Site-421 is maintained at the entrance to SCP-6392 under the guise of a small-scale mining operation. The underground section of the site is to keep two seaworthy vessels available and in good condition at all times. 

Explorations of SCP-6392-1 are not to last any longer than twenty days, and personnel interacting with the anomaly must be provided with an airtight hazard suit. Individuals returning from such expeditions are to be tested for neurological dysfunctions and made to undergo physical therapy regardless of the results.

**Description:** SCP-6392 is a subterranean cavern located near the Avernus Crater in Cumae. Prior to the construction of Site-421 at the mouth of the cave, SCP-6392 could only be accessed via a natural crawlspace, which has since been filled with rubble. SCP-6392 has a volume of ~52,500 cubic metres and is elliptical in shape. Its eastern end contains a shallow beach and an opening which leads into an extradimensional space, designated SCP-6392-1.

SCP-6392-1 contains an ocean of indefinite breadth and depth. The sky within the anomaly is permanently overcast, with intermittent rainfall. From within SCP-6392-1, the portal to SCP-6392 is embedded in a spur of stone rising out of the sea. Other land formations such as small islands and crags are scattered intermittently throughout SCP-6392-1.

SCP-6392-1 has an earthlike atmosphere and its ocean is composed exclusively of molecularly pure water.[[footnote]]Under normal circumstances, pure water would leach oxygen and nitrogen from the atmosphere. This has not occurred in SCP-6392-1.[[/footnote]] Matter exposed to SCP-6392-1 undergoes a slow process of degradation; it first becomes perforated and then disintegrates entirely. A cinderblock takes just over one month to be reduced to dust. This effect is more pronounced with intricate structures such as circuit boards, which decohere within hours. Physical fragility is also associated with a faster rate of decay, meaning that items made out of soft plastics, glass, and weak fabrics break down very quickly within the anomaly. Radio signals within SCP-6392-1 are unreadably corrupted when transmitted over distances greater than a few dozen kilometres.

Microorganisms introduced into SCP-6392-1 experience a near immediate breakdown of their cell walls and lyse. Human microbiotas are exempted due to the ‘insulating’ effect of the surrounding body. Animals immersed in SCP-6392-1 experience progressive ataxia, cognitive impairment, and generalised nerve damage. These afflictions can be tolerated for approximately five days, with considerable variation between individuals. 

Protection from the elements is possible through the wearing of protective clothing and limiting one’s own exposure to the anomaly.

**Addendum 6392.1:** Exploration

On 02/05/2022 the first manned exploration of SCP-6392-1 was attempted. The SCPS Relicta, a twenty-man vessel, was chosen for the trip. The expedition was intended to last three weeks. The vessel did not return by 03/06/2022, one month later.

A rescue attempt was mounted. A smaller ship, the SCPS Mnemosyne, was tasked with shadowing the Relicta’s travel plan and finding its crew. The Mnemosyne was expected to take sixteen days to ascertain the Relicta’s position and make the return voyage. It returned after thirty. Four of the five crew survived; Doctor Vanth was killed; her body was recovered intact. None of the Relicta’s crew were found alive.

The crew of the Mnemosyne refused to answer questions about their mission. They were therefore sequestered in Site-421, pending the arrival of a dedicated interrogator. The transcripts of the subsequent interviews have been provided below.

&gt; **__Interview Transcript, VANJ-190622.01__**
&gt; 
&gt; **Interlocutors:** Interrogator &#39;█████████ █████&#39;, Technician Avery Fames
&gt; 
&gt; **Date and Time:** 12/07/2022, 8:30am

&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** Good morning.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fames:** Doctor, there’s blood under your eye.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** Oh, you’re right. Thanks. (Clears throat) I’m going to start with basic questions and build up to what I want to know. If you feel uncomfortable, we can stop at any time.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fames:** Mhm.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** Sorry, could you meet my eyes?
&gt; 
&gt; **Fames:** S-sure.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** How many people were aboard the Mnemosyne?
&gt; 
&gt; **Fames:** Five.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** Name them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fames:** Technician Fames, that’s me. There was also Agent Skye, Technician Devana, Senior Agent Hearse, and Doctor Vanth.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** Had you worked together before?
&gt; 
&gt; **Fames:** Yes. I’d known the other members of the crew for years. Devana and I have been working together since university. Vanth and I saw each other out of work hours; Hearse was attached to her at the hip so of course, I knew him too. Skye was the only person that I didn’t recognise but that’s only because she was new.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** How did you feel before you departed?
&gt; 
&gt; **Fames:** Redundant. Everyone else had taken hostile environment training at some point in their careers. And anything that I could do, Devana could do better. I- I didn’t know what I was doing. Most of the others weren’t comfortable with the mission either. Vanth was the exception; she was exhilarated. She loved to explore.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** But this was a rescue mission.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fames:** She was the onboard medic, and at the outset of the mission there was nothing for her to do, so she just sketched. She drew the sea, the landmarks, and sometimes patches of the sky. It was her ritual. Everyone had one of those. Devana and Skye would play chess. Hearse talked to Vanth. I worked long hours and kept tabs on everyone’s health. Devana knew more about running the ship than I did, so I tried to make myself useful in other ways.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** What was the beginning of the journey like?
&gt; 
&gt; **Fames:** It was rough, but to the degree that we had all expected. Everyone lived belowdecks. If you needed to work topside you had to put on a bulky apparatus, like a spacesuit. They had isolated oxygen supplies since the local atmosphere wasn’t safe to breathe.
&gt; 
&gt; Even so, the protection was only partial. When I was on deck, I could feel the nerves in my fingers boiling from the outside in. After day one, the sensation was up to my nailbeds, and I couldn’t feel the tips of my fingers.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** Were there any accidents?
&gt; 
&gt; **Fames:** Not for the first leg. We would listen to the radio and see if we could spot the silhouette of a ship on the horizon. Nothing came up. I guess the one notable incident was when I found Vanth standing on deck without a suit. Just breathing in the air. She smirked and said: ‘how much of a brain do I have to lose anyway?’
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** What was it like to be inside SCP-6392-1?
&gt; 
&gt; (Fames procures a written-on piece of paper)
&gt; 
&gt; **Fames:** ‘My breath was flush with different shades of white, and it sounded like radio static when the air hit my lungs. Avery told me there was a corona of blood over my eyes. Spotty, scarlet perforations in the capillaries around my irises. I thought they looked cute.’
&gt; 
&gt; ‘I threw a bottle into the ocean. It exploded into a million fragments. Tiny, indivisible shards. They bled platonic constituents. The concepts of sharpness, clarity, ellipticity, containment. When the first three fields collided, they formed a forest of broken glass.&#39;
&gt; 
&gt; &#39;There was blood dripping from my palm, where the moisture on the railing had bitten into my skin. I suckled on the wound. Tasted like oranges. I flexed my fingers. A million tiny raptures rattled against my skin as the atmosphere sanded me down. I wanted it to continue, so that I could see if at the centre of myself, there is an oyster pearl or a seed. Or maybe there is nothing irreducible about me.’
&gt; 
&gt; Vanth wrote that in her journal.
&gt; 
&gt; (Silence)
&gt; 
&gt; **Fames:** Doctor?
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** You can leave. Thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fames:** I’m sorry.

&gt; **__Interview Transcript, VANJ-190622.02__**
&gt; 
&gt; **Interlocutors:** Interrogator, Technician Valerian Devana
&gt; 
&gt; **Date and Time:** 12/07/2022, 9:31am
&gt; 
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; (Begin transcript)
&gt; 
&gt; **Devana:** Have we worked together before? My memory has been damaged.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** We&#39;ve never met. Tell me about how you discovered the Relicta.
&gt; 
&gt; **Devana:** We discovered the SCPS Relicta after nine days. It had lost power and ran aground upon a cluster of sea rocks. Much of the crew had disembarked. Technician Fames and I donned our work suits in order to make contact.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** How many of them had survived?
&gt; 
&gt; **Devana:** Of the original crew of twenty, we counted nine. There were possibly more aboard the hulk of the Relicta but it was too precarious to attempt an exploration.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** Were the crew alright?
&gt; 
&gt; **Devana:** The survivors were catatonic and unresponsive. They flinched when touched, but did not speak or show any comprehension of their surroundings. It was apparent to the naked eye that their eardrums and irises had been perforated.
&gt; 
&gt; The skin of each specimen was very fragile and gouged when handled. They suffered some damage as we brought them aboard. After arriving on the Mnemosyne, they began to randomly interact with their surroundings: writing repetitive anecdotes in notebooks, arbitrarily turning door handles, following members of the Mnemosyne&#39;s crew, et cetera. We locked them in the hold.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** You began to make the return journey shortly thereafter.
&gt; 
&gt; **Devana:** Correct, though not before we took advantage of the stop to perform some maintenance on the engine. Our ship was powered with diesel. Diesel engines require a constant input of air, so the components were severely worn down. Fames and I replaced what we could and applied a protective coating to the assembly. 
&gt; 
&gt; However, while we had exhaustively provisioned for anomalous engine damage, we had neglected to check for mundane sources of failure. There was an undetected blockage in the fuel injector and so the engine had been overheating. This heat had warped the pistons and cylinders, which had been grinding against one another since the voyage began.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** Why was this important?
&gt; 
&gt; **Devana:** Two days after retrieving the Relicta’s crew, one of the cylinders cracked and began leaking. The engine ran rough and we lost most of our propulsion. Although this was easily corrected with a welder, many other components had suffered damage as well. The engines couldn&#39;t be run at full power anymore, else they might have irreparably ruptured.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** How did the crew respond?
&gt; 
&gt; **Devana:** They spent a little while calculating how long it would take the Mnemosyne to reach port. It would have taken us five days to return before the engine broke. Afterwards, we discovered that it would take fifteen. Still, there was an air of confidence about the room. We had brought enough food and water for thirty healthy, active adults. We buckled down and prepared for a longer trip than anticipated.
&gt; 
&gt; Our provisions held out. However, SCP-6392-1&#39;s deleterious effects upon our psychologies could not be averted. Within a few days, we were incapacitated.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** What did it do to you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Devana:** Looking inward, I can tell that something is missing; my thoughts are emotionless and hollow. Since the expedition, existing has felt like watching a particularly uninteresting film.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** Tell me about how the last segment of the expedition went.
&gt; 
&gt; **Devana:** I spent the last ten days of the expedition lying on my mattress, unresponsive. Everyone suffered as I did except for one, who fed us and kept us alive. I do not remember their face. I recall that they were wronged. Nothing more.

&gt; 
&gt; **Interlocutors:** Interrogator, Agent Minerva Skye
&gt; 
&gt; **Date and Time:** 12/07/2022, 10:36am

&gt; 
&gt; **Skye:** What&#39;s your name, biddy?[[footnote]]A British slang term used to disparagingly refer to an older woman.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Interrogator:** That isn&#39;t relevant. Tell me about what went wrong during your return trip.
&gt; 
&gt; **Skye:** Poor girl. They didn&#39;t even let you keep it. (Sighs) Well, fine. Fames lost sensation in her fingertips within the first day of the mission. It didn&#39;t stop there.  I began feeling tired no matter how much I slept. I would constantly nap, sometimes for minutes and sometimes for hours. Occasionally my entire arm would be filled with pins and needles and other times my entire body went numb and I would have to crawl around because I couldn&#39;t stand up straight. At first I thought it was nothing, just stress and fatigue getting to me.
&gt; 
&gt; It took far too long for us to realise that something was wrong. I remember Devana asking me to crunch some numbers after the engine broke. It was an easy question, high school algebra, and- and none of us could solve it. Three grown adults working on the same basic derivative problem and not //one// of us could come up with the answer. When I looked at the page the problem felt... //colossal//. I almost had a panic attack.
&gt; 
&gt; That night, when I went to bed, I heard a moist fizzling sound between my ears. And every day, it got a little more muffled, and a little closer to the centre of my skull. Every day I looked in the mirror and my eyes looked duller. I have an auntie who&#39;s in a nursing home with dementia, and I- I looked like her. Grey eyes and a vacant, thousand-yard stare. I wasn&#39;t the only one, either. When Fames talked to me, I thought she was gazing //through// me.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-6392-1. God, I- I- I- felt it inside of me, like someone was pulling my nerves out through my digits with a pair of tweezers. Every time I breathed, it left me raw. I would go to sleep and wake up nauseous, vertiginous, not knowing where I was. Sometimes the room would spin out from under me and the world would look impossibly large, and I would scream for hours because I thought I was falling.
&gt; 
&gt; It amputated my faculties and reduced me to something vulnerable and helpless, an infinitesimal, embryonic //thing//, hardly able to hold a spoon well enough to feed myself. Nobody could keep their shit together but Vanth. She was still able to stand and think rationally. I don’t know how. I don&#39;t even think that //she// knew.
&gt; 
&gt; About nine days after the engine broke down, my sense of self unravelled. My brain centrifuged itself into a jumble of skills, memories and personality traits, and spilled out of my head. The same thing happened to everyone else. There were these tattered glowing ribbons dangling out of our ears and eyes. When I tugged on my own, my mind unwound like a ball of yarn. Fames and I talked during one of our brief episodes of lucidity and we figured that if we were both seeing them, they couldn&#39;t have been hallucinations.
&gt; 
&gt; We were losing ourselves, everyone but the doctor. She had what we were losing, //and// what we needed to survive: a functioning brain and intact ribbons. I... rationalised what I did next. Devana and Fames came to that same conclusion on their own. We intimidated Hearse into going along with it.
&gt; 
&gt; The next time she came to feed us, we ripped her brain out through her eyes. I grabbed a string and pulled. I saw it all come tumbling out of her: decades of lived experience, coils of emotion, unfulfilled ambitions. We used her mind to patch up the holes in ours. We couldn&#39;t fill in every gap, but it was enough to restore some of our faculties. //Enough// of our faculties. Avery Fames stole her compassion. Devana took her rationality. Kyle Hearse hoarded her memories. I cannibalised her neuroses. Insecurities are so pliable, so multifaceted. You can use them for anything. Some people are just bundles of them put together: nothing but anxiety and obsession. (Laughs)
&gt; 
&gt; They declared the Relicta’s crew dead when they saw what they had become: just empty bodies, biological automata missing their software. We did worse to Vanth. We ate her alive.

&gt; 
&gt; **Hearse:** I remember everything. I have memories of two lifetimes. I know how awkward I was in first grade. I feel, viscerally, how adorable she thought I was in high school, whenever I cornered her to talk about my hobbies. I remember her patience, her encouragement, and how much we couldn&#39;t imagine living without each other. God- what…
&gt; 
&gt; I know what it was like for her to stand on the deck and breathe in that caustic air. I know that she thought that it was beautiful. She tried to save us: she worked on the engine until her fingers were raw, and fed us canned fish and water even when we would just thrash and spit it out. I can still feel her last thoughts echoing. Screaming to me: &#39;It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s okay.&#39; Trying to comfort me for //murdering// her.
&gt; 
&gt; Jacquelyn, why didn’t you stop me?
