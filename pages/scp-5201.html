++ **Special Containment Procedures:** 
&gt; 
Domesticated SCP-5201 instances are currently contained in the Fauna Containment Wing of Site-235. Due to incidents of cannibalization within specimens, no more than one SCP-5201 instance is to be contained per containment cell. Each specimen is to be fed with one newborn mammal with a mass of at least 1 kilogram on a weekly or bi-monthly basis. Piglets are the most cost-effective and available such animals, but other species may be substituted as deemed necessary.

The following objects have been identified to cause serious or fatal harm on SCP-5201:
* Abrahamic Holy objects
* Spices (i.e. salt, garlic, and vinegar)
* Sharpened Bamboo
* Whips created from the tails of stingrays
* Betel nut chew
* Urine

All entrances to SCP-5201 containment cells are to be guarded by at least two Level-2 personnel equipped with at least one object mentioned above. Since the effectiveness of these objects depends upon the individual&#39;s religious background or cultural knowledge, moderate psychological screening and seminars must be conducted first before assigning any personnel.

A specialized portable retinal scanner has been developed to identify SCP-5201 instances in the wild or among human groups in case of a containment breach, capable of immediately identifying retinal irregularities that have been known to be a trait of SCP-5201.

The severed lower torso of SCP-5201 instances can be retrieved for research and domestication or must be disabled for reproduction through sprinkling salt, smearing crushed garlic or ash on the top.

++ **Description:** 
&gt; 
SCP-5201 is an endemic and carnivorous subspecies of //Homo sapiens// that have inhabited the Philippines, known in local folklore and myths as the &#34;Manananggal&#34;. SCP-5201 was initially discovered during the 1500s by Foundation operatives embedded within the Spanish colonization parties. The Supernatural Committee of the Philippines declared SCP-5201 to be extinct in the wild in late April 1997.

Instances of SCP-5201 have been observed to exhibit a variety of anomalous abilities and characteristics, including:
* Full-body autotomy or the ability to segment itself, leaving behind its body from the waist downwards.
* Cellular transmogrification as an adaptation to blend with and infiltrate rural communities.
* Additional appendages such as interfemoral membranous wings for flight and tentacle-like organs for defense.
* Possession of an incredibly long and prehensile tongue capable of reaching lengths up to 20 meters.

SCP-5201 was the only known natural aphotic parthenogenetic mammalian species[[footnote]]Aphotic parthenogenetic organisms are organisms whose females are able to asexually reproduce via anomalous means.[[/footnote]]. SCP-5201 asexually reproduce between the 15th to 20th autotomic stage, during which the lower body regenerates its own upper torso via a process similar to epimorphic regeneration[[footnote]] Epimorphosis is defined as the regeneration of a specific part of an organism in a way that involves extensive cell proliferation of somatic stem cells, dedifferentiation, and reformation, as well as blastema formation. [[/footnote]] observed in autotomous lizards[[footnote]] Autotomy or self-amputation is the behavior whereby an animal sheds or discards one or more of its own appendages, usually as a self-defense mechanism to elude a predator&#39;s grasp or to distract the predator and thereby allow escape. [[/footnote]]. The severed upper torso of an SCP-5201 would then search for a compatible female human to consume and eventually attach itself to repeat the cycle.

++ **History:** 
&gt; 
The first recorded mention of SCP-5201 was by Spanish sailors in 1512. Between 1600 and 1900, SCP-5201 was hunted by various GoIs and other anomalous subhuman species also thriving at the time in the Philippines. Genetic testing from subfossil remains indicates that SCP-5201 is itself an invasive species to the Philippines, as determined using cross DNA testing from SCP-8871 and SCP-6993, which are also believed to be endemic with the country. The exact origin of SCP-5201 is unknown.

SCP-5201 achieved notorious and widespread recognition from Foundation researchers after some observed weaponization of domesticated instances during the Philippine-Xian War. Soon after that, Mobile Task Force Theta-4 (&#34;Folk Hunters&#34;) was formed to capture instances of SCP-5201, SCP-8871 and other anomalous subhuman species within the Philippines for Foundation research.

Site-144 has historically carried out unethical experimentation on indigenous populations of SCP-5201 to see how they experienced pain, and bodily fluids and internal organs were forcibly taken from juveniles. These experiments caused political conflict between the Supernatural Committee of the Philippines and the SCP Foundation, and a large number of early Foundation outposts from the country were decommissioned as a result.

&gt; //Our research team from Outpost Theta-8 at Capiz has been detained by people claiming to be officials from the Supernatural Committee.// 
&gt; 
&gt; //Even though most of our resources have been confiscated and our captive specimens released, these people have been friendly. Their leader, Paul Ortiz, was just asking us how were we able to operate so effectively without getting killed by these creatures.//

&gt; //I&#39;ve explained that we&#39;re an organization similar to their Committee, containing the anomalous, with the exception of operating at greater scope and age.//

&gt; +++ Conducting Research on Tribal SCP-5201 Communities
&gt; //October 15, 1709//
&gt; //Senior Researcher Albione Greene//
&gt;  
&gt; **ABSTRACT**
&gt; 
&gt; **Background:** When conducting research with SCP-5201 tribes, formal consent from the Supernatural Committee of the Philippines beyond the conventional institutional review board review is strictly needed for the potential adverse consequences at a community or governmental level that are unrecognized by Foundation researchers.
&gt; 
&gt; **Objectives:** In this article, we review sovereignty, research ethics, and data-sharing considerations when doing community-based participatory health–related or natural-resource–related research with SCP-5201 tribes and present a model material and data-sharing agreement that meets the Supernatural Committee of the Philippines&#39; requirements.
&gt; 
&gt; **Discussion:** Only the local communities themselves can identify potential adverse outcomes, and they can do this only if they understand the assumptions and methods of the proposed research. Tribes must be truly equal partners in study design, data collection, interpretation, and publication. Advances in the protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) are also applicable to IRB reviews, as are principles of sovereignty and indigenous rights, all of which affect data ownership and control.
&gt; 
&gt; **Conclusions:** Foundation researchers engaged in tribal 5201 projects should become familiar with all three areas: sovereignty, ethics, and informed consent, and IPR. We recommend developing an agreement with tribal partners that reflects both health-related IRB and natural-resource–related IPR considerations.

&gt; 
&gt; **THE SPECIES PROFILE**
&gt; The Species Profile is a document that provides the information that the SCP Foundation requires to assess the risk of importing the species into the United States. The Species Profile must demonstrate the scientific validity of the information by referencing published and peer-reviewed scientific literature. Where information in the scientific literature is lacking or uncertain, this should also be noted. The information required is listed below. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SUMMARY**
&gt; //Homo sapiens visceralis// is an anomalous and endemic subhuman species discovered within the Philippine archipelago. The species can be mostly found within Capiz on the Visayas region,  where 78 tribal communities recorded. Settlements of the species can be found mostly across all the major cities of the Philippines, either co-inhabiting with the Filipino people or as the widely accepted &#34;coverts&#34; (according to the Supernatural Committee of the Philippines).
&gt; 
&gt; The potential consequences of the species overseas and its ecological impact is mostly only posing as a strong invasive species, primarily due to its high reproductive, regenerative, and carnivorous nature and imminent preference to human infants as a source of nutrition. As of the moment, the likelihood of the species establishing in the United States may be high, so precautions are highly needed to prevent any potential outbreak.
&gt; 
&gt; **NAME AND TAXONOMY**
&gt; 
&gt; [Level-3 Clearance Required]

Between the late 1900s and early 2000s, outbreaks of SCP-5201 were reported all across the Philippines. Due to the risks of SCP-5201 reaching out to nearby countries and becoming an invasive species, a joint-operation was formed between the Supernatural Committee of the Philippines, the Global Occult Coalition and the SCP Foundation to exterminate SCP-5201 instances in the wild and permanently erase the species from public history. 

Later named Project Dipsy, the operation involved amnesticizing the major cities and towns of the country, funding various media and propaganda about SCP-5201 as a product of folklore and urban legends, and eventually domesticating the remaining populations that survived for cellular regeneration research.

&gt; **Message Body:**
&gt; 
&gt; //Director Blackwood,//
&gt; 
&gt; //It seems that we&#39;ve been right all along. SCP-5201 never went extinct in the wild, and we weren&#39;t the only ones that domesticated them.//
&gt; 
&gt; //According to my sources from the GOC, a large number of Philippine syndicates are now utilizing SCP-5201 for foreign flesh trades and human trafficking. Specifically, they&#39;ve been abducting girls and converting them into instances of SCP-5201. A few weeks ago, messengers from the Supernatural Committee reported an incident involving the Tatlong Kahoy syndicate, a political dynasty group known for trading in anomalous endemic organisms from the Philippines to countries like Russia and China. It seems the GOC has already taken action. They&#39;ve been shutting down the larger conversion camps and warehouses and terminating all SCP-5201 instances involved.//
&gt; 
&gt; //The Committee managed to rescue a few hundred children that are still half-way from the conversion, and they&#39;ll be sending them to us in the hopes that we&#39;ll be able to help these girls.//
&gt; 
&gt; //We&#39;re requesting backup from MTF Theta-4 in case these start getting out of hand. We all know that when the GOC is involved, it&#39;s always bad news.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Talk to you soon,//
