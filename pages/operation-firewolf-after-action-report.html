**Operation:** Firewolf

**Log Number:** 260200HOCT2021/5734

**Risk Classification:** Apolaki

**Foreword:** Firewolf was the codename for the offensive operation previously conducted against Hannad Atallah, a politician in Indanan, Sulu, who was implicated in the murders of his rivals in politics. The causes of death of the deceased victims were confirmed to be anomalous in nature, based on the autopsy reports provided by the NBI-Special Occurrences Unit. Assets from the OMNINT Division were instructed to gather intelligence on the subject&#39;s activities, to prove or disprove his innocence.

After days of surveillance, it was discovered that the subject has raised a private army of HDEIs[[footnote]] Highly Dangerous Extranormal Individuals [[/footnote]] and RFNs [[footnote]] Reclusive Folkloric Natives [[/footnote]] consisted of Type-718s[[footnote]] Kapre [[/footnote]], Type-720s [[footnote]] Tikbalang [[/footnote]] and Type-701s [[footnote]] Aswang [[/footnote]]. This prompted action from the Paranormal Combat Department to issue a scramble order to the Philippine Marine Corps&#39; Anomalous Warfare Battalion and deploy Oscar and Papa Company.

**Follow-Up Actions Taken:**
The recent surveillance operation conducted by OMNINT Division operatives revealed that Atallah has several properties across Mindanao and Luzon, specifically, in Angeles City, Pampanga. Elements of Oscar and Papa Company was deployed to pursue and apprehend (or eliminate, if possible) Atallah and neutralize his thaumaturgic private armed group, which officially earned a LAG[[footnote]] Lawless Anomalous Group[[/footnote]] status as designated by PCD and the Department of Supernatural Defense.

The offensive operation began in Barangay Bato-Bato, Indanan, in an isolated mansion located away from the rural area. The 4th SOP[[footnote]] Special Operations-capable Platoon [[/footnote]] of Oscar Company was assigned as the assault element in the raid, supported by the line elements of Oscar Company, the 3rd and 4th Platoon. Elements of Papa Company, specifically the 2nd and 5th Platoons were positioned as cordons around the operating area to act as security elements in roads and routes leading to the mansion to deter and prevent enemy reinforcements.

The target building is a two storey mansion surrounded by a withered garden. A garage housing several technicals[[footnote]] Civilian vehicles mounted with crew-served weapons.[[/footnote]] was located near the starboard side of the building. Vulture Drone surveillance feed revealed men in black and blue tactical clothing, and armed with an assortment of high powered firearms. Thermal imaging revealed heat signatures within the target building, presumed to be security elements masked within the target building itself.

&gt; -------------------------
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; 00.00.00 - SSgt John &#34;Delta&#34; Lopez, PN(M)&#39;s camera feed activated, revealing a squad of ten men and women aboard a 6x6 truck. The muzzles of their M16R4 rifles were pointed downward at the floor of the truck while tucked between their legs.
&gt; 
&gt; **Driver:** Sarge, we&#39;re here.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.00.59 - Delta&#39;s hands appeared in view as he made final adjustments to his equipment.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** We&#39;ll take it from here, Sarge. //(Gets up from seat)// Squad, form into column.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.01.23 - Everyone gave their affirmative replies as Delta began to disembark. Sgt. Fernando &#34;Fireball&#34; Paras, PN(M), the designated Assistant Squad Leader, began accounting the disembarking Marines after Delta had positioned himself at the rear of the truck to provide security.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Sarge, all ten men and women accounted for.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Aye, Sarge.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.01.49 - Both SL and ASL proceeded to follow the squad towards the gate of the compound. The property was enclosed, the height of the walls prevented observation from outside.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.02.10 - The pointman of the squad deployed a MPB (Multi-Purpose Buggy), which automatically activated on its own upon being set down on the ground. The squad&#39;s Buggy Operator manipulated the automaton towards the compound. It extended its torchlight to burn the lock and the surrounding grills which could become an obstruction in the squad&#39;s entry.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Squad, split up to two Fireteams. The Vultures detected heat signatures in places where there shouldn&#39;t be.
&gt; 
&gt; **Everyone:** Sarge, aye, Sarge.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.04.12 - As the lock fell off and the gate opened slightly inwards, Delta tapped the shoulder of the Marine in front of him, who in turn, tapped the Marine in front of him until it reached to the front.
&gt; 
&gt; **Pointman:** Coming in! //(Proceeds to rush inside)//
&gt; 
&gt; 00.05.34 - All Marines entered the compound. A group of humanoids suddenly materialized ahead of them, each were armed with Kalashnikov rifles.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Shit! Contact front! Squad, drop!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.06.45 - All Marines dropped to the ground as 7.62mm rounds flew overhead. The loud staccato burst of enemy weapons was heard in the video feed, as well as a low echoing cackle that originated from the direction of the OPFOR. The camera panned upwards; a man in black robes can be seen in the center, his hands were outstretched, revealing red skin. The hood of his robe revealed no face, only darkness.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Goddammit, an HDEI! AMP rounds, volume of fire!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.07.10 - The squad opened fire from prone position and hit several of the armed men. The surviving mercenaries turned towards the mansion and ran, leaving the robed man behind, who was still cackling.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** First fireteam, bounce up!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.07.24 - The first fireteam got onto their feet and began to catwalk towards the robed man while firing their weapon. The second fireteam remained in prone position, continuously providing suppression for the advancing first fireteam.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Drop! //(First FTM dropped at this point)// Second fireteam, bounce up!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.07.34 - The second fireteam bounced up and began to assault the robed man while first fireteam provided suppression from prone position. The man continued laughing as bullets penetrated his body, the grass beneath him was already soaked in red blood. The figure levitated a few inches off the ground before it spoke.
&gt; 
&gt; **Unidentified HDEI:** John Lopez...your surname sounded familiar. //(Pauses)// What was her name again? Clarice? I enjoyed ripping her apart!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.08.12 - Delta suddenly pulled out his blade and prepared to run towards the robed man when Fireball seized his leg, causing him to topple to the ground. Both Marines wrestled to submission.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Delta! Goddammit, Sarge! Focus!
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** That motherfucker, it&#39;s the HDEI who killed her! I could not believe he&#39;s now working for that piece of shit politician! I&#39;m gonna fucking kill him with my bare hands!
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Keep your shit together! She&#39;s not coming back. Compromising the mission will NOT bring her back, and you&#39;re going to walk in their line of fucking fire. Do you want your subordinates to face court martial just because they shot you by accident?
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** N-no, just-
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Goddammit, Delta. I know you&#39;re my senior and all, but you should have heeded my suggestion when I told you to pass this one up. You&#39;re clearly still not okay!
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** //(The robed man faded from view at this point)// Shit, where&#39;d he go?
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** We&#39;ll take care of him later. For now, the mission.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Aye. Second fireteam, drop! Redistribute ammo, weapons and equipment check search team, search and withdraw at 12 o&#39;clock!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.09.45 - Fireteam leaders stood from prone position and began distributing magazines to their subordinates before running back to their positions and assume prone once again. Marines second in the line shortly stood up to check their fellow Marines&#39; equipment before returning to position. After that, designated buddy teams broke rank to search the dead ahead, kicking away guns from the dead bodies&#39; reaches and making sure the corpses are truly dead before moving back to position.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.12.37 - Fireball stood up and ran a few meters ahead from the squad. The camera panned to reveal Marines rushing towards the assistant squad leader to be accounted before assuming a kneeling position, forming a circle. Delta shortly followed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** All ten men and women, accounted for!
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Column formation, move!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.13.28 - Second fireteam immediately broke rank and realigned vertically with each element separated only by a gap of five meters before advancing towards the target building.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** I don&#39;t know, Delta. I think it would be advisable if we go skirmisher or echelon on this one. If the bastards got a crew-served, they&#39;re going to mow us down!
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** You&#39;re right. //(Looks around, causing the camera to pan as well)// Squad, echelon right!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.14.12 - The squad immediately reformed before continuing their advance towards the target building.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.16.48 - The squad reached the door of the target building; the first fireteam positioned themselves at the left hand side of the door while two elements from the second fireteam broke rank. One of the Marines of the buddy team scanned the door as she and her fellow Marine carefully moved to the right hand side of the door. As soon as the buddy team finally stopped at their destination, the Marine, Sgt. Valerie &#34;Witch&#34; Danao, PN(M), reached for the doorknob.
&gt; 
&gt; **Witch:** Entrance, closed. //(Slowly turned the knob)// Buttonhook!
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** I got high!
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** I got low!
&gt; 
&gt; **Witch:** Move!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.17.40 - Witch nudged the door open. Both Fireball and Delta peeked around the doorframe with Fireball in standing position while Delta in kneeling position. Both Marines sighted the two guards standing in the middle of the living room and dropped them with carefully aimed shots. Shortly, other elements of the OPFOR appeared from cover and returned fire at the Marines, preventing them entry.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.18.25 - Delta pulled out a crowd control grenade. He primed it before rolling it inside the threshold of the living room. A loud bang was heard, followed by a discordant choir of cries.
&gt; 
&gt; **Unidentified Man:** Fuck! A tear gas! Retreat to the second floor!
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Living room, wide.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.19.31 - The squad entered the living room and aligned horizontally with a 3 meter gap and immediately sighted the moving silhouettes. They opened fire at the silhouettes; loud thuds were heard. First fireteam began to clear the starboard side of the living room while second fireteam, the portside. All clears were given before they consolidated at the first steps of the bifurcated staircase in front, which led to the second floor.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.20.28 - The video became shaky as the squad started to ascend the staircase. The robed man encountered earlier in //00.05.34// was seen passing through a wall before dematerializing. A cackling was suddenly heard, causing the entire squad to halt.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Second floor, wide.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** I don&#39;t like this. I don&#39;t like this at all.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.22.36 - The Marines began to secure the area but found no hostile entities. Delta moved closer to Fireball.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Where do you think did they hide? I mean the escapees, they&#39;re still around company-sized and I doubt we killed all of them back there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Expect the worse.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.23.45 - Just as Fireball ended his phrase, a shadow fell from the ground. It was a furred humanoid entity with elongated snout and decaying teeth. The face of the entity barely resembled that of a human, its eyes were bloodshot and its grey skin was both battered and scarred. More of its brethren dropped from the roof and landed among the Marines.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Fuck! Aswangs! Fall back, fall back!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.25.23 - Delta opened fire at the Aswang in front of him. The 5.56mm PES[[footnote]] Para-Energy Seekers[[/footnote]] round tore through the RFN, causing dark blood and other bodily fluids to pour out of its wounds. Fireball&#39;s rifle was heard firing at an unseen enemy in the background as the camera panned to another direction and revealed another Aswang with its clawed hand raised at a Marine on the ground. The camera lowered itself as Delta assumed kneeling firing position and dispensed lead at the RFN. Its jaws and neck was struck by bullets before falling on its side.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Get up, sarge!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.26.34 - Private Witch got to her feet and thanked Delta for assisting her. She quickly reached for her weapon and fired at an unseen target. Delta found another Aswang to neutralize and engaged it, hiting both its ribcage and abdomen.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.30.12 - A loud screech was heard, prompting Delta to turn at the direction of the sound. The camera pans and revealed Private Bolo with his blood-stained machete on the top of an Aswang, both of its arms were amputated. The Marine impaled it in the neck, silencing the RFN. 
&gt; 
&gt; 00.31.45 - Delta raised his aim at an Aswang approaching Cpl. Karlo &#34;Bolo&#34; Narag, PN(M) from behind. He catwalked towards the RFN while firing his weapon until it clicked empty. Every round that went through the Aswang caused it to stagger and screech. Delta reloaded tactically, discarding the empty magazine to the dump pouch while slamming in the new one. He pulled the charging handle and released it. He fired again until the RFN went down.
&gt; 
&gt; **PFC Ben &#34;Lighter&#34; Ticsay, PN(M):** All clear, sarge!
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Area is secured, but no signs of both the subject nor the other remaining PAG elements.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.35.21 - Delta fell quiet at the news. In the background, the robed man reappeared, only to disappear again.

The raid operation in Indanan yielded little results but information regarding Atallah&#39;s destination and current disposition at that time was gathered through confiscated electronic devices. It was later discovered that Atallah boarded a commercial cruise ship for transportation, bound to Pampanga. Theta Company attached to NORLUZCOM was notified of the development and was put on standby until Atallah&#39;s destination in Pampanga was determined.

Meanwhile, the 4th SOP of the Oscar Company, along with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Platoons were scrambled to perform a boarding action on the cruise ship, MV Maiden of the Pacific, a passenger ferry owned by [REDACTED] company. The raid operation on the ferry was initiated while it was docked for refuelling.

[[collapsible show=&#34;OPERATION VIDEO LOG 5734-2&#34; hide=&#34;-CLOSE&#34;]]
&gt; **Log:** 5734-2
&gt; 
&gt; **Subjects:** 1st Squad of 4th SOP
&gt; 
&gt; **Objectives:** Neutralization of the Atallah PAG and the apprehension of the subject himself.
&gt; 
&gt; **Parameters:** The elements of 4th SOP was aboard an F470 Zodiac Boat to conduct a ship boarding action and perform a raid at the sea vessel. Target subject was hiding in cabin 9C-812. Engagement is to be kept at minimal to prevent disturbance and civilian casualty in the execution of the operation.
&gt; ------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; 00.00.00 - Camera feed activated. Delta&#39;s hands were seen adjusting the straps of his chest rig and the sling of his rifle. It panned upwards and briefly revealed MV Maiden of the Pacific docked at the Bongao Port. PNP Maritime vessels were seen meters away from the area-of-operation, presumably maintaining security.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.01.02 - The vessel moved closer to the ferry. The camera panned behind and showed Fireball tinkering with a telescopic ladder. After the boat approaches, he deployed the ladder, attaching it to the upper deck&#39;s railings. Delta nodded at the direction of Fireball and the Marines began ship boarding action silently.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.02.34 - Delta was the first to board the ship. He reached the top of the ladder and vaulted over the railings. The loud thump of his fall made him pause and scan the immediate vicinity. He found himself close to the ship&#39;s accomodation but from the camera&#39;s view, there were no sailors inside, though the distant sound of electrohouse music can be heard. Delta stood up and glanced over the railings and motioned for the other Marines to hurry up. He assumed a kneeling position, keeping an eye out for anyone who might accidentally discover them.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.04.12 - Fireball was the second Marine to board the MV Maiden of the Pacific. His hushed counting was heard in the background as he began accounting his fellow Marines.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** All ten men and women accounted for, Sarge.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Non-lethal weapons for civilians.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Aye. //(Looks behind him)// Non-lethal for charlies, pass the word.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.06.27 - Delta gestured for the squad to proceed. He led them towards the end of the accomodation before halting.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Danger area, buddy teams.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Aye. Pass the word, buddy teams.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.07.26 - The warning reached the rear elements. Fireball tapped Delta&#39;s shoulder.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Security team, pass the word.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.08.12 - The designated security team, which was positioned at the rear of the squad, broke formation and ran across the deck with haste. They quickly secured the assembly area before gesturing at Delta.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Move!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.09.25 - Two by two, they crossed the deck with haste, rifles pointed upward. Fireball, after reaching the assembly area at the other side, began accounting the Marines in the squad until they are all accounted for. The squad assumed column formation once again before moving towards the stairs that led to the lower deck. The stairs led to a narrow hallway that ended in a T-hallway.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** T-hallway, run the rabbit.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** At your command.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.10.12 - Camera pans and revealed Witch and Bolo moving towards the edge of the right wall of the corridor. Delta and Fireball moved closer to the edge of the left.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Move!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.11.30 - Delta peeked around the corner in a kneeling position while Fireball moved towards the opposing wall and remained standing, his weapon aimed. Witch and Bolo mirrored their action.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Hallway clear.
&gt; 
&gt; **Witch:** Hallway clear.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Proceed.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.14.27 - Bolo took point, leading the entire squad to the right while Delta and Fireball remained in position to provide security. The last man of the squad tapped Fireball, who in turn tapped Delta, which prompted the latter two to join the squad as rear elements. They proceeded further the corridor.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Rooms, door closed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Ignore it, the target.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.15.30 - The corridor ended in an L-shaped corner leading to the left. Bolo and Witch inched closer to the edge of the corner.
&gt; 
&gt; **Witch:** I got high!
&gt; 
&gt; **Bolo:** Low!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.16.20 - The two paused before Bolo spoke.
&gt; 
&gt; **Bolo:** Move! //(The two peeked around the corner and paused)// Clear!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.17.19 - The squad proceeded around the corner and advanced. The sound of the electrohouse music being played in the recreational lounge was increasing in volume. The Marines continued across the corridor until they reached a staircase.
&gt; 
&gt; **Bolo:** Stairs.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.19.35 - Bolo and Witch slowly ascended the staircase with the squad, now divided into two fireteams. Delta flicked the safety of his weapon to semi as they reached the top of the stairs. He relaxed after seeing no enemies in sight.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Target, fourth door on the left, pass the word.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Aye, target is behind the fourth door on the left, pass the word.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.20.17 - As soon as the word is passed from rear to front, the squad proceeded carefully towards the door. They were already halfway to their destination at around //00.21.34// when the door of one of the rooms opened. The camera whirred behind and revealed a group of men in plain clothes. However, parts of their clothes were bulged.
&gt; 
&gt; **Man 1:** Fuck! We&#39;re followed!
&gt; 
&gt; **Man 2:** I&#39;ll employ the //barang//!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.22.10 - Delta did not hesitated as he opened fire at one of the men. His aim quickly jumped on the second one and downed him with three shots. One of them, the man presumed to be knowledgeable in the art of //barang//, ran back inside the room. The last surviving man of the group drew his weapon to cover the //mambabarang// and discharged a shot but widely missed. Fireball returned fire and eliminated him.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Fuck. Second fireteam, secure the target, move!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.23.28 - Delta and the rest of the first fireteam rushed inside the room. The //mambabarang// immediately vaulted over the bed beside the window port and jumped out. Delta attempted to follow but upon seeing the //mambabarang// with a straw doll in hand peeked back inside the room, he quickly dropped on his belly.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Marines, on your belly, now!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.25.45 - Two of the Marines managed to hit the deck on time but Private Victoriano &#34;Cyber&#34; Lastimosa, PN(M) was hit by the spell casted by the //mambabarang//. The Marine&#39;s chest rig blew outward as his skin suddenly turned green and foam forming at the corners of his mouth. He was convulsing violently as he fell to the ground.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Fuck! RTO, request for immediate med-evac! I&#39;ll chase that motherfucker!
&gt; 
&gt; **Edge:** Aye sir! //(Proceeded to use her radio)// Command, this is-
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Hey, wait for me! //(Stood up and followed after Delta)//
&gt; 
&gt; 00.27.23 - Delta jumped out of the window and landed on the deck of another corridor. The camera panned to briefly show Fireball jumping out of the window port where Delta came from. Delta and Fireball pursued the //mambabarang// towards a flight of stairs that leads back to the upper deck.
&gt; 
&gt; **Witch:** Sarge, this is Witch. The target&#39;s not here. I repeat, the target&#39;s not here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Aye, proceed to the link up point. We&#39;ll take it from here.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.28.12 - Delta and Fireball pursued the //mambabarang//, who ran towards the cabins. Civilians were seen loosely scattered at this point. A party appears to be ongoing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Ah fuck! We&#39;ve pierced the fucking Veil-
&gt; 
&gt; 00.29.30 - The //mambabarang// waved his straw doll at the Marines, who quickly rolled out of the way. Delta assumed a kneeling position and takes aim, but the //mambabarang// has already fled, last seen squeezing through a crowd.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Fuck this.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.31.28 - Delta sped across the deck, yelling at the crowd to disperse with Fireball in tow. The //mambabarang// was screaming and waving at an unseen person until Delta caught up and seized the target&#39;s legs. Both men rolled across the ground. Fireball approached with handcuffs.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Seems like our target&#39;s out on a party. //(Glanced at Fireball, who was restraining the target)// You take care of this bastard. I&#39;ll go and find Atallah. //(Raised the stock of his rifle and landed a blow at the temple of the mambabarang)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** What are you-hey get back here! Don&#39;t go alone!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.32.23 - Delta ignored Fireball&#39;s objections as he sped towards the entrance of the cabins. A gunfire was shot, which finally dispersed the crowd. Delta hit the deck, the camera panned from left to right as another shot rang out.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.35.26 - The Marine got to his feet and sprinted towards the entrance of the cabins. The crowd attempting to fit themselves inside the narrow door ran away at the sight of him. Delta kept his rifle pointing upwards as he yelled for the crowd to clear out. He entered the corridor where two men with small arms fire weapons stood waiting at the end of the corridor, prompting him to run towards the nearest door that was coincidentally left open.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.37.12 - Suppression fire was dispensed by the two men before stopping. Delta peeked around the doorframe and saw the gunmen retreating. He took aim and fired three shots, hitting one of them. He tilted the gun to check the ejection port, which was opened. He removed the magazine and replaced it with a fresh new one before pressing the bolt release. As soon as he was locked and loaded, he began to cross the hallway.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.39.49 - Footfalls and cursing were heard before Delta peeked around the corner, where a spiral staircase is. The remaining gunman was sprinting up the flight, but Delta opened fire at him, causing the man to roll back down to the deck. Delta wasted no time and ascended the staircase, wary of the traps or grenades that might be thrown his way. At this point, the music coming from the recreational lounge has become deafening.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.40.25 - Delta ascended the stairs. The Marine entered what appeared to be a dimly-lit ball hall illuminated by bright neon lights and spinning disco balls hanging in the ceiling. The lightings of the hall suddenly activated after the Marine reached the middle of the ball hall. The camera panned to the left and revealed the robed man encountered from the Indanan Raid, alongside a man[[footnote]] Confirmed to be Hannad Atallah [[/footnote]] in a //serwal//. Two oversized humanoid brutes flanked their either side; one sported a long hair while the other sported a mohawk. Another human in a suit and tie, presumably an HDEI, was standing behind Atallah.
&gt; 
&gt; **Robed Man:** Too bold of you to come here alone.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** You. //(Delta raised his rifle)// I&#39;ll give all of you ten seconds to surrender.
&gt; 
&gt; **Atallah:** Or what, soldier? What are you going to do?
&gt; 
&gt; 00.42.28 - Camera pans from left to right as Delta searched for something.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Did you just called me a &#39;soldier&#39;?
&gt; 
&gt; 00.43.30 - Silence.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** And to answer your question, I&#39;ll give you a war you&#39;ll never forget.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.46.27 - The sound of weapons being locked and loaded was heard. Delta turned around to see a group of armed men in civilian clothing. He swore as he glanced back at Atallah and his aides.
&gt; 
&gt; **Atallah:** You&#39;re really itching to be promoted //posthumously//, aren&#39;t you?
&gt; 
&gt; 00.47.12 - Delta fired an M616B grenade at Atallah and his group with the M203 grenade launcher attached to his M16R4 before dashing back to the staircase. Gunfire erupted from the armed men, followed by a series of screams. Delta burst out laughing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Fucking idiots, why would you fire your guns in front of your boss?
&gt; 
&gt; 00.48.21 - Delta fired at the armed men while frequently taking cover. Silhouettes were seen in the video feed, falling to the ground. The Marine then moved towards the right side of the entrance to fire at Atallah&#39;s group. The robed man from the Indanan Raid touched Atallah&#39;s shoulder and the duo disappeared, leaving the two //Kapre//s and the HDEI in suit and tie behind.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Delta, what the fuck was that?!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.50.16 - Delta whirled behind him and saw Fireball with a squad of Marines from 2nd Squad, Oscar Company. They halted behind the squad leader.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** I tried to stop them, they got away!
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** With all due respect, Sarge. You&#39;re a fucking idiot! Why&#39;d you go alone?!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.52.18 - The 1st Fireteam, 2nd Squad of Oscar Company lined up in a column behind Delta. A Marine tapped Delta&#39;s shoulder, who told the squad leader that he got high. Delta responded. Both Marines then peeked around the corner and dropped two men before withdrawing back to cover.
&gt; 
&gt; **Marine:** Autorifle, now!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.54.20 - A Marine Corporal armed with an M249 SAW moved near the pointman. He took aim at the remaining armed men and opened fire, mowing them down with 5.56mm ball rounds. The camera panned leftwards to reveal the two RFN and the HDEI now approaching, fully recovered from the blast of the M616B grenade.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Volume of fire at that //Kapre// with a mohawk, AMP[[footnote]] Anomalous Material Piercer[[/footnote]] rounds, move!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.55.52 - The Marines quickly switched their ammunition from ball to AMP. The sound of weapons being locked and loaded was heard. As soon as everyone is ready, they took aim at the targeted //Kapre// and concentrated their firepower at the RFN. The humanoid entity&#39;s stomach detonated after a hail of gunfire tore through it. It dropped to the ground. The second //Kapre// charged at them in anger, its tobacco freshly lit. With a lungful of inhalation, it exhaled at the Marines, who dove out of the way. Delta slid across the floor with his weapon aimed at the nape of the Kapre. He took aim and fired. The RFN roared as Delta breech loaded another M616B inside the M203 grenade launcher and fired at the RFN&#39;s neck. Upon detonation, the head of the entity flew away from its body.
&gt; 
&gt; 01.03.03 - The HDEI laughed as he reached for the insides of his tuxedo and retrieved an //aspis//, a medieval Greek shield. It glowed bright at the hands of the HDEI, who cocked back and thrust it at the direction of the Marines. Delta and the others quickly rolled out of the way. The HDEI charged at the fireteam again with the shield raised. As bullets hit the shield, it shimmered brightly in orange, gold and blue. The HDEI cocked back and slammed the shield at the face of a Marine. It exploded in a plume of red and sent shrapnel of bones everywhere. The headless corpse of the unfortunate Marine fell to the ground. Delta takes aim and fired.
&gt; 
&gt; 01.10.23 - Maniacal laugh escaped from the HDEI&#39;s throat as he whirled and shielded himself from Delta&#39;s attack. He then charged towards Delta, who pulled out his machete from its sheath and rolled to the side. The HDEI came too close; Delta swung and managed to amputate the right foot of the HDEI with the attack. The HDEI crashed onto the deck chest-first, screaming with a bloodcurdling tone. Delta raised his machete and struck the skull of the HDEI, quieting him forever.
&gt; 
&gt; 01.15.12 - Silence soon settled. Delta wordlessly sheathed his bolo and walked out of the ball hall.

&gt; 
&gt; 00.00.00 - Interrogator entered the room with a clipboard in hand. He walked towards the table where Ramon Akhtar was chained to.
&gt; 
&gt; **Veritas:** //(Tossed the clipboard on the table)// What&#39;s your deal? Why are you here? //(Interrogator occupied the steel chair in front of Akhtar)//
&gt;
&gt; **Akhtar:** I was just implicated. I&#39;m not related to Atallah-
&gt; 
&gt; **Veritas:** Then what do you call these? //(Pointed at the photographs of jars containing dead and live insects, alongside several other paraphernalias used in occultism)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Akhtar:** Listen, they planted those in my bag!
&gt; 
&gt; **Veritas:** Shut up, //mambabarang//. So you used to run assassination jobs for Atallah. You killed people from afar using rituals that we are already familiar in. You can&#39;t lie your way around that because we know, Akhtar.
&gt; 
&gt; **Akhtar:** What do you want?
&gt; 
&gt; **Veritas:** I was hoping you&#39;d be cooperative, Akhtar. I don&#39;t want to stain my hands red again like before. //(The interrogator cracked his knuckles while gazing straight in Akhtar&#39;s eyes. Subject was seen swatting parts of his body before screaming. Subject calmed down shortly, as if woken from a nightmare)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Akhtar:** W-what was that?!
&gt; 
&gt; **Veritas:** My question?
&gt; 
&gt; **Akhtar:** Question?
&gt; 
&gt; **Veritas:** My bad, I haven&#39;t asked any questions yet. I was hoping you could point us to the right direction. //(Veritas slammed both hands on the table and leaned closer to the subject)// Where will Atallah and his goons be in Angeles, Pampanga?
&gt; 
&gt; **Akhtar:** Isachar cursed the name of the place[[footnote]] The robed man encountered in Indanan Raid. He is capable of turning names into memetic cognitohazards. [[/footnote]] You could die if you heard it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Veritas:** //(Interrogator faced the closed circuit television camera and gestured at its operator. Visual feed suddenly distorted before returning back to normal)// Let&#39;s hear it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Akhtar:** They were in [REDACTED][[footnote]] For brevity, the location will be designated as &#34;Building-918&#34; in this document. [[/footnote]]. You&#39;ll know it by its red paint and pink lights.
&gt; 
&gt; **Veritas:** Hmm, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re cooperative, Akhtar. Hopefully, you&#39;re not going to fuck with us, like the first ones.
&gt; 
&gt; **Akhtar:** Where are they now?
&gt; 
&gt; **Veritas:** You came across the trapdoor back in the corridor, yes?
&gt; 
&gt; **Akhtar:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Veritas:** I&#39;ll let you use your imagination. //(Interrogator left the room)//
&gt; 
&gt; [END LOG]

After learning of Building-918&#39;s location, the 1st Squad of Oscar Company&#39;s 4th SOP was scrambled for rapid deployment. The target building was located in an abandoned compound vacated by its inhabitants several years ago after the &#34;Hydrochloric Scare&#34; of 2016[[footnote]] An incident involving the bombings of factories processing hydrochloride by eco-terrorists. Building-918 was located near one such factory.[[/footnote]]. It was a red building with three storeys, decorated with pink neon lights installed by the squatters, who were illegally operating it as a nightclub and a hub for narcotics dealers and their buyers.

Theta Company&#39;s 7th Squad was positioned around the area-of-operation as a security element with its 3rd Squad providing support with sniper and mortar assets, and reinforcements, if necessary. The Philippine Air Force&#39;s Paranormal Combat-capable Unit, the 13th Abnormal Operations Group (13th AOG) will be providing air assets in the form of Quick Strike Single-Entry Aircrafts (QSSEA)[[footnote]] Faster than light aircrafts capable of accurately eliminating ground targets with the use of ordinary or anomalous ammunitions. [[/footnote]] and Blackhawk Helicopters for inserting additional Marines in the area-of-operation.


[[collapsible show=&#34;OPERATION VIDEO LOG 5734-3&#34; hide=&#34;-CLOSE&#34;]]
&gt; **Log:** 5734-3
&gt; 
&gt; **Subjects:** 1st Squad of 4th SOP
&gt; 
&gt; **Objectives:** Neutralization of the Atallah PAG and the apprehension of the subject himself.
&gt; 
&gt; **Parameters:** The elements of 4th SOP will be deployed via 6x6 truck at the road leading to Building-918. Theta Company&#39;s 3rd Squad will be shadowing the SOP to provide support for increased chance of success.
&gt; 
&gt; ----------------------
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; 00.00.00 - Camera feed activated, revealing elements of 4th SOP&#39;s 1st Squad aboard the 6x6 truck. Delta&#39;s rifle was tucked between his legs, its muzzle facing down the floor of the vehicle. The camera pans from left to right, showing Marines sitting in the same manner.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Delta.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Yes?
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Your recent actions concerned me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** //(Laughs)// You don&#39;t have to. I&#39;m fine, always. I&#39;ve already gone through shit from Zamboanga to Marawi-
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** That&#39;s not what I am talking about. //(Pauses)// Your actions almost jeopardize both the mission and our juniors. Haven&#39;t you noticed, we had two casualties from the //Maiden//?
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** They knew what they&#39;ve signed up for, Sarge. Shit happens, and we&#39;re not just fighting against some jihadist Jim in the jungles like the line companies in the Landing Team Battalions. We&#39;re fighting against things that normally exist in the noosphere as nightmares.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Something tells me that you haven&#39;t gotten over your wife&#39;s death.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.02.58 - The camera panned towards Fireball&#39;s direction.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** What the fuck did you just say to me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Brother, I know this is not the appropriate time nor place to talk about this, but I think you should let go of it. It bothers you and we can see through that bravado you&#39;re trying to set up.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.03.12 - Silence.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** You can talk to me about it. //(Pause)// I know that this operation&#39;s personal because we&#39;re chasing after the targets, one of which happened to be your wife&#39;s killer, and what&#39;s worse is you&#39;re getting out of control. You&#39;re becoming a liability instead of an asset.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** //(Looks away)// What do you want to know?
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** I don&#39;t want to know anything. I just want you to //unload// the things that bother you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** I missed her, badly.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** //(Shifted in his seat)// Don&#39;t we all?
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** The WPS Campaign wore me out. I am tired, like the rest of them. Coming home and seeing her sweetest smile was the only thing I&#39;m looking forward to. And have I forgot to mention she&#39;s five months pregnant?
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** No.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** //(Low sob was heard)// I told her not to go that day. I told her to stay at home and spend time with me instead, but her duty calls. //(Whispers)// Duty calls. Duty.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.04.32 - Fireball extended his hand toward Delta but the Marine swatted it away.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** She still went to that CMO[[footnote]] Civil Military Operation [[/footnote]] to oversee the medical outreach program. Isachar was there, but he looked more like a soldier the last time I saw him than a cultist hippie in a robe. He&#39;s leading an anomalous weapons-capable CTG[[footnote]] Communist Terrorist Group [[/footnote]] in a raid for...well, they were scavenging for medical supplies.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** I heard about it. The encounter in Lanao del Sur.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** The bastard tore through Army soldiers like they were paper and the commies went trigger happy and killed everyone in sight. Clarice, he- //(At this point, Delta broke down)// the OMNINT asset, I was hoping that she&#39;s just bullshitting me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** What do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** My wife&#39;s death echo. If only you heard it, it&#39;s deafening. I don&#39;t know what happened and I don&#39;t want to imagine it. The operative told me that Isachar learned of Clarice&#39;s relation with me and decided to &#34;strip&#34; her piece by piece. I- //(Delta sobbed for a few more seconds)// I don&#39;t want to imagine it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Wherever she is, I am pretty sure she&#39;s in a happy place now. Madya-as, probably?
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** //(Paused)// You think Command will permit me to be assigned in Mahari-Likha?
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Don&#39;t even think about it. You&#39;re in an SOP, we&#39;re always in demand.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.07.12 - Delta raised his hand to object when the driver peeked from the cab.
&gt; 
&gt; **Driver:** Wake up, Marines. We&#39;re here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Oh shit, my camera&#39;s on already. Oh well- //(Delta was the first to disembark from the truck. He took position at the rear of the truck and knelt to provide security for the squad)//
&gt; 
&gt; 00.09.45 - After Fireball accounted the elements of the squad, he tapped Delta&#39;s shoulder, who took point this time. They rushed towards the target building where an armed guard was seen standing.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.10.23 - Delta held a fist up; the elements in the squad immediately took a knee and assumed cigarette formation. Delta stuck his index finger up and made a circle in the air before pointing at an alley near the target building. The squad immediately rushed towards the alley.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Edge, request for sniper support and tell them to take out the tango over there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Edge:** Aye, sarge. //(Pulls out her Baofeng radio)// Theta 3, this is Oscar 4-1, do you read me, over?
&gt; 
&gt; 00.11.06 - Silence. The sound of breathing from the elements were heard.
&gt; 
&gt; **Edge:** Theta 3, this is Oscar 4-1, I say again, do you read me, over?
&gt; 
&gt; **Theta 3:** Oscar 4-1, this is Theta 3, I read you loud and clear, over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Edge:** Theta 3, this is Oscar 4-1, request sniper support at my command, over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Theta 3:** Roger that. What&#39;s the Golf Charlie, over?
&gt; 
&gt; **Echo:** //(Moves away from the radio)// You got to be fucking kidding me, they&#39;re just literally across the street. //(Puts the radio near her mouth again)// Theta 3, this is Oscar 4-1, the Golf Charlie is shackle, sierra, alpha, lima, oscar, november, sierra, end shackle, over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Theta 3:** Target description?
&gt; 
&gt; **Echo:** //(Peeks around the corner)// One tango, plainclothes, presumably armed with small arms fire, non-anomalous.
&gt; 
&gt; **Theta 3:** Affirmative. Let the fireworks begin.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.13.23 - A loud thump was heard; the guard fell to the ground with a wet thump. Two Marines from the second fireteam rushed towards the dead and immediately carried the corpse out of view. After hiding the body, they quickly returned to the squad.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Littermen has returned to position.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.14.45 - Delta led the squad towards the entrance of the building. The second fireteam broke formation as they moved towards the other side of the door; each of them aiming and scanning at the closed door of the building. Synthwave was audibly heard playing in the background.
&gt; 
&gt; **Bolo:** Entrance, closed. //(Reached for the knob)// Buttonhook.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** I got low.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** I got high!
&gt; 
&gt; **Bolo:** //(Proceeds to open the door)// Move!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.15.43 - Delta assumed kneeling position while Fireball remained standing. Both Marines sighted an armed guard at the end of the corridor. They opened fire simultaneously, dropping their target. However, screams were heard as the other guards presumably saw their companion fall.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Fuck, contact front! First fireteam, to me! Second fireteam, the door to the left!
&gt; 
&gt; **Bolo:** Aye, sarge! //(Proceeded towards the door on the left side of the corridor. The second fireteam assembled near the door in a column formation with Bolo as the pointman. He carefully walked to the other side of the door with rifle still aimed while Witch kept her aim at the door itself. Bolo reached for the knob)// Buttonhook!
&gt; 
&gt; **Witch:** //(Pulled out a crowd control grenade and primed it)// Buttonhook.
&gt; 
&gt; **Bolo:** Move! //(Proceeded to open it)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Witch:** //(Tossed the grenade inside. Bolo closed it once more; after the grenade detonated, they breached through the door. Gunfire was heard several times)// Clear! Coming out!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.17.08 - Meanwhile, the first fireteam led by Delta moved towards the right wall of the corridor. It ended in a concourse where a bar, some chairs, a turntable and a pair of loud speakers were set up. Three armed men were seen behind a flipped table.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Volume of fire at eight o&#39;clock!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.18.00 - The first fireteam opened fire at the table. 5.56mm and 7.62mm rounds fired from M249, M14 and M16R4s tore through the cover and killed the armed men behind it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Unidentified Man:** We better call the &#34;Stallion&#34;! They&#39;re coming close!
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Tango, around the corner.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.20.24 - The second fireteam rejoined the first fireteam. Delta and Fireball moved towards the edge of the corner of the wall.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** I got low.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** I got high.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Move!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.21.34 - Both Marines revealed themselves from cover and opened fire at the two guards around the corner. The squad assembled near the staircase and prepared to ascend when the windows behind them suddenly broke. Glass fragments flew in the air and the neighing of horses were heard.
&gt; 
&gt; **Witch:** Contact, rear!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.23.45 - The Marines whirled behind and saw the newcomers. A pair of horses with humanoid torsos slowly stood up on their legs. The //Tikbalang//s neighed loudly as another one arrived and halted behind them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tikabalang 1:** We&#39;re already apologizing for what we are about to do, ladies and gentlemen. No hard feelings, only business.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Wedge formation, autoriflemen, concentrate on one RFN at a time, move!
&gt; 
&gt; **Tikbalang 2:** Ha, they even gave us a cool nickname.
&gt; 
&gt; **Tikbalang 1:** I don&#39;t know, but I kinda prefer the SCP something. What number did they gave us again?
&gt; 
&gt; **Tikbalang 3:** By Sitan&#39;s balls, focus you two! They&#39;re going to utterly fuck our shit up!
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** AMP, volume of fire!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.30.21 - The autoriflemen fired upon the Tikbalang on the left while the rest concentrated their gunfire at the RFNs in front of them. The Tikbalangs attempted to evade the bullets but ended up getting hit. The Tikbalang targeted by the autoriflemen was shredded by gunfire; this had caused the other Tikbalang to go berserk as it snatched one of the Marines by his neck and raised him up in the air.
&gt; 
&gt; **Bolo:** Chicken! //(Draws machete)// Get your dirty hands off him! //(Bolo advanced towards the Tikbalang and impaled the RFN with his machete while whispering an esoteric prayer to Bathala)//
&gt; 
&gt; 00.32.23 - The Tikbalang released its grip and dropped Chicken to the ground. It applied pressure on its stomach, attempting to keep its own intestines from spilling out. Bolo approached the Tikbalang and decapitated it with a single blow on the neck.
&gt; 
&gt; **Chicken:** Bolo, get down! //(Takes aim with his M249)//
&gt; 
&gt; 00.35.25 - Bolo did what he was told and the Marine opened fire at the last Tikbalang sprinting towards his companion. Chicken&#39;s ammunition belt suddenly ran out; the Tikbalang was still standing, albeit staggering. He turned towards Witch and yelled.
&gt; 
&gt; **Chicken:** I&#39;m out!
&gt; 
&gt; **Witch:** Catch this! //(Threw a magazine of 5.56mm at Chicken, who caught it with a single hand)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Chicken:** //(Inserted the magazine into the ejection port of the M249 before taking aim)// OORAHH! //(Proceeded to open fire at the Tikbalang until it stopped moving and fell)//
&gt; 
&gt; 00.40.12 - Silence shortly ensued. The speakers, now broken in the fighting, were continuously blurting out distorted noise.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** You know the drill.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.41.23 - The Fireteam Leaders proceeded to redistribute ammos to their subordinates; designated search teams checked the corpses to ensure they were dead; equipment were checked and everyone assembled near the staircase.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Let&#39;s move!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.45.12 - The squad ascended to the second floor. The camera pans from left to right, revealing a corridor with no doors. The walls were covered with mirror and not a soul, with the exception of the figure in a cross-sitting position in the middle of the hallway with its back facing them, can be seen in sight. The squad approached the figure cautiously. The head of the person suddenly lifted up, revealing it to be covered by a hood.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Not another movement! //(The figure visibly tensed up)// Hands where I can see them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Unidentified Person:** What do you see every time you looked into the mirror, John?
&gt; 
&gt; 00.46.12 - Delta halted; he kept his rifle aimed as the figure stands up and turned.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Not another step closer! Get down on the ground, now!
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Wait, how&#39;d you know my name?
&gt; 
&gt; **Unidentified Person:** She told me.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.47.43 - The figure threw off its hood, revealing an angelic face of a young woman. She pointed at the mirror where an ectomorphic entity in a stained and tattered lab gown can be seen standing in complete silence. The feminine entity&#39;s face was in an advanced state of decay.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** C-Clarice? No fucking way.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Delta, snap out of it! The bastard&#39;s trying to fuck with you, wake-ARGH! //(Fireball was thrown a few meters away by an unseen force. The reflection of the ectomorphic can be seen near Fireball. It proceeded to move towards another Marine, who was suddenly flung away by an invisible force)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Shit! //(Glanced at the HDEI)// Hey, get back here!
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Delta, how about you help us here first?
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Wh-what the hell am I supposed to do?!
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** I don&#39;t know?! //(Ducks to evade Bolo, whose body was thrown across the corridor)// It&#39;s the ghost of your wife, maybe you can calm her or something?!
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** //(Removed the backpack from his back, unzipped it, and began searching for magazines inside)// Spectral Reactive Rounds, perfect!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.51.34 - Delta quickly removed the magazine of 5.56mm AMPs currently fed into his rifle. He slammed the magazine filled with 5.56mm SRRs into his M16R4 and pulled the charging handle to load it. The Marine rushed towards the commotion, occasionally looking at the mirrors on the wall as a reference.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Target sighted!
&gt; 
&gt; 00.52.13 - Delta saw the reflection of the ectomorphic entity standing over Witch. Shards of glass can be seen floating above her. The female Marine turned to crawl on her belly as she attempts to escape the ghost about to kill her. Delta screamed as he opened fire at the ectomorphic entity.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.53.26 - The ghost let out a bloodcurdling scream, which sent Delta on his knees. His hands went to his ears as he tried to block the noise. Shortly, the ghost disappeared.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Her death echo.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.56.23 - Delta fell quiet. The Marines shortly recovered and immediately formed up in a column. The camera panned towards the direction of the staircase leading to the third floor. He stood up and approached his backpack on the ground. He zipped it close and slung it on his back.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Let&#39;s get this over with.
&gt; 
&gt; 01.01.23 - The squad ascended to the third floor. There, a handful of armed men hiding behind flipped chairs and tables can be seen, protecting Atallah, Isachar, and the unidentified woman encountered earlier. Like the second floor, sections of the walls were covered in mirror.
&gt; 
&gt; **Atallah:** So, everything leads here-
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** I&#39;m done hearing your shitty one liners. //(Raises rifle)// Squad, echelon left!
&gt; 
&gt; 01.01.45 - The squad immediately formed up in echelon left, their weapons aimed at the OPFOR.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Drop, volume of fire! //(Glanced at the direction of the squad&#39;s RTO)// Edge, request sniper fire!
&gt; 
&gt; **Edge:** Aye, sarge! //(Pulls out her radio)// Request sniper support-
&gt; 
&gt; 01.05.23 - Atallah, Isachar, and the woman took cover behind a flipped table. The Marines busily eliminated Atallah&#39;s private armed group while supported by the snipers of Theta Company. As the last of the hired guns fell dead, silence ensued. First squad got to their feet and formed in a semi-circle, rifles aimed at the direction of Atallah, Isachar and the HDEI.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Don&#39;t make this any harder for us.
&gt; 
&gt; **Atallah:** &#34;Make this any harder&#34;? You&#39;re going to kill us if we surrender!
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Not far from the truth. //(Takes aim and fire)//
&gt; 
&gt; 01.06.32 - The round managed to graze Atallah&#39;s shoulder as Isachar pulled him to safety. The HDEI disappeared to engaged the Marines alongside the unidentified woman. Elements of the 1st Squad started flying as the ectomorphic entity controlled by the female HDEI began attacking. Delta whirled at the direction of the ghost using a mirror on his left as reference and eliminated the entity with a short burst until his rifle clicked empty. Facing the female HDEI, he pulled out his Colt .45 and let loose a series of rounds, emptying it at her body.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Reloading, need cover! //(Delta proceeded to discard the magazine of his M16R4 to the dump pouch attached to his suspender and slammed a magazine filled with PES rounds)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** Isachar&#39;s on your left!
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** //(Whirled, the HDEI materialized like an apparition)// You! //(Delta sent the stock of his rifle at the face of the HDEI)//
&gt; 
&gt; 01.12.45 - Isachar was hit on the left forehead, causing the HDEI to swear. It pulled out a curved knife from his robe and swung it at the direction of the Marine. Delta rolled backwards and fired a short burst at the HDEI, sending him sliding across the floor. Isachar laughed as he picked himself off the ground and disappeared shortly.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** Fireball, go secure Atallah. This fight is mine, mine alone.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** And leave you behind? No!
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** This is personal, Fernando. Now, go.
&gt; 
&gt; 01.13.34 - Fireball reluctantly complied as he called the squad to surround Atallah. Meanwhile, Isachar reappeared behind Delta with a Kalashnikov. Delta heard his movement and immediately rolled out of the way as the HDEI opened fire. Delta returned fire, hitting the HDEI in the knee before he disappeared once again.
&gt; 
&gt; 01.15.32 - The Marine drew out his K-Bar and thrust behind him. The tip of his blade pierced through his skin and windpipe. Isachar froze on the spot as the blade of the knife entered his throat. He choked as blood began to fill his lung sacs, his grip on his own knife loosened until it fell on the floor with a clatter.
&gt; 
&gt; **Delta:** That&#39;s not enough. I wish I could do much worse.
&gt; 
&gt; 01.20.23 - The HDEI fell to the ground, twitching. Delta takes aim and fired at pointblank range. The Marine simply stared at Isachar&#39;s corpse for a long time before the elements of 1st Squad approaches with Atallah in tow.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fireball:** It&#39;s over.
&gt; 
&gt; 01.21.46 - As the Marines escorted the restrained Atallah out of the room, the camera panned at the location where Isachar&#39;s body was supposed to be, only to reveal a pool of blood, his corpse nowhere to be seen.
&gt;

The apprehension of Atallah concluded the operation. The PAG he controlled was neutralized and the subject himself was terminated via lethal injection on 251200HOCT2027. SSgt. John &#34;Delta&#34; Lopez, PN(M) requested to be transferred out of Oscar Company&#39;s 4th SOP. It was first denied by 1st Lt. Bartolomew &#34;Bayawak&#34; Ando, PN(M), but Col. &#34;Omega&#34;, PN(M) overruled 1st Lt. Ando&#39;s decision and reassigned SSgt. John &#34;Delta&#34; Lopez, PN(M) to Beta Company, the unit currently in charge of security in and around the borders of the Rajahnate of Mahari-Likha in Pangasinan.

The search for Isachar, now labelled as ATCD/HDEI-942, was ongoing.
