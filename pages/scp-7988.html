    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-7988

**Object Class:** Euclid


**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7988 is to be kept alive inside the current class D host in a 14by14 foot room resembling an apartment building at all times. The current host it to not be informed of SCP-7988 in their system as in previous hosts it caused much discomfort and distress leading to the host committing suicide. Instead the host shall be surgically blinded and have their nerves destroyed so they can not feel or see SCP-7988. The host will be given a cover story that they had an aneurysm and that the nerve and sight loss are due to it.



**Description:** SCP-7988 is a 90 foot long 2 micro meters wide parasite of the genus Taenia. It has a very low opacity almost invisible to the human eye. It enters a human host through any available orifice that is large enough to fit in. Once entered in the human host it will wrap itself around every available organ and line the inside of every vein it can as a way to traverse the human host&#39;s body. It is not clear why it hosts other organisms; it does not appear to take nutrients from its hosts. The current hypothesis is it is looking for a human where it can live its life without concern. 


SCP-7988 will always have its tail outside a small orifice in the finger resembling a “hangnail” as an always open escape route. When pressure is applied to SCP-7988 it will become highly agitated and begin to constrict organs and block the blood flow of arteries in response to being attacked. After the host goes into cardiac arrest SCP-7988 will proceed to exit the host&#39;s body and line its surrounding till a new host comes near and it latches into the unsuspecting prey.

SCP-7988 age is unknown; there are no other confirmed events correlated to it and is believed to be the only one of its species.</textarea></pre>
