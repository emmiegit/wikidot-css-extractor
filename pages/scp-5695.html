**Item #:** SCP-5695

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5695 is available for use by any member of personnel upon request. Usage of SCP-5695 is to be recorded in the Experiment Log for the sake of posterity. At least one instance of SCP-5695 is to be kept in existence at all times.

**Description:** SCP-5695 is a figurine formed of milk chocolate, superficially resembling a common goldfish. When SCP-5695 is placed into a body of water, all aquatic organisms in that body of water will become additional instances of SCP-5695, regardless of the size of the area involved. All additional instances of SCP-5695 demonstrate the same anomalous properties.

SCP-5695 has been described as extremely pleasing to the palate, exhibiting a smooth texture that nonetheless holds a distinctive structure when pressed against the tongue. Although most chocolate is considered to be an indulgence, popular consensus is that SCP-5695 can be consumed at any time of the day with no ill effects. Analysis of SCP-5695&#39;s components has been ineffective in proving or disproving this belief.

**Discovery:** SCP-5695 was discovered in a cabin owned by amateur chef Arnold Grussman after passing hikers complained of a foul smell emanating from the building. Upon investigation by local authorities, the body of Mr. Grussman was discovered[[footnote]] Cause of death determined as autocannibalistic puncture of the jugular. [[/footnote]]  along with SCP-5695 itself.

The Foundation became involved with this case after it became apparent that, at some point prior to the body&#39;s discovery, all fish in the nearby Lake Gray had become instances of SCP-5695.

**Experiment Log 5695-1:**

In order to test the limits of SCP-5695&#39;s conversion properties, a series of experiments were undertaken. All tests were undertaken by placing SCP-5695 into a body of water and observing the results.

&gt; **Body of Water:** Small tank.
&gt; **Item:** One goldfish.
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** Goldfish became an additional instance of SCP-5695.

&gt; **Body of Water:** Small tank.
&gt; **Item:** Two starfish.
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** Starfish became additional instances of SCP-5695.

&gt; **Body of Water:** Large tank.
&gt; **Item:** Four Mallard ducks.
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** None.

&gt; **Body of Water:** Large tank.
&gt; **Item:** Six dolphins.
&gt;  
&gt; **Result:** Dolphins became additional instances of SCP-5695.
&gt; 
&gt; //Interesting. A dolphin is a mammal, not a fish, yet SCP-5695 converted it all the same. What kind of criteria does it use? Not that I&#39;m complaining, with how tasty the things are!// - Dr. Grade.

&gt; **Body of Water:** Large tank.
&gt; **Item:** Twelve dolphins.
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** None.
&gt; 
&gt; //Disappointing.// - Dr. Grade.

&gt; **Body of Water:** Lake St. James, Massachusetts
&gt; **Item:** All fish present.
&gt; 
&gt; **Result:** All fish converted into instances of SCP-5695.
&gt; 
&gt; //I would say this proves there&#39;s no distance limit on SCP-5695&#39;s conversion. Imagine the returns if we hadn&#39;t blocked off the river beforehand!// - Dr. Grade.

**Addendum 5695-1 (Freeze on Testing)**

&gt; //Last night, our security system detected Junior Researcher Darnell attempting to smuggle an SCP-5695 instance out of the Site. As if that weren&#39;t bad enough, under interrogation he kindly informed me that this is something the SCP-5695 research staff have been doing quite a bit.//
&gt; 
&gt; //I hope I don&#39;t have to say how appalled I am. All of you, expect to be summoned to a formal inquiry within the next few days. None of you are to leave Site-37 until then.//
&gt; 
&gt; Director Fitzpatrick

On 12/06/2019, during a meeting with senior site staff regarding recent containment breaches, Director Fitzpatrick suddenly fell from his seat and began spasming wildly while gasping for breath. 

Several seconds later, Director Fitzpatrick&#39;s entire body was transfigured into a statue of milk chocolate, save for his eyes, which continued to follow personnel around the room. Witnesses described said eyes as delicious.
