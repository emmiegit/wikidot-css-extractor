**ITEM #:** SCP-7701

**Object Class:** Pending

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7701 is currently uncontained. However, the frequency of SCP-7701 can be reduced via embedded Foundation Personnel in Government, Charitable, and International Organizations promoting the rapid disposal and proper caretaking of Corpses. 

**Description:** SCP-7701 is a Consciousness Transfer anomaly originating from the Russo-Ukrainian War. The anomalous effect is the transfer of a homocided Individual&#39;s Consciousness into their killer&#39;s body which results in the creation of an SCP-7701-2 instance.

SCP-7701-2 Instances are extremely hostile and aggressive, unwilling to hold down any conversation due to a &#34;berserker&#34; like rage which causes them to disregard any danger to their possessed form. They unilaterally attempt to kill the Friends, Acquaintances, and Family of their killer&#39;s possessed body. It is currently unknown what happens to the Original Homocider&#39;s Consciousness after they are possessed by an SCP-7701-2 Instance. As per ADDENDUM A Instances seem to posses both their own memories, and the memories of their killer which allows them to easily infiltrate and find their targets. 

These anomalous effects are induced via a Deceased Individual&#39;s Corpse exposure to rituals   preformed by an unknown GOI. See Addendum A, and &#34;Translated Wagner Group debrief of first contact with SCP-7701 GOI&#34; for information on the mechanism of how the anomaly manifests.  


**ADDENDUM A:** Discovery

An SCP-7701-02 Instance was first discovered on June ██ 2022 by Foundation Agents embedded within the Armed Forces of Ukraine ██ miles of Kharkiv. Foundation Agent codenamed &#34;Seerling&#34; who is an Commissioned Officer in the (expunged) Regiment overseeing Signaler Operations, overheard on radio that Ukrainian Soldiers have detained one of of their own Drone Operators after he inexplicitly lost his sanity and began to open fire and kill his entire Squad who he has been Friends with for years. The instance was captured after being mortally wounded by gunfire which caused motor functions in his Legs and Arms to cease. Upon hearing this Agent Seerling  immediately responded with the First responding Medics sent to the scene. Agent Seerling convinced the medics to focus on healing the captured shooter before anyone else under the guise of &#34;A captured Russian Infiltrator has massive Intelligence value and needs to be interrogated.&#34; In spite of his disabled motor functions the Instance was in such a rage and struggled against medical treatment constantly screaming that he &#34;Will kill as many Traitorous Ukrainian Dogs as possible for killing himself and his Friends.&#34; no matter what Agent Seerling attempted to ask of him he would repeatably scream the aforementioned statement, or just &#34;Die&#34; and other enraged screaming. The Medics were then given permission to sedate the Instance where he shortly after expired due to dozens of severe gunshot wounds causing overwhelming blood loss of 80% which is double the normally instant fatal levels of 40%. This incident was then immediately afterwards reported to Foundation Investigative Agents as a near certain occurrence of Anomalous activity.  


**ADDENDUM B:** Prior unconfirmed reports 

Foundation Agents embedded within The Armed Forces of Ukraine, The Russian Armed Forces, The Internationally Unrecognized Luhansk and Donbass People&#39;s Republic Militia&#39;s all reported an Urban Legend among Frontline Soldiers in Trenches that on extraordinary extremely rare occasions fellow Soldiers would suddenly turn on their comrades for no reason and try to kill as many as possible before they are put down. Some scattered reports from all aforementioned sides confirmed instances of &#34;Mental Breakdowns&#34; or &#34;Enemy Infiltration/Sleeper Agent Units&#34; causing Friendly Fire incidents that were resolved lethally in friendly combatant combat. Approximately 10 of these reports exist prior to events of Addendum A. The earliest report came from the Russians in Late March 2022, and Foundation Supervisors of Investigative Field agents marked these reports as &#34;Possible Anomalous Events&#34; in Early May 2022. Embedded agents were instructed to be on the lookout and directly investigate any of these incidents. 


**ADDENDUM C:** Foundation Response Prior to SCP Designation on ██/██/2022

Investigative Field Agents confirmed several SCP-7701-02 instances since Addendum A and before MTF Quebec-17 After Action Report. Summaries are pending further investigation and review. 

Formation of Provisional Mobile Task Force Unit Quebec-17 &#34;The War Reporters&#34;:    

Researcher&#39;s with Investigative Journalism or Forensic Investigation experience began to be attached with various Embedded Agents under the guise of &#34;Aggressively Reporting on the Conflict.&#34; or &#34;Investigating Instances of War Crimes.&#34; They would follow Agents into the aftermath of SCP-7701-02 instances and investigate. A breakthrough happened on ██/██/2022 when Agents embedded within the Wagner Group and MTF Quebec-17 Specialists within Russian State Media were in the attendance of an After Action Debrief detailing that Wagner Mercenaries preforming a deep flanking manevour decided to set up a bivouac shelter in a small forest cave to avoid drone patrols. Open entering the cave the first individuals of SCP-7701 GOI were seen burning corpses of Soldiers from both sides. 


**Translated Wagner Group debrief of first contact with SCP-7701 GOI:**

Note: Combat debrief of mission before and after contact with SCP-7701 has been removed due to not having any pertinent information regarding the anomaly. The only prior knowledge MTF Quebec-17 had was radio communications that the unit executed non combatants &#34;preforming a demonic ritual&#34; and was requesting immediate withdrawal, which they received after travelling to the pickup point.  

[BEGIN LOG]

**Sergeant Volkov:** On the third night of our flanking manevour the (pause) incident with a group of what I assume were insane satanists or necrophiliacs. We needed to rest for the night and the Ukrainians had constant drone patrols trying to look for us. There was a small cave we decided to go into. Upon entering the cave there was a large burning fire with all these devil worshipping symbols and robed men surrounding it. They were chanting in some foreign language. I (pause) I&#39;ll let Alekhin explain now.

**Junior Sergeant Alekhin:** I remember Volkov screaming at these &#34;things&#34; what the hell are they doing. One of &#34;it&#34; came up and told us that we are fated to join them in &#34;enforcing the primordial truth&#34;. These sick animals were cutting up a human corpse, painting demon symbols on it, and throwing pieces of it into the fire. The unhuman cultist leader said they are going to give a physical form to the rage of &#34;crack&#34; whatever the hell that means in their animal minds and the others were whispering some demon worshipping gibberish. The only thing they succeeded in was driving me to rage, as I instantly snapped and just shot all of them dead. Some things do not even deserve to live. I take full responsibility and blame for any fault of the mission failure. All I say was after that we did not want to go and engage the Ukies and just wanted some time to to process this nonsensical event. 

**Captain Vasiliev:** Are you certain you are telling me the truth about some Ukrainian Satanists preforming rituals on corpses or are you telling a tall tale to justify your withdrawal?

**Sergeant Volkov:** Yes Sir, we then made a radio call and requested exfiltration immediately after that at 0212 hours. We did complete our primary objective of determining enemy backline positions. We just couldn&#39;t preform our assault of the flanks of the Trench Line early morning. We just couldn&#39;t sleep in that cave, and their drones were searching for our exact position. I have valid reasoning to deduce we could not find a safe resting spot with half a dozen drones looking for us in this forest. We were probably going to be found which would ruin the required element of surprise for a successful assault. So we radioed for exfiltration and then force marched 11km to the pickup point. 

**Captain Vasiliev:** What coordinates was this cave at?

**Sergeant Volkov:**  I do not have exact location but when we requested exfiltration after walking a few minutes we were at (Expunged). 

**Captain Vasiliev:** Assuming your claims are actually true we need to take photos and video of this, just imagine the propaganda value of Ukrainian Satanists doing rituals on corpses of Innocent Civilians and Russian Soldiers! This would galvanize the public back home to support a full blown War on these Traitors to the Motherland! 

**MTF Quebec-17 #67:** Captain apologies for interrupting but I have expertise in this subject.

**Captain Vasiliev:** Yes that is why I allowed you access to this debrief at the request of (Redacted). He told me you State Journalism super stars would eat this stuff up. But with all due respect what can you even accomplish?  We are ██ kilometers from those coordinates. That is too deep behind enemy lines to risk yourself.  

**MTF Quebec-17 #67:** (Redacted) has someone responsible for secretly communicating with our spies. We can send a team with portable cameras to record that cave and then they will send this individual their recordings. Can I leave this briefing to go speak with (Redacted) so we can expose these Neo Nazi Satanists?

**Captain Vasiliev:** Yes you may leave to your Business!

**MTF Quebec-17 #67:** Thank you Captain, just be forewarned that this will most certainly go up to High Command and we will need to temporarily suspend operations in that general area as our spies move in. 

**Captain Vasiliev:** Understood (MTF Quebec-17 #67), hopefully this may be something above my rank at this point! Best of luck!

[END LOG] 

After the debrief MTF Quebec-17 #67 contacted other units of Quebec-17 nearest to the coordinates. It was decided that an instant response was that best call in this situation as there was a scene of evidence lying around that had to be investigated with utmost haste. Three units of MTF Quebec-17 who were in contact with a Foundation asset who held command of Local Ukrainian Special Forces from the (Expunged) Regiment. During Midday MTF Quebec-17 formed into a makeshift squad designated as team Lead Alpha-1, and supporters Alpha-2, and Alpha-3. 


**Addendum D:** Formal SCP Classification

**MTF Quebec-17 After Action Report:**
**Interviewer:** Dr. Schneider
**Interviewee:** MTF Quebec-17 Alpha-2
 
[BEGIN LOG]

**Dr. Schneider:** Recall the events of yesterday to the best of your knowledge. 
    
**Alpha-2:** (Sigh) We went via helicopter with Ukrainian Special Forces to investigate that cave of the Cult we got a report about by 67. We arrived around noon at the coordinates and swept the perimeter for I think half an hour before we found the entrance to the cave. We told the Ukrainians to stay outside as we searched the cave for evidence for the War Crimes case.  

**Dr. Schneider:** What equipment did you bring?

**Alpha-2:** Without hindsight we brought just our Forensic Equipment to that cave.

**Dr. Schneider:** What line of thinking lead to you just bring Forensic Equipment?

**Alpha-2:** We were just Forensic Researchers, we didn&#39;t have any combat training, the threat seemed already neutralized by the Wagner Mercenaries, and we had an armed escort anyways. We thought we would just spend a few hours taking pictures and samples just like any crime scene. 

**Dr. Schneider:** Describe what happened upon entering the cave.

**Alpha-2:** Everything was as expected, we saw the Thaumatological symbols and all the dead bodies of the GOI members. The Fire was completely extinguished at this point. We began to use our equipment to investigate the scene when... when... (pause)

**Dr. Schneider:** Relax and explain, if you need to see the therapist again it is fine we can do this another day. 

**Alpha-2:** No, no it is (sigh) fine I can continue (Deep Breathing). The symbols lit up in fire, all of a sudden more of these dash three instances suddenly manifested all around us screaming and wailing that they must be freed at any cost. They began to grab Alpha-1 She was placed on a Sacrificial Table where this flaming knife stabbed her through the Heart. I-I-I physically couldn&#39;t move I think there was a damn memetic agent affecting me. They they Grabbed Alpha-3 and did the same to him. I was next they all screaming in perfect unison that the Weak must be sacrificed and the Strong must be recruited. I (Hyperventilating) was placed on the table and as one of the instances was raising the flaming knife I heard gunshots and the sounds of the instances expiring. I was saved but... Alpha-1 and three were just corpses on the cave floor.

**Dr. Schneider:** Can you describe the Scp 7701-3 instances?

**Alpha-2:** They were just regular men and women but with Thaumatological symbols on their red robes. They spoke in a completely unknown language to me, but would occasionally scream unsettling things to me in English. 

**Dr. Schneider:** Thank you. I shall get some guards to escort you back to the Site Therapist before you return to your quarters. Your composure only one day after anomalous induced trauma will be noted with the higher ups.
 
[END LOG]

Immediately afterwards SCP 7701 was officially designated after additional MTF Quebec-17 units with armed personnel secured the area. Pictures of the Thaumatological symbols, genetic samples of the corpses, and ashes of fire were all taken and are currently undergoing studying.</textarea></pre>
