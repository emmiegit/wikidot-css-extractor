&gt; Low-ranking workers of the afterlife struggle under the employ of an uncaring Management.

Nobody knows why it exists, or since when. If there is a God watching over this place, no one has ever met him. All they know is the work – the labor, the orders, the management that every day places the souls of the dead where they need to be. Don’t asking for meaning or fulfillment. Your job is simple. Do it without questions. Toil without reward. What happens if you stop? Nobody knows, and they’re not very eager to find out.

[[tab The Entities]]

++++ THE WORKERS: 

The true main characters of this story, relegated to the sidelines by their nature.  Many are constructed beings, robots, automatons, golems, awakened plants.  Others are spirits, brought into being by the human unconscious, more behest to culture and ideas.  United by constant work, their duties are many, and despite how many there are, there&#39;s never enough workers to run the afterlife smoothly.  If the workers are seen by Souls, they often only appear as figures familiar with their beliefs.

++++ THE SOULS:

Once human, now something less.  It&#39;s too early to say whether all the Afterlife is good or bad, or parts are good and bad, but what can be said is the constant gridlock.  It could take decades, centuries to be fully processed.  Some of that is standing in lines, some is waiting for the next correspondence.  Souls likely encounter the workers in two ways, either because they&#39;re causing problems, be it escaping, finding loopholes, etc. or, least commonly, because they&#39;ve been integrated into the workforce.  This is incredibly uncommon, but can happen.

++++ THE SOVEREIGNS:

Ancient beyond words and powerful beyond measure, these are the lynchpins of the world. It is said that should they die, the Underworld as it&#39;s known would begin to collapse, but fortunately there doesn’t seem to be any risk of that happening any time soon. Like this world itself, they are never stable – there is no such thing as a fixed identity in this place. Like the wind that blows through the Forgotten Mines, their form and function changes with the whims of fate.  Some examples:

* ALTHKYR: The bodiless shadow wanders the land and never speaks. It may always be watching, but what it sees it never speaks. When it desires so, it is able to gain form and reshape the world. These times are always the sign of something terrible soon to come. Is it causing them, or granting us protection?

* ORTIZ: The speaker of nightmares. The shaper of wills. Do not listen to its uttered words, even if they seem wise. It does not leave its home beneath the Waterfall of the Damned, but many fools always come seeking its knowledge. It is a privilege, or curse, that they may grant it a single question before moving on to their final fate.

* FLAIN: The destroyer of souls too corrupt for judgement. If you encounter it, you will know for the first time in your life fear. How does it make its choices? What terrible deeds must you commit to stand before it? Perhaps the swing of its starry blade carries with it something more beautiful than we know, because it is not uncommon for its victims to smile as it cuts them. Few have survived. Those who did have become something too great to understand.

* DREZ: The friendliest of the overseers, the only one who seems to have a human face, but don’t be fooled. His eyes contain the souls of those he deems unworthy, those workers he feels detrimental, and they always see the truth. It is possible there are many of them, for he always seems to be where needed, but what he needs may not be what you want.

* OHJ: Keeper of the endless Maze of Records. Made of paper and dust and lost knowledge.

++++ MANAGEMENT: 

The Sovereigns claim that when the first of them were formed, Management was already there to give them direction.  Millenia has passed since that time, and if the Sovereigns are ever contacted by Management, they don&#39;t say.  For the workers, it&#39;s even worse.  A response, an approval, a sign-off, anything is extraordinarily rare.  Where they&#39;re located, who they are, even what they look like, is all an enigma.  It&#39;s extremely difficult to get around their rules.

[[tab The Afterlife]]

++++ THE PLACE:

It is vast, but not endless. From the Dead Fields where the souls wait in lines hundreds of miles long to process their paperwork, to the Factory Depths where strange machines are constantly formed, to the Golden Break Rooms where workers may get some 15 minutes of respite after years of toil, the Underworld contains many parts, and is constantly changing to mirror the world above. Or perhaps it’s the world above that changes to match the land of the dead? There is no one here to answer these secrets.

++++ THE REALMS:

Varied in appearance and purposed, these areas are where the Souls gather and the Sovereigns rule over.  Each is impossibly large, but somehow never enough for what&#39;s needed of them.  From a realm populated by dead stars chained to the ground to a seemingly normal suburb, every realm is filtered through the Sovereign that rules it, bending it and the Souls within to its will.  It is the workers jobs to keep up the façade of every realm, whether by having to restructure an area or eliminate a hostile threat.

++++ THE INBETWEEN AND AROUND:

Tall office buildings raise high, higher above swirling pools of fog.  The land is awash in monochrome, the keys for the color control room were lost long ago, and approval to create a replacement key is still in processing.  This is the area outside of the Realms, it sits in and around all the unused spaces.  For the workers, this is an approximation to home, and generally where they spend all their time.  There are some deviations to how the structures look, but generally, the infinite offices are what a regular worker will see in their lifetime.

+++ THE ROAD:

The strongest connection between The Afterlife and the rest of the universe. This is where souls end up when they are divorced from their mortal forms. It begins as just a straight dirt path piercing through a black void. The further along a soul travels, the more it changes. Some see staircases and elevators ascending into a bright light. Others wander through forest trails and dark caves. Eventually, the vast majority of souls find the end of their road and appear within a Sovereign&#39;s realm.

[[tab Entries]]
A new worker has entered the endless offices.  They are ignored, or simply unnoticed by the overworked constructs and souls rushing by.  Here is where the files on this old world will be stored, catalogued, and forgotten by the Management.  Hang in there!

[[tab Writing Guide]]
The themes of this canon should be fairly transparent, at least during the days where everything is only partially formed. Potential things you might be interested in writing about include:
* Time and unending sameness
* Optimism vs despair
* Meaning in a context of after-death
* Identity, alienation, freedom, and the need to elevate oneself above others
* Acceptance of the mundane
Generally speaking, if you have an idea: write it. Nothing&#39;s canon until it&#39;s on the site, and even then it&#39;s flexible. Nothing exists in this world unless you say it does. The past, present and future are all waiting to be decided. Here and now, you are as gods.

++++ Okay, but what actually //is// this?

This page is the second hub from our collaboratively-constructed canon event, the [[[sss2 | Serpentine Sorting System]]]. The full description of how this process works is available on that hub page, but the general gist is as follows:

# You submit writing prompts.
# We curate the prompts into a poll. You perform Democracy and whittle them down to a single survivor.
# This single prompt becomes the seed of a new canon. We nurture it. You discuss it on the [[[system:real-time-chat | Discord server]]].
# We curate your ideas into a hub, which with any luck you&#39;re currently reading. You write for this hub, and shape the new canon to your will. We update this page as more ideas are spawned and refined.
# The canon solidifies. Staff and users alike sit back and bask in the new writing. Everybody wins.

With a hearty collection of new stories, the initial posting period is over.  Keep in mind additions are always allowed and encouraged.  Or, feel free to enjoy the current entries.  Just remember to punch out, or your fired.

This prompt was provided by [[user MaliceAforethought]], and won out of 48 submissions. The Curators of the canon are currently [[*user rumetzen]] and [[*user Snapdragon133]]. Contact them if you have any questions or concerns.</textarea></pre>
