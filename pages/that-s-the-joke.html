//I know the thaumaturgists already told us that it wouldn&#39;t be susceptible to targeted metaexposure, but I still maintain that it was worth a shot. I didn&#39;t even need to use the whole page.//- Researcher James, age 8.
----
&gt; __00:00:__ Test commences. Subject instructed to initiate stated protocols.
&gt; 
&gt; __00:14:__ Subject reports gastrointestinal distress. KTE-8544-Porcelain produces characteristic vocalization.
&gt; 
&gt; __00:23:__ KTE-8544-Porcelain attempts to replicate via subject&#39;s posterior, but is hindered by testing protocols.
&gt; 
&gt; __03:19:__ Subject ceases testing protocols. KTE-8544-Porcelain observed to be subdued, but active. Subject instructed to remain on toilet in case protocols must be resumed.
&gt; 
&gt; __03:41:__ &lt;CLASSIFIED&gt; due to subject&#39;s unusually small frame and an oversight in toilet selection.
&gt; 
&gt; __04:19:__ &lt;CLASSIFIED&gt;

//I would have sworn that those cafeteria burritos would do the trick. Here&#39;s hoping they can get the guy a new butt.//- Researcher James.
----
Researcher James was instructed to interview KTE-8544-Porcelain to ascertain information that could assist in the entity&#39;s liquidation.
&gt; //Researcher James is seen pacing the restroom. Camera focused on KTE-8544-Porcelain shows the entity in its toilet. Scene is dramatic.//
&gt; 
&gt; __&lt;Begin Interview&gt;__
&gt; 
&gt; __Researcher James:__ So. KTE eight five four four porcelain. If that //is// your real name. Who are you?
&gt; 
&gt; __KTE-8544-Porcelain:__ i am the butt ghost!!
&gt; 
&gt; __RJ:__ And why should I believe you? //&lt;Slams his hands on the toilet seat and presumably glares at the butt ghost in a threatening manner.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; __BG:__ im going to eat your butt
&gt; 
&gt; __RJ:__ How bizarre. //&lt;Stands up from the toilet seat and accesses a plastic baggie of Goldfish crackers.&gt;// Why do you eat our butts, butt ghost? Butts do not equal love, you know.
&gt; 
&gt; __BG:__ ffft fart poot poop phbbbt
&gt; 
&gt; __RJ:__ //&lt;Chews on Goldfish crackers like a hard-boiled detective would chew on a cigar.&gt;// Fascinating, truly fascinating. You know, despite your rather... prolific history of gluteocidal self-replication, you seem to be a solitary creature. Mind telling me why?
&gt; 
&gt; __BG:__ //&lt;makes more hilarius farting noises&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; __RJ:__ But of course. It would only make sense, with you being a butt ghost. One last thing: //&lt;Looks the butt ghost dead in the eye with a chilling stare.&gt;// Wiping. Why does it get rid of you? //Where are the hostages?//
&gt; 
&gt; __BG:__ //&lt;tries to eat jameses butt, butt he cant becus hes in the toilet and james isnt&gt;// im a butt ghost
&gt; 
&gt; __RJ:__ //&lt;Attempts to snap his fingers, but he hasn&#39;t quite gotten that down yet.&gt;// It all makes sense now! What else could the moral of the story be? I&#39;ve got all I need to go to the presses with this!
&gt; 
&gt; __&lt;End Interview&gt;__
&gt; 
&gt; __Closing statement:__ Researcher James was grounded --for unrelated reasons-- after the conclusion of this interview.

//He knows he&#39;s only allowed one snack in the afternoon. And by the way, we don&#39;t have to make him a Researcher just because only he can talk to it.//- Researcher James&#39;s Dad

&gt; __Test ID:__ 8544-Porcelain-Gimmel-83
&gt; 
&gt; __Description:__ At the recommendation of Sanderson Consulting Partners, a task force was formed to use victims of [[[scp-butt-j | KTE-2985-Silver]]] to destroy the butt ghost. Four infectees were brought to the toilet containing the entity. The entity was destroyed by repeated exposure to emissions of the infectees.
&gt; 
&gt; //Question: Is there any reason we couldn&#39;t have just used normal lasers?//- Researcher James&#39;s Dad
&gt; 
&gt; //Yes. The reason is because butts.//- Researcher James
