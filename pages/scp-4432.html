**Item #:** SCP-4432

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4432 is currently contained in a padded and soundproofed room within Site-55&#39;s Euclid containment wing.

**Description:** SCP-4432 is a heavily modified humanoid entity possessing multiple anomalous properties, measuring 165cm tall and weighing 54kg.

SCP-4432&#39;s modifications include:
* a detachable metal fish head,
* a candy dispenser replacing the trachea,
* a small CRT television protruding from its chest,
* an ethernet cable in place of genitals which connects to a network named &#34;intrenet&#34;,
* five USB C charging cables protruding from the navel,
* a Triple A battery pack located on the upper back; empty,
* small tools such as a knife, spork, scissors, etc replacing the fingers,
* a lightbulb replacing the nose, which glows red when a lie is told within 3 meters of it,
* a liquid soap dispenser extending from the top of the spine,
* roller skates in place of feet,
* and a lunar calendar pinned to its mid-back.

SCP-4432 constantly produces vocalizations and appears to be aware of its surroundings, but is unable to reliably communicate with Foundation personnel. A temporary tattoo reading &#34;mr mister® by [[[dado-hub|dado]]] &#34; was found on the subject&#39;s lower back upon initial discovery, but has since faded.

The subject has been identified as Ricardo Trujillo, a construction worker from Albuquerque, New Mexico who was reported as missing on December 26th, 2019 after responding to a Craigslist ad for a &#34;human pig of guinea (pay good cash)[sic]&#34;.

**Addendum 4432.1:** Recovered Document

The following document was found glued to the TV on SCP-4432&#39;s chest.

&gt; wow you has find mr mister by dado, limited time only item from dado
&gt;
&gt; dado is see how swiss are make knife and spoon and scissor into army knife of swiss and dado is think &#39;hmmm perhaps consolidate is best for dado as well&#39; so dado is look at the small misters of [[[dr-wondertainment-hub|dr wanderingtrain]]] and say &#39;why have multiple when dado can instead be into making army swiss mister&#39;
&gt;
&gt; congratulations [[[tales-of-mr-collector|you are become collector person]]], dado is not judge of gender preference unlike doctor wundertaint who is much lawyery and mean

**Addendum 4432.2:** Recovered Text Messages

The following communications were recovered from Mr. Trujillo&#39;s phone, presumably occuring prior to becoming SCP-4432.
