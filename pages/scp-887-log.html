This is a log of the decoded and assembled output of [[[SCP-887]]]. Researchers are encouraged to volunteer at decoding the massive backlog of content.

----

**Researcher:** Dr. Zara

**Sample 887-2930:** Twelve pages written in Latin, mixed with French. The text describes a political system in which the movements of the tides are used to determine the next government. The text later veers into an unusual level of detail regarding the outfits one should wear in such tide-selecting ceremonies.

**Sample 887-3114:** Eight pages of a crudely-drawn comic describing &#34;Captain Backwards&#34;, his ability to enact an action //after// its effect and how he uses it to fight crime. The comic ends by Captain Backwards destroying himself to retroactively create the universe.

**Sample 887-4011:** 133 pages, written in corrupted Esperanto. A thorough description of the contents of an unwed maiden&#39;s bedroom as it existed in a seventeenth-century European city (specific location is undetermined at this time).

**Sample 887-4281:** A single page with five lines drawn diagonally across it with seventeen dots interspersed, in the manner of a musical notation staff. The resulting score, when played with pure tones through a synthesizer, induces seizures and short-term anterograde amnesia in 85% of the observed subjects.

**Sample 887-5102:** Fifteen pages covered in curved lines. A brilliant deductive effort by Dr. ██████ determined these to be contiguous sections of a single level map, depicting a 30 km² area of the surface of Saturn&#39;s moon Enceladus. Seven points in the map are circled.

**Sample 887-5227:** Four pages, English. A formal proposal to the United States government to introduce an eighth day to the week. This day would be employed in spiritual contemplation and the worship of pagan divinities the document calls &#34;under-represented&#34;.

**Sample 887-5836:** Three pages covered with hexadecimal numbers, then torn into narrow strips. The assembled document was deciphered as machine code for a hardware driver called &#34;LGCL_XPNDR&#34;.

**Sample 887-6334:** Three pages. A word-by-word replication of the primary report on [[[SCP-657]]], with the exception he is called &#34;Bernard&#34;. 

**Sample 887-3877:** Eight pages, German. A folkloric tale of a boy born without a heart, who ventures into the woods and acquires one from a friendly old woman. He grows up and marries a beautiful lady, who dies giving birth to a demon that devours both.

**Sample 887-4710:** 96 pages, Akkadian. An extended research article on the properties of naturally occurring &#34;earth lines&#34;, and how one might use them for transportation of cargo and projectiles. Several devices intended to employ these properties, built out of wood and lodestone, are outlined.

**Sample 887-5005:** Five pages, English. 272 different misspellings of the word &#34;anthropomorphization&#34;.

**Sample 887-9912:** Six pages, Latin. A star chart clearly modeled after medieval European charts, but without any recognizable celestial body dispositions. Fourteen constellations are labeled: Pegasus, Sextans (sextant), Centaurus, Chimaera, Cygnus (swan), Lancea (lance), Trilobus (trilobite), Aranea (spider), Nonavulpecula (nine-tailed fox), Caudavorae (&#34;tail-eater&#34;, apparently a self-devouring serpent), ████████, ██████, ████ ████████ and Leolacertus (lion lizard)

**Sample 887-6776:** 2353 pages, English. The phrase &#34;Does the black moon howl?&#34; repeated over 27 thousand times.

**Sample 887-8312:** 14 pages plus 22 sections of other pages. 637 names, 382 of which have been matched to professional photographers of over 30 nationalities. Research suggests most, if not all, have captured pictures of petroglyphs and scenery around Kata Tjuta and Uluru/Ayers Rock in Australia.

**Sample 887-0566:** 490 pages, Spanish. A story called &#34;La última aventura de Don Quijote&#34; and attributed to Miguel de Cervantes. While the first few pages are a reasonable simile of Cervantes&#39; style, the narration becomes confused and then outright nonsense afterwards - notably, Dulcinea&#39;s dialogue is unintelligible, and Sancho spends several chapters repeatedly crawling out of a muddy pool.

**Researcher:** Researcher Voct

**Sample 887-3162:** 38 sonnets in what was identified as medieval Flemish (Antwerp dialect); each sonnet describes in allegorical terms the lives and political accomplishments of a deceased President of the United States; the last line of each sonnet is the President&#39;s last words, and the first several words of each sonnet form an acrostic representing a Latinized version of the President&#39;s name.

Analysis indicates that the episodes are predicated on the //Simpsons// characters having aged in real time beginning in 1997.

**Sample 887-0908:** One thousand six hundred and eleven pages of messages posted to an Internet mailing list dedicated to writing &#34;slashfic&#34; (amateur romantic/homoerotic fiction) about the past and present members of the United States Supreme Court; content includes critiques, unfinished drafts, and analyses of judicial decisions in terms of erotic value.

**Sample 887-0944:** Sketches of human dental records, labeled as belonging to the members of Jimmy Carter&#39;s presidential cabinet (identified by birth name and cabinet portfolio), dated to the last month of Carter&#39;s administration. Names and portfolios are misspelled, but sketches have been assessed by Foundation forensic dentists as plausible extrapolations of known medical data for the individuals in question.

**Sample 887-3137:** 47 pages of Hexadecimal code. Code successfully compiles into a PNG image of Dr. ████████ in a speedo. Dr. ████████ claims no such picture was taken.

**Sample 887-0031:** Map of a country called &#34;Lemuria&#34;, written in English, Circa 18██. &#34;Lemuria&#34; refers to a hypothetical land bridge that was thought to connect Madagascar with the rest of Africa, only to be disproved with the theory of continental drift. The map does not correspond with any known geography, above or below water. Interestingly, the capital of the nation is called &#34;Atlantis&#34;.

**Sample 887-3391:** One page, apparently from a script for a [[[scp-993|Bobble the Clown TV show]]]. Bobble is demonstrating how to &#39;catch some more&#39; cyclists by stringing wires across cycle trails. Handwriting is extremely florid and includes a border of loops and smiley faces around the page. Show not intercepted by the Foundation, though tone is a good match for known episodes.

**Sample 887-3395:** Twenty-three (23) pages of extremely detailed diagrams of how a bramble bush has grown over the shallow grave of four people. Bodies are marked as having been fully skeletonised; diagrams indicate the positions of every large bone as well as the shape of the bush. One skeleton is a juvenile female, the others juvenile males. Plant biologists estimate that the bush has been growing for three (3) years, and the steep sides of the grave suggest that it was dug in heavy clay soil.

**Sample 887-10356:** A proportionally exact (albeit at 1:100 size scale) diagram of a machine gun. The weapon appears to be intended to discharge a form of laser but uses and often makes notes of unknown materials or natural laws.

The text also will mildly compel readers to finish the book, and approx 98% of readers profess an increase in religiousness.

Notes: The projectile only is effective against humans; animals appear to have no effect. Samples submitted for limited distribution among MTF personnel.
