**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7392 is to be contained within a reinforced humanoid containment chamber measuring 5 meters by 5 meters. The chamber must be constructed using reinforced concrete walls with an embedded Faraday cage to prevent electronic interference. The floor, ceiling, and walls should be fitted with motion sensors and pressure-sensitive plates to detect any movement or stretching attempts by SCP-7392. The chamber should be under 24/7 surveillance using infrared cameras.

SCP-7392&#39;s chamber must be staffed by a minimum of two armed guards at all times. The guards should be equipped with non-lethal weapons, including tasers and sedative darts. Personnel assigned to SCP-7392 should undergo regular training in close-quarters combat and be prepared to neutralize SCP-7392 in the event of an escape attempt.

**Description:** SCP-7392 is a highly dangerous humanoid creature with the ability to teleport, stretch, and contort its body in unnatural ways. The entity stands approximately 2.2 meters tall, with a lanky build and elongated limbs. Its body composition appears to be composed of a flexible yet resilient substance resembling organic matter.

SCP-7392 has demonstrated the ability to teleport short distances, with a maximum observed range of approximately 10 meters. The teleportation process is instantaneous and does not appear to be hindered by solid objects or barriers. SCP-7392&#39;s teleportation ability allows it to evade capture and makes it an extremely elusive and difficult entity to contain.

Furthermore, SCP-7392 can manipulate its body in various ways, including stretching and contorting its limbs, torso, and neck. It has been observed extending its limbs to considerable lengths, up to 2.5 times its normal proportions. The entity can also compress its body to fit into narrow spaces or flatten itself to become almost two-dimensional. These abilities grant SCP-7392 a high degree of agility and allow it to access areas that would otherwise be inaccessible.

SCP-7392 has exhibited predatory behavior and has displayed a high level of intelligence. It actively seeks out human prey, often lurking in shadows or confined spaces, waiting for an opportunity to ambush. The entity&#39;s teleportation and stretching abilities make it a formidable adversary in close-quarters combat, allowing it to strike from unexpected angles and retreat before countermeasures can be taken.

**Addendum 7392-A: Incident Log**

**Incident 7392-01:** On [DATE REDACTED], SCP-7392 breached containment and managed to overpower the guards stationed at its chamber. The entity utilized its stretching and teleportation abilities to evade capture and caused severe injuries to several personnel in its escape attempt. A containment breach alert was issued, and Mobile Task Force Epsilon-7 (&#34;Shadowhunters&#34;) was dispatched to recapture SCP-7392.

Following a prolonged pursuit, SCP-7392 was eventually cornered in a confined space and neutralized using a combination of sedative darts and high-voltage electrical shocks. The entity was successfully contained and transported back to its chamber, and the breach was classified as contained.

**Addendum 7392-B: Experimentation Log**

Due to SCP-7392&#39;s unique abilities, a series of controlled experiments were conducted to better understand its teleportation and stretching capabilities. These experiments aimed to determine the limitations, range, and potential vulnerabilities of the entity.

Experiment 7392-01:
Procedure: SCP-7392 was instructed to teleport from one side of its containment chamber to the other, a distance of approximately 5 meters.
Result: SCP-7392 successfully teleported as instructed, indicating that its teleportation ability is not limited by distance within its observed range.

Experiment 7392-08:
Procedure: SCP-7392 was restrained with reinforced metal chains and subjected to mechanical stress tests to determine the limits of its stretching and contortion abilities.
Result: SCP-7392 displayed remarkable resilience and flexibility, allowing it to withstand extreme stretching and contortion without apparent physical damage. Its body returned to its original form once the stress was removed.

**Note:** Further experimentation is currently under review, taking into consideration the risks associated with SCP-7392 containment and its potential for causing harm.

**Conclusion:** SCP-7392 poses a significant threat due to its teleportation and body manipulation abilities. Strict containment measures are necessary to prevent further breaches and ensure the safety of personnel. Research into countermeasures and potential weaknesses of SCP-7392 is ongoing.</textarea></pre>
