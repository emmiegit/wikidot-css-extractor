I grew up in Ombre Rouge, Louisiana. While I wasn&#39;t a popular kid at school, I had two close friends: Charlie and Edith. We stayed together until we finished high school. Charlie, moved out after that, leaving just two of us.

We discovered a new passion for the otherworldly and supernatural.

Edith and I became some sort of a mystery tag-team, like in those old cartoons.

We speculated online since Ombre Rouge is too... calm. Despite the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3631 disappearances of 2005] and some traffic accidents, nothing interesting happened in this small swamp town. At least that&#39;s what I thought.

When Edith heard of more disappearances in 2018 we went to investigate. We heard something about a barn but when we got there, we found nothing. Strange. The police hadn&#39;t arrived yet. Just in case, I took pictures of the barn. But, somehow, they got deleted from my phone a few days after.

Edith and I were both sure someone was conspiring against us. But who?

The police? No, that wouldn&#39;t make sense.

Maybe it&#39;s the culprit? Feasible, I guess.

Or maybe some secret organization trying to stop us?

We used one of those corkboards -- yes, we really were into it -- to summarize all of our evidence. Which, well, wasn&#39;t that much. But we were sure we were onto something. We spent a whole afternoon preparing it in my room. When Edith eventually left, a bag was put over my head and I was knocked out.

I woke up in a dimly illuminated room, handcuffed to a table. In front of me, there was a woman in a suit. She told me about the SCP Foundation and its mission to keep humanity safe from anomalies.

My body shaked as I thought they would have tortured me to keep my mouth shut about what we saw. Against all odds, I was wrong. They were interested in me.

They offered me a job.

Me? Working for a shadow organization that deals with the paranormal? I accepted.

There was a catch though. They told me I couldn&#39;t contact Edith after I joined them. They would wipe her memory. I objected, I insisted that Edith could work with them too. They refused. According to them, Edith was a liability. &#34;She does not meet our qualifications.&#34;

What does that even mean? We have the same education. And I don&#39;t think being a part-time bartender is more prestigious than being a secretary. I just couldn&#39;t figure out why would they choose me.

I was conflicted. Should I give up Edith for a dream job? I asked them if I could take some time to think about it.

They gave me a day.

Before I could realize it, I was back in my room. The corkboard was gone too. Immediately, I picked up my to call Edith and tell her about what happened but then I realized -- What was the point? They would make her forget no matter what.

Perhaps going outside for some fresh air was be best. When I opened the door I saw that it was already nighttime. I checked my phone again. 

June 30th. 23:34.

The Foundation had brought me to one of their facilities and back in less than a couple of hours. I was knocked out for most of it so I didn&#39;t feel like sleeping.

When I stepped out of my house, I felt something was wrong. And no, it wasn&#39;t the humid summer heat.

I looked up and saw something spherical. And UFO perhaps? Or maybe the Foundation? I couldn&#39;t tell.

Something dropped from it, all across Ombre Rouge.

Was this the Foundation&#39;s response to what I said? I guess I didn&#39;t matter since... since...

Since that was [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5197 the last thing I saw.]
