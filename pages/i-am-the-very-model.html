I am the very model of an explorer and gentleman
I&#39;ve hunted cryptids airborne, terrestrial, and aquarian
I know the laws of science are quite rigid and inflexible
Except, of course, for thaumaturgy, which makes me quite vexable

I&#39;m very well acquainted, too, with matters scientifical
Of physics and of chemistry, both simple and atomical
I&#39;ve mastered all the studies of phlogiston and aetherius
I claim this in no jest, for you will find I am quite serious

I&#39;m very good at rhetoric and disputations logical
I&#39;m learned in our politics and matters sociological
In short, with cryptids airborne, terrestrial, and aquarian
I am the very model of an explorer and gentleman

I know of secret histories both eldritch and mythical
I&#39;ve trod the paths of ancient cities Martian and Atlantical
I&#39;ve faced the ghosts of fallen lords Arthurian and Indian
And fallen off Mt. Everest to turn back and begin again

I can tell authentic poltergeists from frauds and forgeries
I know the differences between bewitchments and sorceries
I hum while sleeping melodies and symphonies quite magical
And dream of terrors bordering upon ecclesiastical

I can write a peace treaty in lost tongues of an elder race
And tell you every detail of the planets found in outer space
In short, with cryptids airborne, terrestrial, and aquarian
I am the very model of an explorer and gentleman

I can tell at sight a wyvern from a wyrm or para-drake
And discern thirty-six types of real vampires from spoofs and fakes
I&#39;ve studied bones and fossils angelic and dinosaurical
And resurrected horrors divine, mundane, and demonical

I&#39;ve learned of progress made mechanical and scientifically
Although only up &#39;til the turn of the twentieth century
But no one can deny the grace of our queen most Victorial
Whose reign around the world is both glorious and eternial

There&#39;s some who say my form has been reduced to that of sluggery
(Were I not a Christian, I&#39;d accuse them all of buggery)
But still, with cryptids airborne, terrestrial, and aquarian
I am the very model of an explorer and gentleman!

//Memo from Dr. Samesh: The above lyrics were found handwritten in a document filed among the personal effects of [[[SCP-1867]]] in his country estate, dated 4/18/1880. The document was filed along with a letter to SCP-1867 signed by composer W.S. Gilbert, dated 10/17/1882, thanking him for his &#34;lyrical tribute&#34; and inviting him to attend the upcoming premiere of the comic opera// Iolanthe.

//The text of the final verse, which appears to refer to SCP-1867&#39;s current physical status, has been written in different handwriting than the remainder of the text, in the margin at the bottom of the page, underneath a verse which has been scribbled over to the point of illegibility. Graphological analysis has confirmed that the handwriting of this later addition matches that of [[[SCP-662]]]-1 (&#34;Mr. Deeds&#34;). In Interview 662-207, Mr. Deeds refused to confirm or deny whether he had altered the original document, citing his previous employers&#39; privacy.//</textarea></pre>
