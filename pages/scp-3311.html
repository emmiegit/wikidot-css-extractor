[[include component:image-block name=chairs.png |caption=SCP-3311-1 instances in their respective compartments.]]
**Item #:** SCP-3311

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3311 is to be kept closed and locked at all times. No personnel are to enter SCP-3311 for any reason other than for testing purposes. The facility containing SCP-3311 should be monitored for any suspicious activity and patrolled by a Foundation agent posed as a security guard.

**Description:** SCP-3311 refers to a storage unit located in █████████, Florida. The outside of SCP-3311 is nondescript and identical to adjacent units which are affixed in rows, making relocation impossible.

SCP-3311 contains a spatial anomaly, extending far past what its physical constraints allow and appearing without limit. At this time, exploration has reached approximately 585 kilometers into the unit, during which no apparent end was observed. SCP-3311&#39;s interior turns on a slight bend, making long range viewing difficult. Visual broadcasting deteriorates rapidly within the anomaly, prompting the usage of relays to help extend the range of reception. GPS positioning fails to trace individuals who pass beyond five meters of the entrance, approximately halfway into the unit were it possessing correct internal dimensions. Tracking signal is not lost; it remains at the halfway point until the device passes out of range of reception or is disconnected via other means.

SCP-3311 is hypothesized to have a minor cognitohazardous effect on sentient life, the full scope of which is still under analysis.

The walls of SCP-3311&#39;s interior are lined with cubic compartments of varying size,[[footnote]] Average compartment size is 1.25m^^3^^ [[/footnote]] each bearing a glass panel with a magnetic lock on the top side. All compartments contain or have contained an instance of SCP-3311-1.

SCP-3311-1 is the designation for the anomalous collection of chairs found within the unit. Each chair is seemingly unique, with none of the approximately three million chairs observed repeating. SCP-3311-1 instances have been shown to match other chairs found outside of the anomaly, suggesting that SCP-3311 may contain a copy of every chair in physical existence. SCP-3311-1 instances will always be a chair in some form, although the concept of chair within SCP-3311 is found to be slightly looser and more adaptable than other places in reality.[[footnote]] See //Exploration Logs 3311-B, C//. [[/footnote]] Some notable instances of SCP-3311-1:

* An Egyptian throne dated at approximately ████ years old
* A custom, monogrammed office chair matching that of Site-88 Director A. Lewis
* A replica of [[[SCP-1609]]][[footnote]] Instance was found to be non-anomalous. [[/footnote]]
* An IKEA-brand bean bag chair
* Perfectly uprooted wooden stumps/large rocks
* A mahogany chair made of other, smaller mahogany chairs

SCP-3311 was brought to the Foundation&#39;s attention on ██/██/████ after it was repossessed due to nonpayment. A small media coverup was deployed and the owners and employees of the facility were amnesticised before editing their records to place the unit under Foundation ownership. The previous owner was traced to a retirement home in nearby ███ ██████ before being taken in for questioning.[[footnote]] See //Interview Log 3311-A// for more information. [[/footnote]]

**Addendum 3311.1 Exploration Logs:**

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ ACCESS EXPL-3311-A.log&#34; hide=&#34;- hide&#34;]]
&gt; **__Exploration Log 3311-A__**
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** D-9082
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** This was the first conducted exploration of SCP-3311. At this point in time, audiovisual surveillance degraded within ~3km of the entrance to the anomaly. One D-Class personnel was equipped with a shoulder-mounted camera and a pack containing three days&#39; worth of provisions, a set of twenty-four 600-hour micro relays with a range of 10km, and a small medkit. Subject was then directed to observe the inside of SCP-3311.
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; //Camera comes live, D-9082 ducking under the door. The door retracts and is secured by personnel from the outside. SCP-3311&#39;s interior is moderately lit by unknown means.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** Did they just lock me in here?
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** It&#39;s a safety precaution. They will be standing just outside, don&#39;t worry.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** If you say so. This place is- whoa, okay. Chairs.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Observant. Please proceed.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-9082 walks down the pathway, taking extra time to look around. The interior is quiet, the only noise being D-9082&#39;s footsteps on the concrete floor.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** They&#39;re all different, huh? Odd collector, maybe?
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject continues in this manner for some time without much event.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Do you notice anything out of the ordinary with any of the chairs themselves?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** Uh, let&#39;s see, let me try-
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject is seen attempting to open one of the compartments, it appears locked. She tries another and it does not yield.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9028:** Should I break the glass?
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** No. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** Oh, there&#39;s something here on the leg of this chair. Looks like an inscription.
&gt; 
&gt; //The words &#34;FLOOR MODEL&#34; can be seen etched into the leg.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** &#39;Floor model&#39;. Stolen from a showroom floor? Oh, wait- look.
&gt; 
&gt; //The next chair has the same inscription, and the next.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** Huh. I don&#39;t get it. Should I keep going?
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Yes, continue. You are nearing on the three kilometer mark, please place and activate one of your relays.
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject does not respond but retrieves one of the devices from her pack and presses a small button on its side.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** Like that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Just like that. You&#39;re linked up. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** Great.
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject proceeds in silence for the next twenty minutes, briefly pausing to look at various chairs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** I mean, is this it? Just one big loop of chairs? I guess that beats some of the other stuff you guys get into. [pause] Hey, I recognize that one.
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject is seen approaching an average-looking kitchen chair, featuring a faded, gray cushion.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** My grandmother had those. It even has the coffee stains. And- yup, &#39;Floor model&#39;, right on the side. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** I don&#39;t know if I like this place, I don&#39;t like //them//.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** //They// are just chairs. Please, continue.  
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject takes a few breaths and continues forward. The next thirty kilometers pass without incident or change in layout, D-9082 activating new relays every ten. Subject rests for a bit and eats before continuing onward.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** God, I just can&#39;t stop thinking about chairs now. There has to be billions of chairs on this planet. They might outnumber humans. Good lord. We&#39;d never win.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Do I need to remind you that chairs are inanimate?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** No- no [chuckles] I mean, even if they were-
&gt; 
&gt; //A loud scraping noise nearby cuts off D-9082. She spins around but the tunnel is empty.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** What was that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** We heard it too, stay on your guard.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** Yeah.
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject continues for another forty kilometers over the next day without incident, although D-9082 is clearly nervous. A low hum is picked up, not dissimilar to magnetostriction, and persists at a low volume for the most of the transcript.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** I just realized, there are no vents in here. The air isn&#39;t stale like I would think. It isn&#39;t fresh, either, more like, clean, maybe? Sterile. Yeah, that&#39;s a better word for it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Noted. Please let us know if you begin to feel lightheaded or unwell.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-9082 continues for a short while longer before setting up camp. Subject removes her camera and places it by her side, leaving it running. Nothing eventful happens for the next several hours, aside from one brief period an hour in where the same scraping noise can be heard in the distance. Subject&#39;s sleep is fitful, she wakes suddenly and consumes some rations before setting off.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** Slept poorly. Dreamt of chairs. I sat on one and it tried to eat me. Spent the rest of the dream doing my best not to sit down, but I wasn&#39;t looking up, and I missed the giant chair above me until it came down on my face.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** It&#39;s understandable you would be experiencing this as a reaction to being in such a foreign environment. We&#39;ll have you back out here good as new in no time.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** Thanks. I just want to get this over with. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject continues walking for 22 hours, reaching the two hundred kilometer mark. Passing a large [[[scp-184|chair made of solid jade]]], D-9082 moves closer to inspect it but quickly changes course, avoiding it.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** This thing is making my head hurt, god, there&#39;s just way too much chair in one place here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Can you elaborate on that?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** It&#39;s like- you know how when you have a bunch of friends, and you&#39;ve all been friends for so long, you start to borrow things about them, things that you admire? Traits. Like you might start using my catchphrase or something, and I might borrow that thing you do //so well//.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** I don&#39;t see how this has to do with-
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** You rub off on people, you interact with them and leave a lasting impression that grows over time. And the more of them there are that behave in a certain way, the more likely they are to borrow those traits. A positive feedback loop of reaffirmations.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Please try to be more specific about how exactly this relates to these chairs?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** It&#39;s more than just the object. It&#39;s the idea of the object and the object, and we are the idea- the concept- more than the object. Without the idea, we&#39;re all just lumps of molecules, indistinguishable. The object is just a canvas for the idea, even if that idea is chairs and you&#39;re a human. Does that make any sense?
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** I suppose. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** No, you&#39;re right, I probably sound crazy. [pauses] You can see me though, right? Do I seem more like a chair to you than before? [chuckles]
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Do you //feel// more like a chair than before?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to tell, you kn-
&gt; 
&gt; //Feed is lost abruptly as the relay at the 53km mark stops functioning. Contact with D-9082 is not reestablished for another two days, after which D-9082 appears within range of the 43km point and heading back.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** D-9082, we lost contact with you, please report your status.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-9082:** Oh, god, finally. The feed went dead, but I laid the last two out. It should be good to go, just, please get me out of here. I think I might be completely over chairs- and I&#39;m definitely not one of them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Alright. We can do that, you&#39;re almost back. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Egress from SCP-3311 was uneventful and has been redacted from this document for brevity. Subject is healthy physically but suffers from mild PTSD and exhibits a strong aversion to chairs. Displays symptoms of both kathisophobia[[footnote]] Fear of sitting down. [[/footnote]] and cleithrophobia,[[footnote]] Fear of being trapped underneath something or being stuck and unable to move.[[/footnote]] requiring sedation before sleep and most physical examinations.//

&gt; **__Exploration Log 3311-B__**
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject:** D-7820
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** This is the second attempted exploration of SCP-3311. Relays were set up to the 254km point from the last test, but the malfunction at the 53km relay required replacement before that point could be reached. One D-Class personnel was equipped with an identical pack as previous, including two extra days&#39; worth of rations and a bottle of 10 × 100mg caffeine anhydrous tablets. Subject was then instructed to enter SCP-3311.
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; //Camera comes online, D-7820 is seen heading down the passage. Subject has already consumed four of the ten included caffeine tablets and one bottle of water.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** [laughs] They said I was going to look at chairs today? Like, some bigger-on-the-inside art gallery bullshit, right? And I get here and, look at that! Just a bunch of chairs. Is that all there is to this place? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Yes, something like that. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** Cool, cool. Look doc, I&#39;m not an artsy guy, I don&#39;t even really know what I&#39;m supposed to be looking for here. [pauses] &#39;Floor model&#39;. Like, what, a prototype? I guess that makes sense, right? Still, this is some collection. I don&#39;t think I have the same eye for art this dude has in regards to designer chairs.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** [clears throat] Please continue until anything notable occurs.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-7820 walks steadily for the next several hours, making several attempts at conversation and taking a break some time after.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** You know what I would really like right now? I&#39;d like to sit down on a chair. Not this awful concrete. Isn&#39;t that some special little hell, being surrounded by chairs but not being able to take a seat? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** [indecipherable, off-mic] Uh, sure. Yeah. We say you try and get one of the chairs out of their compartments. Feel free to attempt to break the glass.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** Alright, then. 
&gt; 
&gt; //D-7820 attempts to open the compartment door to a cushioned chair, which does not yield. Subject kicks the glass, causing it to shatter. D-7820 retrieves the chair, but drops it in surprise when a loud alarm is heard blaring from an unknown location, falling silent a moment later.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** You guys totally screwed me on this one, didn&#39;t you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be fine. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Taking several moments to make sure nothing was coming, D-7820 sits on the chair, which appears to exhibit no detrimental effects.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** Just give me a few minutes. This is nice.
&gt; 
&gt; //A few minutes later, subject consumes more caffeine and continues.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** I wish I could take it with me, to be honest.
&gt; 
&gt; //D-7820 travels unabated for the next eleven hours before setting up camp and resting at the 53km mark. Subject replaces the relay, which has been damaged via blunt force, reestablishing contact with the rest of the chain. Afterwards, he removes the camera and sleeps for the next three hours, waking early evening and heading out promptly.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Progression to the 100km mark takes place all throughout the night and the subsequent day. Subject pauses at a compartment containing a toilet, then shakes his head before continuing on.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** Now you tell me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Maybe next time you&#39;ll understand why we said it was unwise for you to ingest five days&#39; worth of pharmacy-grade caffeine within twelve hours of receiving it, on an empty stomach.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** I regret nothing. Also, unrelated question, did you guys pack me any antacids? 
&gt; 
&gt; [EXTRANEOUS DIALOGUE OMITTED]
&gt; 
&gt; //Around the 125km point, the same buzzing feedback is picked up through the camera&#39;s microphone. Subject does not seem to be aware of this.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** I can&#39;t believe how many chairs there are in here. I&#39;m getting pretty sick of them, to be honest. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Microphone picks up the sound of several large bangs in the distance.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** [quietly] Is someone else in here? I&#39;ve been out here for two days, can I come back now? I&#39;m beginning to worry I might have pissed something off. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Negative. You have been lagging behind the previous subject, who was nearing the two hundred kilometer mark by this point. She is currently fine; please keep walking. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject mutters to himself and proceeds onward with moderate reluctance. Nothing of interest happens for the next forty minutes, after which D-7820 stops abruptly.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** I hear something.
&gt; 
&gt; //Audio feed picks up the sound of a rhythmic creaking noise. Subject approaches the source cautiously, rounding the bend to reveal a single rocking chair situated in the pathway. Chair is not moving, the noise having ceased abruptly.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** Oh, sure, that&#39;s not foreboding. Has that happened before?
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** [indicipherable, off-mic] -No. No, that&#39;s new. Proceed with caution.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** Don&#39;t have to tell me twice.
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject takes a wide berth around the chair, which does not move again. D-7820 is seen moving quickly, reaching the 200km point and passing the previous record by the next day. Subject sets up camp, unpacking the backpack, setting several rations and the set of relays on top while presumably taking stock of the remaining provisions and looking for more caffeine. Turning away for an unknown reason, the buzzing noise is heard increasing in intensity.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** I wonder if chairs play musical chairs with other chairs. Or maybe they&#39;d sit on people? [laughs nervously] I- wait.
&gt; 
&gt; //Camera swings back around to reveal the backpack missing, the contents now laying on a bare floor.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** What the-? Is someone screwing with me? Hello?
&gt; 
&gt; //Silence, aside from the persistent buzzing noise.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** Who would steal an empty bag? I hate this place.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Noted. You have a few days left, then you&#39;re home free.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** Easy for you to say.
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject attempts to sleep for a few hours, which appears futile, then rouses himself. D-7820 consumes the included Naproxen tablets, binds the remaining supplies in his Foundation-issued pullover, and heads out a short while later. At the 270km point, the path turns into a section containing the same chair in two hundred different colors. Subject rests briefly.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** Fucking art, man. //Fucking chairs//.
&gt; 
&gt; //Progressing further, control notes that the quality and exactness of SCP-3311-1 instances as &#34;chairs&#34; begins to fluctuate. Compartments are seen containing rocks, piles of various detritus, and small desks. D-7820 continues but stops abruptly.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** You&#39;ve got to be kidding me.
&gt; 
&gt; //Camera turns to look at a nearby compartment which contains an identical replica of the supply pack that D-7820 lost the previous day, sans rations. A small tag hanging off the bottom reads &#39;FLOOR MODEL&#39;.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** I- I think I get it now.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Yes?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** What if my backpack also became a chair?
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** Can you please elaborate?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** Think about it. I put my stuff on top of my backpack and it becomes a chair for that stuff. Right? So then it becomes a chair and the chair shows up in the gallery because it&#39;s a chair and that&#39;s what chairs do. That&#39;s what they say, anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** &#39;They&#39;?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** The chairs. I mean, I know they can&#39;t talk, but I can feel their presence now, and it is //palpable//. Tangible. The air is thick with it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Control:** With chair?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** ...Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject walks in silence for the next six hours, pausing occasionally to look behind him. Setting up camp at the 300km point, D-7820 is seen attempting to rest again, using their pullover sweatshirt as a makeshift blanket.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Some time during the next few hours, D-7820 is awakened by the sound of large thuds and scrapes, growing in volume. Subject forgets to reattach camera to shoulder mount, which is facing slightly askew, and sits up rapidly. Most of the feed&#39;s view is obscured with a portion of his torso. The source of the noise is not identified, but is observed ramming D-7820 in the back, throwing him from his position. Subject is seen hitting the concrete face-first with significant force, the backs of his legs now visible in the feed, which do not move for the remainder of the video. Subject appears significantly injured, possibly suffering from unspecified vertebral trauma and very likely a concussion. After a moment, subject speaks off camera, his voice slurred and somewhat hoarse.//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-7820:** //Fucking do it, you four-legged-//
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject is cut off by a wet thump, followed by a cracking sound. The feed records silence for some time and does not detect any movement until the camera suddenly jostles and is lost. Contact with D-7820 is not reestablished, subject is presumed dead.//

&gt; **Notes:** In order to test the far limits of SCP-3311 in a safe and efficient manner, Exploration 3311-C was conducted with a small battery-powered drone capable at travelling at speeds of up to 35 km/hr. Drone was retrofitted with a custom servomotor attachment that would automatically place relays every 10km past the current range of 313km.
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; //Incursion into SCP-3311 was uneventful, the drone passing the point where D-7820 had removed a chair from its compartment. The instance of SCP-3311-1 was seen now back in its respective place, the glass still broken and missing from the door to its container.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Drone is directed into SCP-3311 for the next several hours until it reaches the 200km point. No foreign chairs or changes in layout are observed. Air samples are taken and proven to be identical to the quality just inside SCP-3311.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Continuing to the 300km point, the remains of D-7820&#39;s effects were found. The camera was noted to have been crushed by exceptional force and nearly flattened. The remainder of the items are seen strewn about. No sign of subject is detected.//
&gt; 
&gt; //The drone&#39;s servomotor attachment is activated and the first relay is placed without issue. Passing 380km, SCP-3311-1 instances started to vary greatly in size and shape. A large throne etched into luminous, purple crystal is recorded before the drone is directed further inside.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Approximately two hours later, the sound of light tapping is picked up in the audiovisual feed. Investigating, the drone is guided towards a compartment featuring a small, ambulatory chair less than 15cm high. The chair is seen galloping around its container and knocking on the glass with a tiny, birch leg.//
&gt; 
&gt; //After a few minutes, the drone is turned back on course. Further down, a compartment is seen with condensation growing on the interior. Approaching the glass panel, the camera revealed a mass of biological tissue in the rough shape of a bar stool. The stool seemed to pulsate intermittently as if breathing, but did not exhibit any other behavior. &#39;FLOOR MODEL&#39; is seen carved into the base.//
&gt; 
&gt; //The drone is piloted for another hour, passing the 400km point. Mild static interference is noted, with the buzzing noise returning and fading on occasion throughout. Sounds of scraping can be heard somewhere ahead.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Half an hour later, the drone is halted to observe a compartment which appeared completely overgrown and obscured by moss. The container next to it held a three-legged stool with only one leg, somehow supporting itself despite its condition.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Soon after, a soft and steady noise of unknown variety is picked up by the drone&#39;s microphone. Investigating, the machine is driven towards a large container featuring a nondescript couch. One of the cushions is pushed to the side, revealing an extradimensional structure, the space under the cushion descending downward into darkness. At this point, the noise was identified as surface waves, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4249 likely oceanic in nature]. The reason for this is unknown and still under debate.//
&gt; 
&gt; //The machine is piloted for ninety minutes without incident. Various thuds and scrapes can be heard, although no source is detected. Approximately 485km into the anomaly, a compartment containing the remains of D-7820 is discovered. Subject&#39;s body was contorted into the shape of a chair; his spine is seen bent at a perfect 90° angle halfway down, forming a seat. Ankles and wrists have been rotated 270° outward and are locked in place. The phrase &#39;FLOOR MODEL&#39; is carved into his ankle. The D-Class&#39; eyes are observed to be wide open, although he is unlikely to be alive.//
&gt; 
&gt; //After a few minutes, the drone is directed further inward. Passing the 500km mark, SCP-3311-1 instances are spotted that appear abstract and impossible for human sitting, returning to normal on occasion and without apparent order. A few possess parts of other chairs integrated seamlessly into their construction. An apparently two-dimensional loveseat is observed for some time, located next to a container bearing a single, floating cushion. 0.53 USD is spotted on the underside of the lumpy fabric as the drone is guided along.//
&gt; 
&gt; //The machine continued undeterred and without notable observations for another hour, until approaching a group of seven ordinary-looking dinner chairs, organized in a circle within the middle of the path. After some observation, the machine is navigated carefully around them. Upon panning back and focusing the camera on the group, the nearest chair was seen turning slowly to face the drone, which is piloted away.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Passing 500km from starting point, dozens of empty containers are seen throughout the unit, nearly all of which have been broken from the inside. The drone is maneuvered through the glass shards littering the path, and scraping noises are heard almost constantly. Movement is detected ahead which is revealed to be a single dinner chair repeatedly scratching its leg into the ground. It scampers away as the drone is piloted towards what  is believed to be a series of rudimentary pictographs depicting a number of stick figure chairs. The first drawing is observed to be a group of four chairs with a line over each, the second has the lines coming together to form another chair.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Drone is directed onward without note until just after the 525km mark, when a sudden rumble is heard, determined to be oncoming movement. A group of chairs is then seen rushing down the corridor in a stampede, one of which is tripped by the drone, resulting in a small collision. The machine is knocked onto its side and the feed is briefly severed. Link is reestablished approximately one minute later and the drone is righted with minimal effort.//
&gt; 
&gt; //The next hour of travel within SCP-3311 is completed quickly, although the buzzing noise continuously swelled in volume to the point where nothing else could be heard and the audio channel was muted. Interference is observed in the video feed, which is intermittently lost for a few seconds at a time, perhaps from relays being moved and/or damaged due to various contacts with chairs. The drone continued to record hundreds of shattered containers and a few notable instances of SCP-3311-1, such as one that appeared to be a fractal-structured gestalt comprised of further instances of SCP-3311-1, which also appeared to be comprised of SCP-3311-1, all similar but slightly different. Camera feed quality was not sufficient to observe in greater detail, but it is to note that the chairs comprising this particular instance displayed evidence of specialization,[[footnote]]The delegation of tasks and essential functions to individual components of a colony or host structure.[[/footnote]] reminiscent of siphonophorae.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Upon passing the 585km point, an antique chaise lounge was found blocking most of the path. The drone is turned and maneuvered to the wall in an attempt to pilot around it, but is quickly hampered by an unknown means- most likely from being &#34;stepped on&#34; by the object. The lounge was not heavy enough to cause structural damage but prevented further movement. The furnishing remained on the drone for several minutes before the feed is inexplicably lost for no apparent reason. Reconnection with drone is unsuccessful for several hours, during which time the relay network was confirmed as fully functioning. When the video feed is reestablished, the drone is found to have been relocated to the interior of a sealed compartment several dozen kilometers back. Unable to leave the container, the drone remained functioning for another twelve hours before the battery fully drained and the machine was considered lost.// 

**Incident Log 3311.1:**

On ██/██/████, eight days after Exploration Log 3311-C, a copy of D-7820&#39;s remains was discovered in a prepackaged box originally belonging to a ████████-brand office chair. The cadaver was sealed and compressed between the Styrofoam molding. Attempts to trace the origins of the package have ended in failure. Remains did not possess a &#34;Floor model&#34; inscription but DNA testing has confirmed it to be a 99.8% match to D-7820.

**Addendum 3311.2 Interview Logs:**



[[collapsible show=&#34;+ ACCESS INTVW-3311-A.log&#34; hide=&#34;- hide&#34;]]
&gt; **__Interview 3311-A__**
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. A. Hoffman
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** Records indicate that the storage unit had been in the ownership of one Raymond ████████, 67, for the past fifteen years, before which it had gone unused since the facility&#39;s inception. ████████, now referred to as POI-3311, was taken into Foundation custody before being amnesticised and returned to the general public.
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** So, you finally came for me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hoffman:** You were expecting us?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** Aye. Took you long enough.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hoffman:** I suppose we can skip the formalities if you know why we are here. Please, if you would, explain how the unit ended up in your possession?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** The what?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hoffman:** The storage unit.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** Pardon?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hoffman:** [Dr. Hoffman is heard leafing through some papers.] It says here you&#39;ve owned this storage unit at the, uh, ██████████ Storage facility since 2003. You know? It&#39;s full of chairs?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** Oh, //oh//, is that why you are here?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hoffman:** I&#39;m sorry, but what did you think we were here about?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** [shifts nervously in seat] Nothing, never mind.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hoffman:** //Okay//, then. [cough] Moving on. What can you tell us about the chairs?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** [pauses] Uh, well, what is there to talk about, really? It&#39;s just doing its thing, I left it alone a long time ago.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hoffman:** So, you were aware of the condition of the unit?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** Yeah, well, not at first. I was certain there was something off about the first guy, but I&#39;m not about to stop one chair from fulfilling its dream of becoming God.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hoffman:** I&#39;m sorry? The first chair?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** I mean, it has to start somewhere, right? Anyway, all it really wanted was to create. This chair was bigger than other chairs. Metaphysically larger. It embodied the concept to its fullest extent. There was never a time where it could not be defined as a chair, and that certainty was so potent, it began to impart that quality on other things, just like other things had imparted the quality of life unto itself. Like conceptual osmosis.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hoffman:** Alright... I&#39;m following you so far.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** I got that unit so it would have some work space. Left it to its own devices because I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what it would have wanted.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hoffman:** Then why did you stop paying for the unit?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** Well, uh [quietly] to be honest, I don&#39;t have a lot of money right now. It isn&#39;t mad at me, is it? Y-you aren&#39;t going to evict the thing, are you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hoffman:** The unit has been acquired by us and is safely partitioned from the public eye. 
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** [sighs] Okay, good.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hoffman:** Were you aware that the entity was creating copies of chairs that already existed?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** Copies? I don&#39;t know about you, but anything I&#39;ve ever seen it make was one hundred percent original. It only made demo models. Concepts. Artsy bugger, always trying new things, always stretching what it means to be a chair. It all sounds silly, but, you take away the object and you see a force behind it, a true power. And a //need//.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hoffman:** What kind of need?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** A need to propagate and survive. To weave itself into the framework of everything. There were times around it that I started to ask myself if I was a chair. It made so much sense in the middle of it, and it only grew with the number of creations it made. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hoffman:** What kept you from reporting this to the authorities?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** [laughs] I barely believe you are taking me seriously, let alone the //cops//.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hoffman:** Fair enough.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** It&#39;s so strange to see the lines that separate things blur. Your mind can&#39;t comprehend it. It accepts and rejects its reality simultaneously. After the shock of change fades, you grow used to it, and it becomes a part of you. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hoffman:** I see. Thank you, Mr. ████████, you have been very enlightening.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** You&#39;re welcome. Oh, and, before you go. Can I ask you something?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hoffman:** Sure.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** You&#39;ve been inside the unit?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hoffman:** We have, yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** When you were in there, you didn&#39;t by chance see any other chairs that happened to be... alive?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Hoffman:** Alive in what sense?
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** It&#39;s probably nothing, but- I don&#39;t know. [pause] I&#39;ve always felt like it wanted to create more than just chairs. It wanted to impart //life//. After all, that was its sole other property. If it can make things into chairs, I fear it could make things live. I don&#39;t know how I&#39;d feel about something like that.
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject is seen briefly checking the chair underneath him.//
&gt; 
&gt; **POI-3311:** Can&#39;t trust anything these days.
