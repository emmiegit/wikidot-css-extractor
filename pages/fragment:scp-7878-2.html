SCP-7878
[[/div]]

**Item #:** SCP-7878

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** All three of SCP-7878 are contained by I in different Foundation Sites and Areas. I believe no other Containment Procedures are necessary.

**Description:** SCP-7878 is Machina-V, a large mechanical device consisting of multiple anomalous components, including but not limited to: Bright/Zartion Hominid Replicators (BZHR), Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor (LFTR), and a Human Noospheric Regulator (HNR).

SCP-7878 is used to produce non-anomalous humans connected by the HNR.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Foreword:** Recorded footage of security camera of Site-19.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

//Siegel Aaron is seen entering into the camera&#39;s view, at the main entrance of the Site//
//He presses the doorbell, and the camera placed upward on the wall of the building turns in his direction. Someone responds through the speakers placed just under the doorbell button.//
 
**Speaker:** Yes?

**Aaron:** I need to talk to the individual named &#34;The Administrator&#34;.

**Speaker:** Please wait.

//After twenty seconds, the doors open. A tall man in his mid-30s wearing a Foundation labcoat appears. The Foundation&#39;s logo is seen on his shoulder.//

**Aaron**: Administrator.

**William:** Aaron! Good to see you, how have you been? It&#39;s been, what, two years?

**Aaron:** Three. I think it would be better to talk inside, if that&#39;s okay.

**William:** Of course, come in!

//Both Siegel and Frederick enter the Site. They are greeted by MTF guards, whose helmets hide their faces.//
//Next they enter the main hallway. As they pass a group of people, Siegel notices they all look the same as William Frederick.//

**Aaron:** So the rumours are true; you did clone yourself.

**William:** Yes. The guy you heard through the speaker, MTFs, and researchers are all me.

**Aaron:** And how many are you?

**William:** More than one hundred thousand in all Sites. I don&#39;t know the exact count.

**Aaron:** That&#39;s... wow.

**William:** Impressive isn&#39;t it? This body you&#39;re talking to is the 97th clone here, the closest we have from the original.

**Aaron:** ...how exactly did you manage all of this?

**William:** Very simple actually. Right that way.

//Both individuals continue walking in the hallway until they stop at a large white door. &#34;SCP-7878&#34; can be seen written in black on the door.//

**Aaron:** SCP-7878?

**William:** Not exactly. It’s far different from the one you saw the day you left. I, in a way, upgraded it.

//The doors open, revealing a spacious room with a large machine in the middle. Moving parts such as enormous gears, springs or wires can be seen outside of the machine.//
//Multiple booths are seen at the bottom of the engine, and clones of Frederick William emerge out of the machine&#39;s entrance. Other clones can be seen working with solder masks, torches and wires on the sides of the enormous engine.//

**William:**  I used the knowledge we had with [[[SCP-2000 | 2000]]] and I created my own clone machine. Not only that, I did my own research on SCP-7878 and disassembled it, which helped me understand the Human Noosphere, as it was directly connected to it. With that knowledge, I created what I now call a &#34;Human Noosphere Regulator, &#34; meaning I can create a bubble inside the psychosphere, to which all my clones have access. A bubble so dense that I have the capability of having-

**Aaron:** -A hive-mind through all your clones.

**William:** Precisely. In three years, I was only able to make three of them, but I&#39;ll be damned if it wasn&#39;t worth it. While walking and talking with you, I am also working on constructing a new Site, fighting some eldritch horror as an MTF, or being sacrificed by myself to contain an entity from outside our baseline reality. To put it simply, I am everywhere. I do everything. All at once.

**Aaron:** What about the D-class? You don&#39;t use them anymore? What did you do to them?

**William:** No need. Several versions of me are used as the equivalent of a D-class. As for what I did to them, I simply sent them back [[[SCP-6111 | home]]].

**Aaron:** And population control?

**William:** I constantly use masks or plastic surgery in public to hide my identity.

**Aaron:** Cognitohazards? Antimemetics?

**William:** Clones in charge of mind-affecting anomalies are an exception; they are the only ones not connected to the Regulator.

**Aaron:** And what about-

**William:** I&#39;ll stop you there, Aaron. Believe me, everything is under control. We had not a single breach in the last year. When I say I&#39;ll take care of everything, I mean it.

**Aaron:** That&#39;s... yeah, that&#39;s not what I had in mind by &#34;very simple&#34;.

**William:** I know that&#39;s a lot to process, even for you. Come to my office, we&#39;ll discuss.

//Both Siegel and Frederick walk. They pass an office door, where several Frederick William are seen seated in front of computers, none of them are blinking or looking away from the computer screen while typing//

//They then enter the director&#39;s office of Site-19.//

**William:** Take a seat. Do you want something? Tea? Coffee? Water?

**Aaron:** Do you people have any breaks?

**William:** No. Except when we eat or sleep. Clones are unfortunately blocked by basic human needs. Anything at all?

**Aaron:** //&lt;While adjusting his seat&gt;// We still have whisky?

**William:** Whisky it is.

//Siegel lets out a long sigh, while Frederick takes the seat in front of him.//

**Aaron:** So. I wanted to talk about my //situation//.

**William:** Mmhmm.

**Aaron:** I- We got pushed out of my own Foundation in one single day. Without any explanation. Even though I was supposed to be the highest authority, just after you. All Foundation members were confused. You fired every department, division, cell, and all staff just because... you could?

**William:** I believe I said everything I had to say in that file.

**Aaron:** But did you? Did you really? I keep thinking about that file, I remember every word. But none of this makes sense, I wondered if you were infected by some anomaly, threatened, or if it was even you writing this? I mean-

//Siegel is interrupted by the doors of the office opened by a clone of Frederick. He then puts a glass of whisky and a cup of apple juice onto a table in front of them.//

**Aaron:** …Apple juice?

**Both Frederick William:** My favourite.

//The second clone leaves.//
//Silence between the two, Frederick drinks his cup while Siegel looks intensely as if he is searching for something to say.//

**Aaron:** I’ve never seen you in person now that I think about it. I’ve called you more than a thousand times, through a screen or just the voice, but you never got out of this bunker you call an &#34;office&#34;. Your devotion to this job is amazing. I admired you.

And one day, you just decided to fire all of us. No overseer vote, no Ethics Committee recommendation, no nothing. I didn&#39;t even think it would be remotely possible.

But I trusted you. I thought it would just be temporary or something. So, when I left the Foundation, I tried to live a normal life, as you asked. What used to be my family is long gone,  since I’ve lived for more than 100 years and the grandsons I have left never heard of me. So I tried instead to live in Venice, Italy, my favourite place of all. It didn&#39;t take me long to find someone. A beautiful man with brown chestnut hair, green eyes reminding me of the peaceful wildlife and a smile forcing you to do the same back. Pretty smart, even if a bit stupid when he wants to. He was named Jarell. Jarell Moran.

//Siegel takes a big sip of his whisky glass.//

**Aaron:** I really did love him. But even so, there was something missing. A part of me that isn&#39;t there anymore, a gap that keeps getting wider every day. The thought that this departure was temporary disappeared after the first year. But even though, I stayed with Jarell for two other years. I would wake up at night, unable to sleep back, and instead, work on procedures I couldn’t finish before leaving my work. After all this time together, he wanted to be married, and have children, but I couldn&#39;t go this far. I left him. I told him to find someone better than me. Because I knew deep down this life wasn’t for me.

I tried living on my own, alone. But it was worse. The periods of sleep were getting shorter, and the memories of The Foundation were screaming back into my mind. The gap got wider and wider until I was nothing but that gap. And that&#39;s when...

//Siegel looks directly at the man beside him.//

**Aaron:** That&#39;s when I came back here. To refill that gap. I want to rejoin the Foundation.

**William:** Siegel, look...

**Aaron:** I&#39;ll join whatever department you want. Whatever clearance.

**William:** There is no clearance anymore. And a single man detached from the Noospheric bubble is an entire revision to this system that I&#39;ve built.

**Aaron:** I&#39;ll join the bubble too. Connect my brain to it, I know that&#39;s possible!

**William:** No. I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s a huge risk to take for your brain and I don&#39;t want another life taken because of me.

**Aaron:** Then, put me in charge of mind-affecting anomalies!

**William:** Those are the worst type of anomalies. And like I said, I don&#39;t want to put any of you into trouble because of me again.

//Frederick sigh, takes a sip of the apple juice cup and looks back at Siegel.//

**William:** ...To be entirely truthful with you. You are not the first to come here. Other Foundation members came back here this year. Having the urge to //refill// that hole in them, as you say. I re-sent them back home and told them to keep trying to have the life they should have.

**Aaron:** …But //why//? Why do all of this when there are people who want to help the Foundation!  If you truly cared for us, you would let us back in, //especially// since a lot of us wanted to do so! What if there are some people whose life is to be in the Foundation! Helping others!

**William:** I do not believe such a thing. The Foundation is not a life, you&#39;ve all been brainwashed to think so, with how long and hard you&#39;ve been working.

**Aaron:** Then what about //you//, William. Why haven&#39;t you tried having a family, if you think of this place that way?

**William:** For the necess-

**Aaron:** No! No more of this bullshit! You&#39;re no god, you don&#39;t have to be the martyr of all of us just because you want to! You&#39;re just forcing yourself to make us a victim! Open your fucking eyes William!

//Silence.//
//Siegel finishes his whisky with one last swallow.//

**Aaron:** ...It was a mistake coming here. I should have done what I came here for.

//Siegel stands up, rolls up his sleeve and presses a button on his watch.//

**William:** What are you talking about? Why…

//Frederick&#39;s facial expression changes from confused to surprised, and angered.//

**William:** Did you-

**Aaron:** You already know the answer.

//A large explosion is heard far away in the Site.//

------
= **[Camera Footage in Gate B entrance of Site-19]**

//Individuals are seen at the entrance, sticking what seems to be a large quantity of C-4 bombs on the door. Multiple former Foundation members are recognized.//

//They then walk away and activate the bombs, destroying the door and leaving a large hole.//

//After the dust of the explosion wears off, twenty other agents armed with rifles enter the Site and immediately start shooting at the clones.//

//One agent, seeing the cameras, shoots them off.//

= **[End of Camera Footage]**
------

**Aaron:** …I knew about the other members who wanted to rejoin The Foundation. So I called all of them. But we couldn&#39;t make our own organization. We don&#39;t have the money or influence of before. But you did. We first tried to talk you out. Hundreds of former members tried to convince you to get the Foundation back like before. We tried for one entire year, in vain. I was supposed to be your last chance at convincing you. And since you refused again, our patience has finally run out. So, we decided together, to take back the Foundation. Make it the same as it should be.

//Frederick quickly tries to get up, but Siegel pulls out a gun and shoots both of his legs. While he screams in pain, Siegel points the gun in direction of Frederick’s head but doesn’t shoot yet.//

**Aaron:** It should be pretty easy. Even if your original body is almost immortal, I know damn well that the clones are not. You also have this &#34;moral code&#34; which blocks you from trying to hurt a Foundation member, even less to achieve your own goal. That&#39;s why the Ethics Committee was created, to make choices you couldn&#39;t. You are &#34;The Protector&#34; after all!

**William:** //&lt;panting&gt;// You’ve gone crazy.

**Aaron:** Maybe I have. Maybe we all have. But this is on you.

**William:** //&lt;coughing &gt;// Siegle, you-

//Siegel fires, Clone#97 is terminated.//

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

[[/div]]

**Incident Prime - Site-19:** Following Aaron Siegel&#39;s interview, more than 200 former Foundation Personnel attacked Site-19 using several weapons, some being anomalous. During the assault, I did not tried to fight back, instead I attempted to evacuate Site-19 while carrying a maximum capacity of anomalous items, files and potentially dangerous weapons. Attempts at talking with the former Foundation members were done, but all were deemed unsuccessful.

I believe 23 of the 4936 clones of Site-19 have successfully evacuated the place in time, the rest has been terminated.
