**Item #:** SCP-1393

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The property surrounding SCP-1393, formerly owned by the J.W. and Sons Corporation, is to be designated Site-97.  Mobile Task Force Beta-7 (aka &#34;Maz Hatters&#34;) are to be tasked with cleanup operations and onsite security.  --SCP-1393 is to be buried with an adequate amount of earth as to neutralize its active effect.--  Material produced by SCP-1393 is to be handled as detailed in the standard protocols for extrinsic hazardous materials.  

The material will need to be mixed with moist clay earth at a ratio of 3:1 before being hauled away to be properly disposed of on site.  Disposal will consist of hauling the material to the NW corner of Site-97 and spread across the ground.  Once cooled, a 30cm layer of clay earth will be spread on top.  Future reclamation plans will consist of converting Site-97 into a shipping container storage yard once cleanup operations have completed.

Samples of the material produced by SCP-1393 will need to be collected and sent to Research Site-45 for scheduled bi-weekly testing.  

**Description:** SCP-1393 is a spherical portal measuring 1.8m in diameter and positioned 10cm above the ground.  SCP-1393 has remained active since Feb. 17^^th^^, 2013 (2 days after its initial sighting).  While active, SCP-1393 continually exudes a partially vitreous slag-like substance from its surface at rate of 12m^^3^^/hr.  This material&#39;s temperature has been measured to range between 1,500°C and 1,800°C.  Roughly 85% of this material is primarily composed of a combination of silica, quicklime, alumina, sodium borate, and magnesite.  Traces of mercury, uranium, phosphorous, sulfur, radium, and other toxic elements in varying amounts have also been detected.   

Before SCP-1393 entered its current active state, a humanoid being designated SCP-1393-1 was observed performing reconnaissance and surveying of the immediate area.  SCP-1393-1 was reported wearing a Level A/Type 1 Hazmat suit equipped with a polarized face shield and a SCBA unit.  The Foundation was contacted about the event and SCP-1393-1 was interviewed about its actions and purpose.  To date, SCP-1393-1 has not been seen since SCP-1393 activated.

Similarities between SCP-1393 and [[[SCP-364]]] have been noted. Factoring in [[[SCP-2493|SCP-2493-1&#39;s]]] account, it suggests the possibility of extra-dimensional disposal of materials as a common practice.
