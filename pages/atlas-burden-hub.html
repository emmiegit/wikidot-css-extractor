In the Library, there are stories told of a peculiar man who walks not among the bookshelves and statues of the halls of the Great Libary, but walks among the cliffs and crags of the vast multiverse.  He is said to seek knowledge in the material, to discover and return what the Library does not hold, and to tell the stories of those who cannot tell their own.  Now, rumors state he is a wanderer in the Lands Unclean, searching for his next story...

[[tab The Lands Unclean]]
++++ Overview:

The Lands Unclean has come to mean the particularly world in which the story of Atlas&#39; Burden plays out.  The Lands Unclean were never a peaceful place by any means, continually ravaged by the scars of war and the latent powers of ancient magics.  The land is coated in mist, and what people do remain seek to eke out a meager living by farming the less-than-fertile soil, plumbing the depths for mineral wealth, or engaging in trade between the largest remaining bastions of civilization.  

-----

++++ History:

The Lands Unclean has, for most of its history, been under dominion of The Worm.  The Worm is a deity of decay and rot, which spreads its influence through disease and sickness, both of land and of body.  This changed, about 3000 years before the present day, when a vampyric force betrayed The Worm and spread mist throughout the lands, allowing vampyrs to once again regain control of the surface.  The power struggle between the vampyric forces and the forces of decay and worms has continued ever since, though at the time both sides have lost considerable strength.  Rumors of a new outbreak of wormrot have been heard amongst the more spiritual in the villages, though...

-----

++++ Notable Locations:

There are, as far as we are aware, two major bastions of life left in the Lands Unclean.

**Tuskini**:
The land least effected by the encroaching mists, Tuskini is the agricultural center of the continent.  Most food is grown here, and the population mostly consists of farmers and supporting personnel.  Many guards are, as well, trained here.  Lt. Valentina Eckhart grew up in and graduated from a school in Tuskini.
Due to its low-lying and desirable nature, the city of Tuskini must maintain a vigilant watch , or else it will find itself falling beneath the cloud of mist and monsters which blankets the surrounding landscape.

**Raven**:
The greatest Dwarven industrial center left standing, the city of Raven is built atop a great mountain, supported by the bones of a long-forgotten gargantuan entity.  The city is quite advanced, encircled by channels and rivers of molten iron, steel, and copper to feed the factories and fend off the bitter cold.  The height of the mountain Raven sits on protects it from the mists, though some believe the mists have been rising further and further up the great slopes...
[[/tab]]
[[tab Corbenic Leander Atlas]]
A mysterious man with even more mysterious origins, Atlas is an enigma to most.  This reputation is not entirely befitting to his nature, though, as he is, in reality, a quite simple being.  Tasked with reclaiming knowledge where it has been lost or hidden, Atlas seeks to bring those stories to light.  Gifted with investigative skills to match his sturdy frame (after all, he //is// part giant), Atlas tracks down stories lost in the most dangerous of places.  Due to this fact, he has found his work in the Lands Unclean, a place where few other wanderers would wish to go.
[[/tab]]
[[tab Lt. Valentina Eckhart]]
A native to the Lands Unclean, Lt. Valentina Eckhart was once a simple city guard in Tuskini.  She had grown up tending to the land on the outskirts of the city, and spent her teenage years training in the local military academy, until she had landed a position in the local militia.  Her parents, guards themselves, could not be more proud.  When a few odd adventurers came to town one day, though, she found herself swept up in a conspiracy, adventure, and horror story all at once.  One infection of wormrot later, and Valentina left to continue her adventure, forever leaving behind the home she had once known.
Rumor has it, Valentina was an Awoken.  What an Awoken is, or why they matter, is still unknown.
