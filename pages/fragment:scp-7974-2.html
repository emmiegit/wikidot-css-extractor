**Item #:** SCP-7974
 
**Object Class:** Euclid
 
**Special Containment Procedures:**  A containment zone has been established between the former office of Ian Vance and the newly reconstructed hallway to the northern wing of Site-74, including the office itself. All hallways leading into the containment zone are currently in the process of being walled off and a make-shift secure entrance is being created for testing purposes. 

D-Class testing is to start at the beginning of each week and result in at least one victim, creating a temporary safe zone for a period of at least 20 hours.[[footnote]] These periods of time have varied but have yet to exceed 40 hours. [[/footnote]] During this period of time, Site-74 personnel are instructed to move any anomalous or otherwise important objects from the remainder of the northern wing. Salt barriers, protective sigils, and banishment wards are to be utilized in the area surrounding the containment zone to increase the duration of the safe period. One (1) D-Class personnel must refresh these protective elements daily, in accordance with the guidelines set by Site-74&#39;s medium, Imogen Calloway.

**Description:** SCP-7974 is a non-sentient supernatural entity, believed to be the spirit of former Senior Researcher Ian Vance, who was killed in a containment breach 8 months prior to the first documented sighting of SCP-7974. SCP-7974 has been shown to recreate the moments of its death at irregular intervals. These events have been shown to last no longer than 15 minutes, and occur in the area between the former office of Ian Vance and the newly reconstructed hallway to the northern wing of Site-74. 

Any personnel in the direct path between the two locations during an SCP-7974 Bludgeoning event will suffer intense blunt force trauma resulting in their death. Injury patterns have been shown to be unique to the space the victim is occupying between the two locations, indicating that two victims standing in the same location during two separate events will result in nearly identical injuries sustained, with variations to be expected in regards to muscle mass and body type. This was later confirmed via D-Class testing. 

Due to the current layout of the northern wing entrance, Bludgeoning events are able to be witnessed by outside observers, and updated construction will provide a viewing area for testing. Camera and audio equipment within range during a Bludgeoning event will likely fail, producing static, warping images, or shutting off completely. As has been noted with previous paranormal anomalies, inconsistent battery life has been noted during any SCP-7974 activity.

**Addendum-1:** Discovery 
On January 16th, 2021, Site Director Israel Ray was found crushed to death in front of the office of Ian Vance. An investigation was launched into his death, limiting personnel entry to the area. An autopsy suggested the cause of death via blunt force trauma in line with being crushed by falling rubble. All camera footage of the event was highly distorted, which lead to the investigation concluding the event was paranormal in nature. MTF-59 “Greater Ghost” was sent to investigate the area more thoroughly during non-operational hours.

**Addendum-2:** Initial Investigation Event Summary
 
&gt; **Event Overview:** 
&gt; //Four members of MTF-59 (hereby referred to as Ghost-1, Ghost-2, Ghost-3, &amp; Ghost-4[[footnote]] Spiritual Medium, Imogen Calloway [[/footnote]]) arrive at Site-74 at 2:45am on January 23, 2021. This event summary has been compiled using the surviving body cam footage along with the testimony of the remaining member of MTF-59.//
&gt;
&gt;

&gt; **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **3:00:45** Door is unlocked by the newly promoted SCP-7974 lead, Dr. Clemons. MTF-59 enters and begins preparing their ghost hunting equipment. 
&gt; 
&gt; **3:01:12** Clemons locks the doors of Site-74 before entering a nearby security van to watch Site-74 cameras and to keep contact over a handheld radio transceiver. 
&gt; 
&gt; **3:10:52** Investigation officially begins outside of Ian Vance’s former office. Ghost-4 senses minor spirit activity. Spirit Box and EMF reader remain silent. 
&gt; 
&gt; **3:13:04** Office door is approached and opened. MTF-59 enters. Ghost-4 states that she feels “a much stronger ghost presence”, and beginning to remove an item from her belt.[[footnote]] This item was later determined to be Anomalous Item-13, a minor protective charm [[/footnote]] 
&gt; 
&gt; **3:13:05** The office door is slammed open and loud footsteps can be heard. This sudden noise causes Ghost-4 to rush outside, causing the newly loosened item on her belt to fall off. Ghost-1 &amp; -3 rush out of the office. Security camera footage begins to distort, but the image is still mostly visible.  
&gt; 
&gt; **3:13:24** Dr. Clemens attempts contact to no avail. Ghost-4 begins to follow a &#34;ghostly apparition&#34; asking questions with a spirit box as she walks forward, followed by Ghost-1 &amp; -3.
&gt; 
&gt; **3:14:16** Ghost-2 remains in the office with the EMF reader. It flashes a few times before shutting off. Ghost-2 goes to replace the batteries, before finding Anomalous Item-13 which had fallen under the desk.
&gt; 
&gt; **3:15:34** Ghost-4 is located approximately 45ft from the hallway. The camera then begins to distort, causing the image over the hallway to become obfuscated.
&gt; 
&gt; **3:16:02** A large series of cracks are heard as Ghost-3 falls to the floor in a pile of blood[[footnote]] Later examination would prove the cause of death to be blunt force trauma, similar to those caught under rubble doing natural disasters. [[/footnote]]. Ghost-4 begins chanting and is joined by Ghost-1. Ghost-1&#39;s chanting turns to screams as the left side of his body begins to cave in, causing blood and viscera to exit his mouth. All cameras in the area shut off simultaneously.
&gt; 
&gt; **3:16:20** Ghost-2 arrives to see Ghost-4 fall to the ground as the chanting stops. [[footnote]] Later D-class testing would show this area to consistently affect the neck and upper chest first.  [[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **3:16:24** Ghost-2 continues the chanting, holding Anomalous Item-13 in front of him. Ghost-2&#39;s right tibia leg snaps in half, causing him to fall onto his stomach. 
&gt; 
&gt; **3:16:28** Ghost-2 finishes his chant before going into shock.
&gt; 
&gt; **3:20:05** Dr. Clemons sends in a medical retrieval team who finds Ghost-2 alive and quickly escorts him to the medical wing of Site-74 for emergency medical care.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;END LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Event Outcome:** Ghost-2 survived the initial attack but was found to be suffering from nearly complete body paralysis as several vertebrae in his spine were crushed before the cessation of the SCP-7974 Bludgeoning Event. Interviews utilizing an eye-operated communication device were able to piece together his experience of the event.

Following Bludgeoning Event 7974-1, the current containment procedures went into effect. Due to the aggressive nature of SCP-7974 prior to the event, Imogen Calloway left instructions on effective spiritual practices to help contain SCP-7974.
