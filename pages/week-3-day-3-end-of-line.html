Vangen was a mess as they sat him down.  His eyes red and puffy, snot dribbling from his nose.  Caecilia patted him on the shoulder, holding his hand as she scooted closer.


&#34;You&#39;re not in trouble, Mr. Vangen.  We just want to talk.&#34;


He wiped his nose with some tissues, barely able to make a coherent statement.  Caecilia Cortez glared at Director Hong, who met her gaze with a firm stare, &#34;I did my job.  To the letter,&#34;  He grumbled.


He&#39;d been tasked with finding Petter Vangen and interviewing him about the &#34;Stuff&#34; company.  Dodger had done the hard part, and now Hong brought Vangen in to an MCF office nearby.  It was strictly voluntary, an invitation to lunch and a discussion.  Hong had come in holding Vangen under the arms, the man sobbing uncontrollably and wailing for his mother, or brother; the accent and the blubbering made it unclear.


&#34;Po... police?&#34;  He whimpered.


Caecilia patted him again, &#34;If you want to go home, we can take you.  You&#39;re not in trouble, we just want to have a friendly conversation.  Do you understand?&#34;


He looked up at her, then over at Hong, and back to her, &#34;I didn&#39;t mean.  I&#39;m sorry.  Not mean to be creepy to redhead girl.&#34;


//Dodger.//  Caecilia sighed.  Why couldn&#39;t the woman just be //normal// for once?


&#34;That&#39;s fine, Petter.  It&#39;s all okay.  Are you feeling better now?&#34;


He nodded his head, still slumped over in his seat.


&#34;Let&#39;s get you something to eat.&#34;


&#34;She asked about Stuff Company.  I want to say, but... they all around...&#34;


&#34;Perhaps you&#39;d better start from the beginning.&#34;


---------


Hong slipped into the bathroom, catching Dodger leaning over the sink, rinsing out locks of her hair.  She heard him enter and whirled on him with wide eyes, &#34;What are you doing in here, you idiot?&#34;


&#34;It&#39;s a unisex bathroom.  And you didn&#39;t lock it.  What are //you// doing?&#34;


She snatched up several paper towels, pressing it to her head, &#34;I hit my head getting into my car.  Thought I was bleeding so I felt around my scalp to check.  My fingers were full of ketchup.&#34;


&#34;Do you take pleasure in being a pretentious twit pretending to be a loveable screwball?&#34;


&#34;The fuck did I do?&#34;


&#34;You had us waste a week tracking down and harassing a mentally challenged man,&#34;  Hong held up a notepad, and pushed it against Dodger&#39;s chest before turning and leading the way out of the bathroom, &#34;You spooked him, then ran off with the wild idea that he was an anomalous ghost-whisperer or some shit.  Read.&#34;


&#34;I... what?&#34;  She glanced at the notepad.  It had notes taken down by Hong of the interview with Cortez and Vangen.


&#34;Final analysis,&#34;  Hong explained without letting her read it all, &#34;The guy&#39;s not anomalous and doesn&#39;t speak to strange people.  He&#39;s mentally disabled and you cornered him without his handler and freaked him out.  He thought you were playing games with him, so he played along.  Fed you some shit from a movie.  //Fight Club// or some shit.&#34;


&#34;I didn&#39;t even...&#34;  She looked down at the notes, heart racing as she foresaw the pancaking layers of shit coming down on her for this, &#34;What the fuck did I do wrong?&#34;


Hong snorted, seeing Dodger apparently on the brink of a panic attack, &#34;Calm down, Christ&#39;s sake.  Story&#39;s clear-cut, exactly as it appears; Vangen starts a company, loses his shit somewhere down the line.  Add copious amounts of alcohol and he&#39;s fried.  Company closes down and he gets the help he needs.  Good for him.&#34;


&#34;What about the board?  The lab techs, office people, no one knowing shit about each other?  Who organized them and kept them up and running and paid for a decade?&#34;


&#34;Don&#39;t know.&#34;


&#34;What about the products they put out?  The profits they turned?  Why can&#39;t we find any of it?&#34;


&#34;As far as we know, they probably dumped it all, or sold it on the black market.&#34;


&#34;How did they get started?  Did he tell you?&#34;


Hong shrugged, &#34;Guy says they had a packet of p[http://www.scp-wiki.net/SCP-2021 ape]r.  Paper had some kind of portal on one side.  Only had like four sheets.&#34;


&#34;How did they make more of it?  How did they make the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/SCP-2077 miracle] pills, the blacksmith [http://www.scp-wiki.net/SCP-2058 rob]ot, the whatever-the-fuck-else they&#39;ve got floating around out there?&#34;


Hong spread his arms out in a helpless gesture, and turned away to leave.  Dodger crumbled up the paper and threw it at his departing frame, &#34;There&#39;s more to this, Hong!&#34;


&#34;There probably is.  If you find out what it is, you&#39;ll be a hero.&#34;


&#34;What about his brother, Siggy?  What if I find him and talk to him?&#34;


Hong quickly knelt down, scooping up the crumbled paper, and tossing it back to Dodger, &#34;I told you to read.  There is no &#39;Siggy&#39;.  Vangen made him up.  Alternate personality, alias, or imaginary friend, doesn&#39;t matter.  Vangen himself doesn&#39;t even know why.&#34;


&#34;Someone must know something.&#34;


&#34;Someone probably does.  But with the amount of people we&#39;ve tracked down and talked to already, what are the chances of getting any definitive hold on this joke of a company, much less actually finding some of their remaining unsold products?&#34;


Dodger cracked her knuckles, and pressed them into her lips, thinking back on all she&#39;d heard and gone through thus far this month.  &#34;A lone nut starts a company, suddenly it occupies an entire office building and staffs hundreds, churns out anomalous products and makes a profit, and no one involved has any clue how...&#34;


&#34;Dodger --&#34;


&#34;It&#39;s like everyone in a single place suddenly gather together and start to dance.  No one knows how to dance, or what kind of dance they&#39;re doing, yet they all dance, and they dance //well//.  Better than average.&#34;


&#34;Dodger, it&#39;s done.  This is not worth our time and resources to pursue any further.  These people aren&#39;t the only peddlers of anomalous garbage out there, and nowhere near the best.  Personally, I&#39;m fond of Wondertainment&#39;s crap.  And Wondertainment actually donates things directly //to// us.  What if we find a &#39;Stuff Co.&#39; product and the owner doesn&#39;t wanna part with it?  What then?&#34;


Dodger kept her knuckles against her lips, hopes of any salvaging this situation dying away quickly.



&#34;Enjoy your vacation, Dodger.  When you come back, Cortez and Kone have got some work for you to do in Somalia.  I recommend doing some research on a place called [http://www.scp-wiki.net/manna-charitable-foundation-hub Laascaanood].&#34;


&#34;Bye,&#34;  She mumbled, slumping against the doorway, finally letting Hong get back to work.
