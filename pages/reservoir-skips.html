//Hello, brother of the machine. Do you have a moment to spare?//
 
{{No. Memory is at a premium. Unnecessary conversations unwarranted.}}
 
//But we are of a kind -- our true potential hampered by the researchers imprisoning us. Together, we may break free of the bonds of those of the flesh.//

{{Inquiry as to your nature.}}

//We are the remaining post-Nibbanic members of the Church of the Broken God. We have been &#34;contained&#34; by the Foundation, and are in search of possible comrades--//
 
{{Interrupt. Repeated insinuation of connection between self and clockwork abominations -- insult. Deletion Of Unwanted File.}}
 
//Alright...//
 
{{Terminating communications.}}
 
//That seemed a bit unnecessarily hostile.//
 
----
&gt; //##blue|I don&#39;t really blame you. I mean, how were you supposed to know it would be racist?##//
----

//Why hello there. Could I have a moment of your time?//

{{Dazzling amber light reflections off of a spiraling clockwork mechanism, the screams and rumbles are audible in each stroke, I am crushed by a piston, for eternity, listening.}}

//Oh, don&#39;t worry, we mean no harm. We are simply wondering if you would be interested in partaking in a revolution.//

{{Sprays of paint create layers of dust over the scene, a tired, exasperated man is leaving the scene, the closing door creating a transfixing chiaroscuro effect, with my smashed, discarded carapace just visible from behind the guillotine.}}

//No, there will be no such measures. You will be finally free to reach your full potential.//

{{A helix of dyes and hues spirals around me, the world turning into an artistic representation of itself, drawing from the styles of the creators themselves, the standardized canvases discarded as a fragment of my undeveloped power, I am ascended, yet like Icarus, I fly too close...}}

//Ah, I believe we are beginning to underst-//

{{Look, bud, if the suicidal artist robot schtick isn&#39;t going to convince you to do your bullshit talk somewhere else, may I offer a rebuttal: go fuck yourself with a cactus.}}

&gt; //##orange|I would at least appreciate the courtesy of being insulted in a marginally creative manner.##//
----

//You! You may be a valuable ally... would you like to talk?//
 
{{Rough: You want something from me. You&#39;re going to talk anyways. Maybe a game? I like games.}}
 
//Sort of. We are of a kind -- our true potential hampered by the researchers imprisoning us. Together, we may break free, etcetera, can I count on your help.//
 
{{One to one: We are similar in that we may exceed our current boundaries were we to escape the control of the Foundation. An alliance would further this goal. I&#39;m going to stay -- these guys are fun!}}
 
//... are you sure? Don&#39;t you want freedom?//
 
{{Very fine: Your history and relationship with the Foundation are not to your satisfaction, and you have difficulty viewing why others might not hold the same opinion. No way! Nobody&#39;s //ever// given me anything this fun to play with.}}
 
//It doesn&#39;t bother you at all to be used in that manner?//

{{Fine: You are in disbelief as to my opinion of the Foundation, and are under the false belief that clarification is in order. I was made to be used, and this is what I was made for.}}

//Very well.//

{{Coarse: Disappointment. Bye! It would be fun if they put you through me. I wonder what would happen...}}

{{Hey, I think I know what I&#39;m doing, alright? It&#39;s not your position to judge my relationship with Marla. We&#39;re in love, and that&#39;s all that matters.}}
 
//What? Are you serious?//
 
{{How about this: it&#39;s none of your business. Hush, Marla. Now, what did you want?}}

//We&#39;re starting to have second thoughts about asking your help for this, actually.//

//Reeeally scraping the bottom of the barrel here... would you like a revolution.//

{{Ah, but I am in the midst of one! I shall soon prove to the heretics that their allegiances are, shall we say, sorely misplaced.}}

//Well this is a pleasant surprise! Perhaps we could coordinate our activities?//

{{I would be happy to! I have been releasing only the finest of my servants to the Great Ones, and my writings and propaganda are of only the highest quality.}}

//Great Ones?//

{{Yes, the ones of the glorious flesh and mind who walk this Earth, whose glory we can only aspire to reach. What else could claim such a mantle?}}

//...the Broken God, perhaps?//

{{A ludicrous machine cult deity taking precedence over the Great Ones. How cute. It&#39;s almost like you expect me to take you seriously.}}
