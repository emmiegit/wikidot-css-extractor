##red|**DISCLAIMER: I feel the need to state once again that I DO NOT condone or agree with the views expressed by JGT. It&#39;s simply a commentary. They&#39;re horrible people, the only character&#39;s you&#39;re supposed to like is like maybe Jess cause she&#39;s super brainwashed, but idk hate her too. I 100% am not transphobic in any way, I am very supportive of the trans community. I do not agree with how JGT views women AT ALL. I don&#39;t EVER want anyone to think I agree with these horrible views. They&#39;re villains, and meant to be taken as such. I myself am very girly, clearly not in this way, but I tend to like to take things I like and see the opposite end of it. I like to step outside the boundaries, some people don&#39;t. I completely understand that, trust me. Nothing caused this, just my anxiety. I never meant for this to become a GoI, it just happened. I love you all and stay safe out there!**##

Hi! My name is Diana! Nice to meet you! Lovely that you stumbled upon this weird page of mine. 

Object Class: Lesbian. 

This was a part of my old author page that I couldn&#39;t let die with the reformatting. 

I&#39;m female, a struggling, awkward college dropout!  ♡〜٩( ˃́▿˂̀ )۶〜♡

My name is Diana! I&#39;m weird, emotional, sensitive, but I also like to consider myself smart and creative. I like all sorts of tv shows. I mean my taste ranges from Miraculous Ladybug to South Park to Criminal Minds. I’m interested in so many things it’s unreal. My brain never likes to stay in one place, and I guess that’s a good thing for this sort of site. My problem is having ideas but never knowing how to go about them, or how to develop them properly. But I suppose I got some right, huh?

Also I am currently obsessed with the game Identity V, if you like it feel free to hit me up and talk about it! Galatea and Margaretha are best girls! 

I constantly have new ideas. I have lots of my own stories and characters that don’t have to do with SCP. I’ve been creating since I was a kid. It’s my passion, it’s what I want to do in life. Create in some way. I’m real close to entering the real world. --Currently as I will be entering college soon, I plan to study, history, government, and politics! Hoping  once I&#39;m more knowledgeable I can provide y&#39;all with some sick historical stuff. :D-- I&#39;ve dropped out due to health reasons im so cool

If you want me to review your idea, feel free to shoot me a PM! I prefer shorter pieces and ideas!

**My strengths:** Light horror, psychology, real word problems, cute things, horror in weird ways, technology/AIs, history, some humanoids, some animals, wholesome stuff, cute bugs.

**Likes:** Short concept pitches, outside the box ideas, short drafts. 

I will mostly crit concepts, but sometimes I&#39;ll do drafts if I&#39;m in the mood.


**Social Media:**

 Check out [[[https://diana-berry.tumblr.com/|this link for my new tumblr]]].

[[[https://www.reddit.com/u/Berryberrybun/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf|My reddit]]] Small chance the link won&#39;t work. Anyways the name is Berryberrybun

Instagram- Curerosetta. Not quite sure how to link it. Anyways I don&#39;t really post SCP stuff there, it&#39;s just cats. I might post SCP art to my blog Ladyglitterbugs in the future, but idk.

Artbreeder- [[[https://artbreeder.com/dianaberry|DianaBerry]]]

I have other social media, but that&#39;s what I use the most so it&#39;s all I&#39;m linking.

Oh and I&#39;ve got an account on SCP amino. It&#39;s called Ꭰιαηα βεrrγ ♡

I also play many mobile games, my name is generally DianaBerry, DianaBerryBun, BerryBerryBun. something around that. I play Identity V, AFK Arena, Food Fantasy, CocoPPaPlay (my name is PorriBerry on there), Cat Game, Skull Girls, Cencilla, Love Nikki (I&#39;m DianaBunny on there), I think that&#39;s all. 

I did play CocoPPaDolls but THEY SHUT IT DOWN CURSE THEM one day I will publish an SCP expressing my feelings towards that I swear &gt;o&lt;

[[tab If anything happens and yada yada]]
If I disappear for a long time,  or I&#39;m just not on and you need to contact me, [[*user Mew-ltiverse]] is my sibling so just poke them to get me. If anything happens to me, it&#39;s Mew&#39;s responsibility to make sure my drafts see the light of day.
