[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2310 i] dont think i can take it anymore
ive tied down the handlebar
to my closet door

i tucked a note under your porch
so if you want to look for me
youll know what youre in for

i carved out a hole into the wall
i put some cash inside of it
and some stuff that i bought

when i sealed it up
i heard this sort of mumbling
then it just stopped

in 20 years this house will be for sale
ive found funny parts inside
the price should never fail

i was waiting for a new thing
i was building over the old thing
i touched the wet parts
and i touched the blurry parts

why did you pull out my hair?
you snuck something onto my scalp
and now theres nothing there

where did you get my things?
somethings not right officer
i would never tell a thing

i would never tell a soul
how it got so old
i let some mold
grow on the top of it
just for me to hold

i was waiting for a new thing
i was building over the old thing
i touched the wet parts
and i touched the blurry parts

when i wrote my note for you
i thought you would sniff it out
before i mailed it to 

the people living downstairs
they dont like you very much
but you shouldnt care

i will find it out some day
i wish i knew what to say
(except) i will find it out some day

ill take the plaster down from the wall
get my needles out of it
just say Fuck it all

get my needles out of it
just say Fuck it all

i was waiting for a new thing
i was building over the old thing
i touched the wet parts
and i touched the blurry parts

i was waiting for a new thing
i was building over the old thing
i touched the wet parts
and i touched the blurry parts

it was very very mean of me to say
it was very mean of me to say
it was very mean of me to say
it was very mean of me, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7610 too]
