**Item #:** SCP-4754

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Any reports of SCP-4754 are to be investigated and, if found to be valid, the building is to be condemned under the pretense of a municipal health department. Diners and staff found inside the building are to be detained and interviewed if SCP-4754 is active upon discovery. Subjects in need of dental care are to be given a low-cost implant option to maintain normalcy.

**Description:** SCP-4754 is a pop-up restaurant which manifests in vacant or abandoned storefronts. It has only been known to manifest in metropolitan areas with a population of 25,000 or greater. The branding and menu selection varies between different appearances. Cooks, wait staff, and other employees necessary to run a restaurant will be hired through short-term work services. 

SCP-4754 is inhabited by a group of humanoid beings collectively designated as 4754-A. Their physical appearance is hidden by sanitary masks and other dental doctor&#39;s garb with any visible features usually being described as &#34;bird-like.&#34; Speaking with a universally shrill tone of voice, 4754-A also frequently clack and lick their presumed teeth beneath the mask(s).

Approximately one month after SCP-4754&#39;s opening, during peak business hours, 4754-A will emerge from the kitchen with a full suite of dental operating equipment attached to a mobile reclining chair. They will approach a diner with a mouthful of food and, after briefly inspecting their incisor teeth, inject an unknown solution into the subject&#39;s gums to induce a semi-conscious state and full-body numbness.

4754-A will then eat any foreign matter from the subject&#39;s oral cavity starting with any half-eaten food and then proceeding to extracting any of the subject&#39;s teeth containing fillings or which have otherwise received visible and permanent dental care. 

The quantity of 4754-A present for this procedure allows each instance to eat at least one of the subject&#39;s teeth. The method of consumption varies, with some appearing to crunch teeth to powder while other 4754-A may suck on a tooth in a manner similar to a &#34;jawbreaker&#34; candy.

During this process, all present instances of 4754-A will casually communicate with one other, while only speaking at the subject. Remarks such as &#34;I hope you remembered not to floss. I&#39;m a big fan of dessert&#34; and &#34;this molar looks like it&#39;ll be very //filling//.&#34; 4754-A consistently describes dental retainers and braces as being &#34;crunchy.&#34;

Staff and customers are fully capable of observing these events, but have never regarded them as unusual or mentioned them without prompting.

After they finish consuming from the subject&#39;s oral cavity, 4754-A will place them back in their dining chair, then disappear once they and their equipment have crossed the threshold into the kitchen or back room of SCP-4754. 

After closing for that night, SCP-4754 will not re-open again at that location.
