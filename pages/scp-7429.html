[[include component:image-block | name=SCP7429(1) | caption=SCP-7429 pouncing on D-51020, otherwise known as [REDACTED]. This photo was taken in the last moments of the D-Class while pinned to the floor  by the creature. | width=[[WIDTH-GOES-HERE]]

**Item #:** SCP-7429

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7429 is to be kept contained in Special Containment Site 7429-1, a 10m by 10m by 10m containment area with 50m thick walls located inside Site 7429, also known as Mount [REDACTED]. SCP-7429&#39;s past behavior patterns have indicated the entity should be contained in a containment cell painted in pitch-black with a gray floor, isolated at a site minimum 18000km from any other Keter or Euclid containment classes with specially trained personnel of at least Level 4 clearance.

**Description:** SCP-7429 resembles a light gray humanoid entity, lacking material beyond the waist. A hole where a waist might have been has human-like innards dangling from inside. Its torso is little more than twice the height of an average human male torso, measured approximately at 40 inches by D-51020. The D-Class also measured that the entity&#39;s wingspan takes up about 3/4 of the length of its containment cell. The entity is said to &#34;lag&#34; at random interval. This &#34;lagging&#34; is described as the entity staying completely frozen in place, moving slightly, and then going back to normal movement. When moving &#34;normally&#34;, the entity moves by pushing its arms off the ground, then its torso. If SCP-7429 sees any sentient being within a 95-meter radius, it will immediately attack its victim, traveling at unnerving speeds without lag. Entity likely has been posessed by SCP-035, explaining the black liquid dripping out of its radio-static eyes and mouth.

D-51020 was eliminated by the entity during above photograph. The following addendum is a conversation between Dr. William [REDACTED] and SCP-7429.

&gt; **Addendum 7429-1, extended**
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7429:** {{I know who you are. Do not attempt any more stunts, otherwise bad things will happen.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. William [REDACTED]:** Well, that&#39;s one way to say hello.
&gt; 
&gt; //*Silence*//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. William:** So, who are you then?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7429:** {{Me? Well, I am the great Lagger, known all across Mount [REDACTED]. This was my home, and now you have transformed it into a horrible, metal cage.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. William:** Do you know anything about a foundation that collects anomalies?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7429:** {{What a stupid question. Did I not already say I know exactly who you are? In fact, I know you were planning on asking this, but yes, I have been posessed by 035. He&#39;s never truly left me.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. William:** What- H-How did you-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7429: {{Enough jabber. Goodbye, and good riddance.}}
&gt; 
&gt; //Brief sound of speaker glitching, connection terminates//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. William:** We need to conduct further research on this entity. How did it read my mind like a book? Maybe it will even get its own file if I convince the higher-ups of the danger of this thing.

**Addendum 7429-2**
SCP-7429 is documented to be extremely intelligent, sometimes threatening to breach containment. 

**Addendum 7429-3**
Anomaly reclassified to Keter, after Incident 7429-1, per Order 105x-7429-3.
