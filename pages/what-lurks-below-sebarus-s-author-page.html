As I was saying, welcome, traveler. Haven&#39;t seen a lot of souls ever since they locked me down here. Why not stay a while, and listen to an old thing ramble? You don&#39;t look like you&#39;re in a hurry either, not with that leg of yours. Be careful around the edge, so you don&#39;t fall in here. It&#39;s a long way down.

Oh, why am I down here, you ask. I&#39;m here because many choose to fear that which they don&#39;t understand, and many choose to destroy, or in my case lock away, what they fear. I have been here for a long time, so long that most souls in this facility have forgotten that I&#39;m even here. I have had a lot of free time. Want to know what I do with that free time?

I write. With will as my quill and the fabric of reality as my canvas, I write, and my words shape reality.

[[module ListUsers users=&#34;.&#34;]]
Who&#39;s to say I&#39;m not writing about you right now, %%title%%? Are the movements of your eyes, scanning the screen in front of you, merely dictations of mine?

What? Sorry, I was just talking to another friend of mine. Do you want to see what other lives my words have molded?

&#34;//The main anomaly of SCP-4823 is a localized trans-dimensional two-way gateway in place of fruit flesh. The gateway becomes exposed when the banana is peeled, which can only be done halfway. Upon exposure, the gateway will draw the peeler in, exposing them to a noodle effect caused by a strong non-homogenous gravitational field, in order for them to fit through.//&#34;

This was my first skip, and it has exceeded all my wildest dreams. A bit of context: while I only became a member of the site in 2018 and active in the community in 2019, I have been an active lurker here since 2012-2013. I enjoyed reading the site, but the community always seemed distant to me somehow. The fact that I&#39;m now part of it feels... weird, and the fact that I have produced content for it even weirder. When I made this, I was proud of just getting something on the site. I expected this to reach maybe +20, and I would have been happy with that. But, against all of my expectations, it got into the Reviewer&#39;s Spotlight (thank you [[*user Kilonova]]) and the rating just soared. After that, people have made fan art and audio adaptations and translations of it, it&#39;s appeared (briefly) in a Markiplier video and it&#39;s just... mind blowing to me. On the September of 2020 it also became the first article on the site to have ever been both Reviewer&#39;s spotlighted //and// featured (thank you [[*user OCuin]], [[*user Flopmind]] and [[*user REDESERT]]), which is even more insane. 

Oh, a few fun facts: This was actually inspired by a dumb JoJo meme posted in the WL Discord by [[*user Rounderhouse]], and every character in this skip is actually named after different banana varieties.

This was my [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/exquisite-corpse-contest |CorpseCon]]] entry, and thus a collab with [[*user stop1010]]. Making it was a bit of a struggle, and went through a lot of research, brainstorming, critique, editing, trimming, etc. At the end of the day though, I&#39;m pretty happy with how it turned out. 

This is basically a critique on the ecological impact of capitalism and its unsustainability, based on an actual culinary trend which lead to the decimation of the snapping turtle population in real life. It was an interesting topic to research and write about, and I&#39;m glad this project made me do that.

This was my first real attempt at horror, and it kind of shows. Like with 5063, I tried going for something reminiscent of Series 1 tropes, in this case a murder monster instead of a thing that does a thing, but with a modern twist. Unlike 5063 however, it didn&#39;t do very well. It&#39;s fine though, I&#39;m happy enough with it, and while being my lowest rated work at the time of writing, it&#39;s been steadily going up and it&#39;s not gonna fall into deletion anytime soon. Hopefully. 

5137 is also a good example of inspiration coming from the weirdest of places. I have a bad habit of picking on the skin of my fingers, and the thought of &#34;what if you made a construct out of skin&#34; hit me while I was doing that. I have no idea where the friendship aspect of it came from.

This was my entry for the CupidCon, and it&#39;s kind of different from the type of stuff I normally write. It still retains the same level of absurdism, but it&#39;s absurd comedy instead of the usual tragedy. Originally, I wanted to write like, proper romance for the contest because that&#39;s not something I&#39;ve written before, but I couldn&#39;t come up with any exciting ideas and I was really unmotivated by the contest. Then I came up with this ridiculous idea, and pitched it to a few friends in voicechat, whose disgusted reactions assured me that I had to write it. 

It was originally supposed to be kind of a parody on those weird dating simulators where you&#39;re romancing a lama prince or some shit, but then it evolved into... something else. I&#39;m actually pretty proud of how it turned out. 

Few fun facts: Dr. Ducrotay is named after Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville, the dude who found and taxonomized sea cucumbers. He did that in 1834, which is why the designation for the article is 5834. 

On the topic of fun facts, if this commentary hasn&#39;t convinced you read the article, I&#39;ll let you know that I read a lot about sea cucumbers and found out a lot of weird and fun facts about them, that I&#39;ve sprinkled throughout the article. So if you fee like learning about these weird animals... you get the hint.

This was originally a Bright challenge, but I wasn&#39;t happy with the first iteration of it so I deleted it, rewrote it and then reposted it, even though it probably would have survived. I didn&#39;t get any critique for the rewrite either, other than the comments on the first post, but I don&#39;t know if that disqualifies this as a successful Bright challenge.

CotBG saw a shift from always being the bad guys to being more neutral a long time ago, I feel like sarkicists are still mostly seen as the villains, which I&#39;m not a fan of. There&#39;s been a few articles about good proto-sarkics, but I don&#39;t remember seeing any about neo-sarkics. So, as I&#39;ve regardless always liked sarkicism, I decided that I would try to write a story about the average life of average practitioners of Nälkä. No cults, no crazy blood rituals, no nefarious secret agenda. Just a normal family with a normal life, who just happen to practice carnomancy and have flesh beast as a pet.

The first tale in Spectrum, the tale series that my team, consisting of myself, [[*user BrokenOrdinance]] and [[*user UncertaintyCrossing]], wrote for the Canon Renaissance Contest. It&#39;s set in the later stages of the Rat&#39;s Nest canon, so everything is weird and reality is fucked up. It tells the tale of Mirage, an angy, delusional bird-man surviving in the apocalypse and embarking on a journey to paint the greatest painting the world has ever seen.

Third tale for the series that me, UncertaintyCrossing and BrokenOrdinance wrote for CanRenCon. This one was a collaboration between myself and Crossing, with me writing the first half and him the latter. We studied Adelanto and its history and tried to include as much as we could about it in the tale. Even the hot irons are there because the founder of the town was the inventor of them. I also just thought that the image of flying hot irons chasing people is cool.

This was my first real attempt at writing stream of consciousness. It wasn&#39;t received super well, which is understandable, it&#39;s a bit weird and out of my comfort zone, but I&#39;m proud of it. I think there&#39;s some pretty good lines there.  It also relates to The Pillars, which is a Freeport I&#39;m establishing.

This was kind of a last minute post for the last theme in JamCon 2020, &#34;More Than Meets The Eye&#34;. Wrote it in about 2 hours, and had enough time to get crit from one person, but out of my JamCon posts I&#39;m the proudest of this one.

&#34;//You see, Clara is very fun-sized for a capybara. She&#39;s barely bigger than my fist! Her pups, all of whom seem to be asexually produced clones of herself, are merely the size of a thumb. Unfortunately, they don&#39;t grow any bigger than that, as they always die just a few weeks after birth from complications that we can&#39;t figure out the reason for.//&#34;

This was the first thing I posted after 4 months of writer&#39;s block. It was originally supposed to be a cute and sweet story about tiny capybaras, but somehow it ended up being one of the darkest things I&#39;ve ever written. Somehow. I&#39;m happy with how it came out though.

A collab with [[*user UncertaintyCrossing]]. It is our first, long awaited (by me) Parawatch article! And I&#39;ve put it in the GoI tab on my author page because I do not agree with the categorization of Parawatch articles as tales, and this is my author page where I can do whatever the hell I want. 

This is based on an urban legend and inspired by a short story by Patricia C. McKissack. The idea was Crossings, and he wrote the first half, while I wrote the second.

This is the page you&#39;re looking at right now, how trippy is that? It feels really surreal to finally have one on the site. Anyway, I decided to write the flavor text for this from the perspective of a skip, because why not. It&#39;s a little cringy, I admit, but who cares, it&#39;s just an author page.

This is a space to showcase all of the cool things that people have made out of my stuff! I appreciate all of it, and I am greatly honored that people think that my writings are worthy of making more stuff out of, so it deserves to be showcased. If you have made something and it isn&#39;t here, it probably just means that I haven&#39;t seen it. In that case, if you want it up here, feel free to DM me on either Wikidot or Discord if we share a server.
