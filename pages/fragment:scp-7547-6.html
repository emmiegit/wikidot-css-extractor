The ocean battered and beat at Pinocchio, powerless against the all-mighty strength of the sea. His hands slapped at the watery surface, trying desperately to find solid purchase to no avail. Where did Geppeto go? Where was Jiminy Cricket? Pinocchio felt abandoned, but he didn’t want to believe that; being abandoned felt much scarier than being lost at sea. As if in response to his thoughts, the waves rose the little puppet up into the air before slamming him back down with a loud //SPLASH//!

The waves did this again and again, furious with Pinocchio’s hint of bravery. Just when the little puppet thought this was the end, something great and terrible burst from the water. It was Monstro the whale! The beast jumped into the air before slamming down with an even bigger //SPLASH//! Now Pinocchio remembered: he couldn’t find anyone because Monstro had eaten everything. The school, Jiminy, his father, all of them were gobbled up by Monstro. He was sad, because now he couldn’t talk to any of them ever again. He didn’t want to be gobbled up too. Pinocchio kicked his little feet to flee, but the stormy sea overpowered him.

Monstro turned to the little puppet, opening its gargantuan maw. It made Pinocchio think of a dark pit when he saw it, a big dark bottomless pit. The waves twisted and turned, throwing Pinocchio like a ragdoll as the water flowed into the whale’s mouth. The little puppet fought against the current, swimming away desperately as he was dragged into Monstro. Pinocchio wished his father was here to protect him, or Jiminy Cricket to tell him everything would be alright. He reached for the sky, the light, the Great Fairy, anything that would save him.

And then Monstro swallowed him whole, never to come out again.
