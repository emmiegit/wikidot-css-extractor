Ohshitohshitohshit//ohshit//.

My name&#39;s Jeremy Adams and I&#39;m 22 and I&#39;m being chased by a monster. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. I don&#39;t know how this is possible, or what I&#39;m supposed to do. The thing won&#39;t stop. I&#39;ve been running for — oh god — only fifteen minutes. Feels like longer. I&#39;m exhausted and it won&#39;t stop.

I didn&#39;t do anything wrong. I just saw this guy on the subway. It&#39;s night, we were the only people in the car. He looked odd, a bit gray and glassy-eyed, which was odd because from his hands I&#39;d have guessed he was black or Indian or something. We got off at the same stop and I guess I wasn&#39;t looking where I was going because I bumped into him and his head fell off. I mean, that doesn&#39;t happen. And then he got up and chased after me. That... that... //can&#39;t// happen.

How is it even following me anyhow? It&#39;s not like it has eyes. Another door locked. No! Can&#39;t someone have left their door unlocked tonight? Please, I just need to get away from this thing and there it is how did it get behind me? shitshitTrashcan! I grab one and swing it straight into the thing&#39;s chest and it stumbles backwards and collapses and I&#39;m off running before it can get back up. Thank you adrenaline.

How can this alley be a dead end? It can&#39;t be, I need to escape! It&#39;s not fair! Walls, walls, damn it. Too high and too slick and it&#39;s found me. Anything around? No. I can&#39;t fight, but I try to punch it and it&#39;s strong and this doesn&#39;t make any sense and is that a blade and

~

Much, much better. Could hardly even hear with that old one by the end. But this one is good. Young, healthy, should last me for weeks. Colorblind, but you can&#39;t have everything. And let&#39;s see... Reasonably bright, too. I just hope I didn&#39;t get too far off track getting this one. Mr. Redd, I&#39;m coming for you. And I can&#39;t wait to find out what wonderful thoughts I can think with that head of yours.
