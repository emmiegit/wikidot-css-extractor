I don&#39;t have an office. 

In the time I&#39;ve been at Site-19, I&#39;ve done maybe one or two things that could be considered actual work. Ever since a filing mistake assigned me to a non-existent &#34;Department of Unreality,&#34; I&#39;ve had nothing to do. 

I most certainly don&#39;t recognize the door in front of me, whose plaque very clearly reads:

[[=]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
Alex Thorley

Reality Liaison
 Dept. of Unreality
[[/div]]

[[/=]]

I think about what to do with the sudden appearance of an office with my name. This has happened before. I think back to [[[your-imaginary-friend | the dossier incident.]]] It doesn&#39;t make sense. The department isn&#39;t real, and it&#39;s whole thing is researching things that aren&#39;t real, but why do things keep appearing? Why me? 

It&#39;s been two months since I started my search into the confusing mess that is the Department of Unreality, and the only lead I have is the name of the director: John Doe. I say lead, but that&#39;s awfully optimistic of me. It&#39;s a placeholder name at best. 

And now, an office. An office that reads &#34;reality liaison,&#34; my supposed position within this department that doesn&#39;t exist. But what does reality liaison––

I&#39;m struck by a memory. The dossier. The dossier whose list of department members named John Doe  the director also identified me as the reality liaison for the department. The pieces fall in place. I know what I have to do. I grab the door, and enter the office. 

[[include component:image-block name=Unrealityoffice|caption= My office.|width=100%|align=center]]

The room is barren, save for a couple of paperweights and a desk with my name on it. A simple plaque reading Alex Thorley serves as the only decor, with a couple of folders neatly organized in a drawer next to a penholder. Out of instinct or habit, I flick through the folders. I find them organized alphabetically, with tabs indicating the urgency of the task they summarize. Just as I like it. I flick to the files marked with a red line, the sign I use to identify the most urgent things I have to do. I pull a yellow folder out, and close the drawer. Inside it is a singular form, already filled out for me. A transfer request from Site-19 to Site-184, authorized by one John Doe, director. 

My head starts spinning as the room seems to get smaller. //This is it. This proves something is going on for real.// I start thinking of what to do next. I could get out and seek out a site director, a project lead, or whomever. This room never existed before, that&#39;s got to be something, right? This is proof that I&#39;m not just unlucky, but that something //is// happening.

Suddenly, I feel the entire world stop making sense.

I&#39;m back in the room. Some time has passed. Thinking hurts, but I start feeling like myself again. That was weird. I must have lost my balance for a moment or something. I stand up from my desk, and I head towards the exit. I open the door to a small contingent of guards and wide-eyed researchers that immediately descend on me and power on a small portable device emitting a blue light, which I recognize as a portable reality anchor. Suddenly, the room blinks out of existence, and I&#39;m left staring dumbfounded at the guards as they immediately tell me to stay where I am and start talking amongst themselves. After a brief deliberation, they ask me to follow them. I look out the nearest window as I&#39;m taken to a containment cell, and I see waves as far as the eye can see. 

I think I fucked up.

Several hours later, my identity is verified, and a different set of questions related to the room I came from starts setting in. The site I&#39;ve materialized into is Site-184, in //Canada//. I explain everything to the best of my ability, but there really is nothing more than what I&#39;ve observed so far. As I&#39;m told, a number of similar rooms started appearing throughout almost all major Foundation sites overnight, and that the phenomenon is already [[[SCP-6208 | being investigated]]].

When I&#39;m finally let go, I&#39;m given a small room on-site, and a very thinly veiled order not to leave the site at all under any circumstances until they gather more information on what happened to me. I look at the small digital clock on the nightstand: Six o&#39;clock. So much for sleep. I decide to take in the sights of wherever I ended up. The nearest map of the facility gives me a pretty clear view of what&#39;s going on pretty fast. A dock, some sort of art and artifacts building, and a couple facilities dedicated to aquatic anomalies. The focus on the ocean is pretty obvious, and so I set out to see the sea for myself and head to the docks. As I make my way there, I fail to notice the people who are very clearly already there until it&#39;s too late. Someone notices me.

//Hey, you here for the [[[the-fishing-council | Fishing Council]]] meeting?//

The voice comes from a woman in the crowd of half a dozen people, all holding an assortment of fishing equipment. She gestures at me to come closer, and as I approach I notice that her equipment is noticeably newer than that of the rest of the gathered individuals. Among the crowd I sense the stare of a few guards who I recognize from my welcome party, although their interest seems to fall mostly on their gear. I arrive at the congregation, and introduce myself to the woman who noticed me. 

//Hey. Uh, I don&#39;t know what the fishing council is, but I&#39;m guessing it has to do with fishing?//

The woman looks at me funny. Which, fair enough, I guess.

//An astute observation. First time visiting one eighty-four? My name&#39;s Emma.//

Emma stretches out their hand, and after a short pause I shake it. I guess I //am// technically at Site-184 for the first time. Even if by accident.

//Yeah, you could say it&#39;s my first time &#34;visiting&#34;. The name&#39;s Alex.//

I do air quotes at the word visiting, which catches Emma&#39;s attention.

//Oh, are you the person that came in through that extra room we had for a while? Some of the guys mentioned it briefly.//

Great.

//Yup, that&#39;s me. Still don&#39;t know what that was about, to be honest.//

She pauses for a moment, mulling something over.

//Hey, why don&#39;t you come with us for a bit? We can get you a fishing rod; we have a bunch of spare ones ever since we started inviting people on these fishing trips.//

//I&#39;m kinda on site arrest right now, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m allowed out on a boat.//

Emma turns towards the crowd, and makes a series of gestures at a man standing near one of the fishing boats. I can&#39;t quite understand what she&#39;s miming, but she points at me and at the boats, and the man responds with a thumbs up. Emma turns back to me.

//Alright, I just asked security, and it looks like you&#39;re all set if you wanna join in.//

I think about my options for a bit.

//Sure, why not?//

The sea is nice. I haven&#39;t really been at sea before, but the quasi-hypnotic lull of the waves tranquilizes me plenty. I make idle conversation with Emma on Site-19, how I got here, and the lingering concerns I have of having been transported across an entire country almost seamlessly. She talks about her work on the Department of Anomalous Art and Artifacts, and I crack an attempt at a joke about my own department. 

The boat glides over the waves at a steady pace, and soon we find ourselves drifting silently in a quiet spot, surrounded by sea on all directions. The anchor drops, and without so much as a sound, everyone casts out their fishing lines. 

The next couple of hours are a blur in the sense that there&#39;s not much to note. There&#39;s an air of tranquility throughout the scene, and it is in moments like these where I get to thinking outside the noise of regular life. I&#39;ve had too many close calls in too little time. I&#39;m new to the Foundation, and I&#39;ve done nothing but squander my time because I&#39;ve been able to? That doesn&#39;t seem right to me. I don&#39;t want to coast by doing nothing and passing it off as work. And yet, I&#39;m plagued by these small moments involving the same themes, over and over again. Something happens, and I barely blink at the situation until it&#39;s far past me. I make a decision right there and then. I&#39;m gonna find out what&#39;s going on. No more half-assing it.

//Hey, you alright? We&#39;re going, so maybe reel in your line before we leave.//

Emma has been looking at me for some time. By this point I&#39;m the last person left fishing, and I quickly begin to reel my line in. It feels tense, and for a moment, I think something&#39;s hooked onto it, but the line comes out of the water empty. Emma gives me a sympathetic look.

//Don&#39;t worry, there&#39;s not many fish out here this time of year.//

We leave our fishing spot, and head towards Site-184.

Back at the site, I find a couple of people waiting for me. They explain that a new room has appeared inside Site-184 and ask for my help in going through it again as soon as some basic testing inside has been conducted. I agree. The woman who explains all this to me introduces herself as Jennifer Williams, of the Department of Memetics. I choose not to question why Memetics is looking into a spatial anomaly, and answer as many questions as I can. Towards the end of my conversation with her, I ask for specifics on the room, given that I won&#39;t be entering it anytime soon. Williams describes a plain office, similar to what I remember of the one I&#39;d been to, but towards the end, she makes an observation.

She notes a desk with an empty fish tank, decorated as though it contains a fish.

I smile at that. It&#39;s a solid catch.</textarea></pre>
