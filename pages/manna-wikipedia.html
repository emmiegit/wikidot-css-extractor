The **Manna Charitable Foundation**  is a [# non-profit organization] dedicated to providing emergency relief and humanitarian aid to underdeveloped areas around the world. It is nonsectarian[[span class=&#34;ct&#34;]]^^[# citation needed]^^[[/span]] and non-governmental, being the largest international paranormal charity. In 2030, it reported having helped over 5 billion people cumulatively in over 130 countries and sovereign states, including formerly //sub rosa// enclaves such as [[[three-portlands-hub|Three Portlands]]][[footnote]][[[three-portlands-hub|3portlands.com]]]. Retrieved 2026-08-19.[[/footnote]] and [[[esterberg-city-wikipedia|Esterberg]]].[[footnote]] [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/esterberg-city-wikipedia#toc11 esterberg.com.pl]. Retrieved 2023-03-11.[[/footnote]]

Due to the anomalous and anomaly-adjacent nature of its operations, much about the Manna Charitable Foundation was relatively unknown until after [[[scp-6500|the publicization of the Impasse event]]] and the dissolution of the [# SCP Foundation].

The Manna Charitable Foundation has received praises for its initiatives in improving living conditions globally, although allegations regarding mishandling of anomalous assets have been levied against the MCF, and its actions are oftentimes panned by the anomalous world.

+ History

[[span class=&#34;s-title&#34;]]Background[[/span]]

The Manna Charitable Foundation&#39;s precursor did not keep exact records of its founding or activities prior to the 2nd millennium BCE — most details were orally preserved, and are often mixtures of facts and legends.

Originating in the [# Central Africa] region (possibly ancient [# Chad]), the Manna Charitable Foundation&#39;s precursor was a small, self-sustaining rural community, often taking in the homeless, displaced refugees and other marginalized or outcast groups of people.[[span class=&#34;ct&#34;]]^^[# citation needed]^^[[/span]] This community followed a partly nomadic way of life, not settling in one place for too extended a period of time.

Despite this, it was able to consistently produce sufficient amount of food and supplies using poorly understood, likely anomalous, horticultural practices.[[footnote]][https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/abridged-retirement-proposals#toc5 scp.declass]. Retrieved 2022-12-10.[[/footnote]] They did not act as a single, monolithic group, but instead gradually broke off into many sub-divisions that act largely independent of one another, in many areas at once.

Some time around 3000 BCE, these subdivisions regrouped into a single organization, apparently by a single figure by the epithet &#34;Manna&#34;. There are few surviving records of this figure, excepting local myths and folklores which often refer to &#34;the Charitable&#34; and &#34;the benefactor&#34; (although some also refer to Manna as an object or concept).[[footnote]][[[manna|wanderers-resource.sp]]]. Retrieved 2022-12-10.[[/footnote]] In many of these stories, the passing of Manna is what galvanized the creation of a unified humanitarian service.

Officially, the name &#34;Manna Charitable Foundation&#34; did not appear in any written records until its European branch came into contact with the [[[goc-hub-page|United Nations Global Occult Coalition]]] in 1947.

[[span class=&#34;s-title&#34;]]1947-2000[[/span]]

The Manna Charitable Foundation operated primarily in Africa, Europe and Asia until the late 80s. In 1947, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India Partition of India] caused the MCF&#39;s Asian branch to focus its crisis relief efforts around the newly formed Pakistan. The Mission Work Groups there later reorganized into the South Asian branch in 1948, with the former Asian branch becoming the East Asian branch.

In 1997, the Manna Charitable became one of only four non-South-East-Asian signatories of the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-096-vn ASEAN Paracultural Accord], others being the SCP Foundation, the [[[horizon-initiative-hub|Horizon Initiative]]] and the [http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/toyoho-hub Tono Yokai Sanctuary]. This allowed them greater movement within the region, eventually also extending their operations to Oceanian territories.

[[span class=&#34;s-title&#34;]]2001-2020[[/span]]

Following the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Afghanistan US invasion of Afghanistan], the Manna Charitable Foundation&#39;s South Asian branch provided extensive humanitarian aid to Afghan refugees in Pakistan. Several Mission Work Groups were sent to Afghanistan, but they were often intercepted by the SCP Foundation, the [[[oria-hub|Office For The Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts]]] and the occupying US military force.

The MCF ultimately withdrew from the country in January 2003, after the deaths of many of its workers from erroneous Coalition bombing.[[span class=&#34;ct&#34;]]^^[# citation needed]^^[[/span]] 

[[[dr-wondertainment-hub|Doctor Wondertainment]]], having made multiple donations in the past, became an official affiliated partner for the Manna Charitable Foundation in March 2009.[[footnote]][[[scp-445|Wondertainment Besties Forever]]]. //wondertainment.com//.

Retrieved 2021-11-10[[/footnote]]

[[span class=&#34;s-title&#34;]]2021-[[/span]]

The Manna Charitable Foundation went public on November 1st, 2021. In addition, it opened volunteer and worker application portal on its website. In August 2022, the MCF launched an ambassadorship program in collaboration with the United Nations.

[[span class=&#34;s-title&#34;]]Areas of activity[[/span]]

The Manna Charitable Foundation and its precursor have historically been known to be active outside Africa in South Asia and Europe since at least the 1800s, although there are evidence they were active in the Americas since as early as the 900s,[[span class=&#34;ct&#34;]]^^[# citation needed]^^[[/span]] and Hy-Brasil around the 1300s.[[footnote]][[[nx-03|GOC Report on Unusual Locations]]]. //ungoc.org//.[[/footnote]]

[[span class=&#34;s-title&#34;]]Finances and assets[[/span]]

The Manna Charitable Foundation receives funding primarily from donors and fundraising efforts. The MCF possesses many anomalous objects and materials (many of //[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/ectoentropic ex nihilo]// quality) to assist in humanitarian efforts. These are typically donated to the MCF from organizations and presences of the anomalous world, such as Doctor Wondertainment, UNGOC, [[[dado-hub|dado]]] and Vanguard.

[[span class=&#34;s-title&#34;]]Relationship with Vanguard[[/span]]

The Manna Charitable Foundation declined an offer from Vanguard to be one of its board members, citing bureaucratic efficiency issues, and that it currently only seeks partnership from a select few.[[footnote]][[[scp-7292|Vanguard Newsletters]]]. //vanguard.org//. [[/footnote]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
Manna is grateful for both your invitation, and the changing of your way to stop the death of magic.

The charitable spirit appreciates and accepts one&#39;s desire to help - but empathy finds kinship only in wonder and kindness.

— Rhiannon Locke

Nevertheless, Vanguard remains one of the Manna Charitable Foundation&#39;s more prominent donors.

Following the fall of the Veil, many of the Manna Charitable Foundation’s actions came into public view. Although lauded for both their pre-Veil and post-Veil humanitarian efforts, they have also been criticized for reckless endangerment of volunteers, mishandling of anomalous objects, lack of vetting of benefactors, user-unfriendly registration process, and outdated website.

The Manna Charitable Foundation came under fire for alleged involvement with the massacre of Vila Meã, Tâmega in Portugal,  which resulted in the death of 32 people. At the time, the MCF was active in a nearby region, who then  withdrew from Portugal shortly after, citing logistics issues. This led to accusations of criminal negligence from detractors, who criticized them for avoiding responsibilities.

In actuality, the Manna Charitable Foundation withdrew from the region due to asset dispute with the [https://scp-pt-br.wikidot.com/ Lusophone branch of the SCP Foundation] over contractual agreements made between MCF and the pre-merger [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/grupos-de-interesse#toc3 Academia].

[[[no-return-hub|Vanguard]]] later came forward with several declassified documents detailing the actual incident, disproving any notions of the MCF&#39;s involvement in the massacre. However, it was also revealed that their in-house-bred //[[[scp-514|columba livia domestica]]]// flock escaped holding during the withdrawal, leading to record-low crime rates and a moderate increase in pigeon droppings incidents over a two-year period of 2014-2016.

In January 2022, it was discovered in its financial records that the Manna Charitable Foundation has received multiple donations from the Red Rebels. The MCF denies any direct connections, stating that the Red Rebels do not have any influence on any of the foundation&#39;s activities or proceeds. The MCF&#39;s International Board expressed &#34;Manna does not discriminate from whence the goodness of one&#39;s heart originates.&#34; 

In the following weeks, multiple cases of strange activities were reported from both the MCF and the Red Rebels, such as campaigning for the reunification of Ireland[[footnote]][[[kompas-parapolityczny-na-trudne-czasy|Aviatica News]]]. //aviatica.info//.

United States government et al. vs Manna Charitable Foundation
[[/div]]

The governments of the United States, Canada, Thailand, Australia, among others filed a lawsuit against the Manna Charitable Foundation for charity fraud on September 19, 2023. While no charges were pressed regarding unregulated cross-border movements and transport of anomalous materials (per the [# Treaty of Paris on pre-Veil Secrecy],[[footnote]][[[dr-dan-goes-to-washington|bbc.co.uk]]]. Retrieved 2021-12-21 [[/footnote]]) the MCF had operated as a non-anomalous charity under multiple fronts as part of their undercover procedure. This, therefore, would subject them to ordinary laws and regulations not covered by the treaty.

On the day of trial hearing, the Manna Charitable Foundation&#39;s non-Veil-related actions were found to be perfectly legal, by means of a hitherto unidentified [[[SCP-4703|bureaucratohazard]]], after which the lawsuit was suspended, pending future investigation.[[footnote]] [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/kindness vanguard.org]. Retrieved 2023-10-01. [[/footnote]] As the process of appeal and bureaucratomancy were deemed prohibitively lengthy (approximately 1.6x10^^82^^ years), the case was ultimately settled out of court for 37$.
