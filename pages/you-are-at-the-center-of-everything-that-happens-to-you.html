Researcher Talloran lies on a psychiatrist&#39;s couch and a stares at the ceiling.  He sighs in boredom.

SCP-3999 is --pretty bored too, honestly.--

**[SYSTEM ERROR: DATA CORRUPTED. PLEASE SEE A NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR FOR MORE DETAILS]**, it asks.

&#34;Well, it&#39;s just...you ever hear of the infinite monkey theorem?&#34;

**[SYSTEM ERROR: DATA CORRUPTED. PLEASE SEE A NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR FOR MORE DETAILS]**

&#34;Okay, so, basically, if you take an immortal monkey and you sit it down in front of a typewriter and have this immortal monkey just randomly press buttons forever, then eventually it&#39;s going to type out the complete works of Shakespeare, or my social security number, or a 6000-article horror fiction website by complete random chance, because there&#39;s only so many different ways to arrange the characters, you know?&#34;

**[SYSTEM ERROR: DATA CORRUPTED. PLEASE SEE A NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR FOR MORE DETAILS]**

&#34;So you see where I&#39;m going with this, then.  There&#39;s only so many different ways you can torture me, only so many different ways I can die, because there&#39;s only so many different ways to arrange all the atoms left in the multiverse.

&#34;Granted, that&#39;s still a lot.  You might be an idiot but you&#39;ve got a very vivid imagination, I&#39;ll give you that.  But the thing is, is you don&#39;t actually get to try each individual one, since a lot of them are very similar, and even if they aren&#39;t each try still raises my tolerance for pain and horror and bullshit just a little more, right?  So eventually it&#39;ll stop working, and all this crap just won&#39;t be scary or interesting anymore.  It&#39;s been what, a trillion years?&#34;

SCP-3999 checks its watch.  **[SYSTEM ERROR: DATA CORRUPTED. PLEASE SEE A NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR FOR MORE DETAILS]**, it replies.

&#34;Ah, whatever.  Time is dead.  My point is, my point is, I&#39;m not scared of you anymore.  I&#39;m just bored, and honestly a little disappointed.  And I can tell that you are too.&#34;

**[SYSTEM ERROR: DATA CORRUPTED. PLEASE SEE A NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR FOR MORE DETAILS]**

&#34;Well it&#39;s not my fault that you have exactly one pastime.  Take up knitting or something, sheesh.&#34;

**[SYSTEM ERROR: DATA CORRUPTED. PLEASE SEE A NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR FOR MORE DETAILS]**

&#34;Don&#39;t give me that.  You know as well as I do how this ends, or rather, that it doesn&#39;t.  You can go on for however much longer you want but eventually we&#39;re gonna get to a point where I don&#39;t even notice anymore, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be any fun for you if I&#39;m not paying attention.&#34;

**[SYSTEM ERROR: DATA CORRUPTED. PLEASE SEE A NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR FOR MORE DETAILS]**

&#34;No, I&#39;m not.  If I was gonna give up, that would&#39;ve happened a long, //long// time ago.  This shit just isn&#39;t scary anymore.  I guess it was funny for a while after that, but that&#39;s worn off, too.  You&#39;ve thrown everything you had at me, and it didn&#39;t work.  Get over it.&#34;

**[SYSTEM ERROR: DATA CORRUPTED. PLEASE SEE A NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR FOR MORE DETAILS]**

&#34;That&#39;s sad.  It&#39;s fucking pathetic.&#34;

**[SYSTEM ERROR: DATA CORRUPTED. PLEASE SEE A NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR FOR MORE DETAILS]**

&#34;Okay, look.  Look.  Here&#39;s the thing.  Your sole purpose in life is to make me suffer, right?  Why?  What&#39;s so damn rewarding about torturing me?  Well, I have a theory.  That&#39;s the thing, Thirty-Nine Ninety-Nine - can I call you Nines?  I&#39;m calling you Nines.  That&#39;s the thing, Nines.  You give somebody elevendy billion years to suffer, and that&#39;s elevendy billion years to think.  In between all the melting, I&#39;ve been thinking very hard about you.  Why you&#39;re doing this.  What you really //are//.  Because something I always wondered about was, why //me//?  Once those reality anchors gave out you could&#39;ve done this to anyone, to everyone.  But you picked me, Researcher Fucking Talloran.  It&#39;s not just because I went into your chamber first, because even then you&#39;d have eventually moved on to somebody else.  But we&#39;re still here, bored out of our respective minds.  Well, maybe not out of our minds, I think I lost mine somewhere.  Did you ever have one, Nines?&#34;

**[SYSTEM ERROR: DATA CORRUPTED. PLEASE SEE A NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR FOR MORE DETAILS]**

&#34;Don&#39;t look at me like that.&#34;

**[SYSTEM ERROR: DATA CORRUPTED. PLEASE SEE A NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR FOR MORE DETAILS]**

&#34;Anyway, as I was saying, this all feels very personal.  Why are you so fixated on making me suffer?  What are you trying to accomplish?  Wait, hold on, let me get the document...&#34;

Talloran reaches into his pocket and retrieves his cell phone.  A fractal-patterned memetic kill agent appears on his lock screen, but Talloran ignores it.  He opens [[[SCP-3999]]] and reads over it, looking for a specific passage.

&#34;Damn,&#34; he says, &#34;I should really edit this thing down a bit.&#34;  He continues scrolling, quietly humming his favorite Beatles song backwards.

SCP-3999 waits patiently.  It doodles a heart on its notepad.  The heart has tentacles and a scorpion tail.

&#34;Ah, here we go,&#34; Talloran says.  &#34;Found it.  &#39;Researcher Talloran --will-- must submit to his own insecurities.&#39;  Why?  Why are you so fixated on this?

&#34;So, while I was thinking about that, I started to wonder - who //else// hates me this much?  My parents are disappointed in me, yeah, but they don&#39;t want me to suffer existentially for eternity.  Nobody would put me through this kind of torment.

&#34;Except me.  That&#39;s what you are, I think.  Me.  &#39;SCP-3999 is --Researcher Talloran&#39;s soul--&#39;, right?  You are the metaphysical representation of my self-hatred.&#34;

**[SYSTEM ERROR: DATA CORRUPTED. PLEASE SEE A NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR FOR MORE DETAILS]**

&#34;Well, it&#39;s what you are now.  That&#39;s what you made yourself, when you latched on to me.  Here&#39;s the thing, though.  If you&#39;re my self-hatred, and you hate me, then aren&#39;t you really hating yourself?  Since, ultimately, my self-hatred is //part// of me, and that would make you just an externalized portion of my own consciousness, my own tendency to hate myself.

&#34;So, really, you are me.  And I am you.  Which means that, by torturing me, you&#39;ve actually been torturing yourself.  Or I&#39;ve been torturing myself, I guess, though that&#39;s nothing new.  I&#39;ve been howling all my fucking life, kid.  But the best way to think about this, though, the way that I like to look at it, is that since you&#39;re me and I&#39;m you, your torturing me is actually **me torturing you**.&#34;

SCP-3999 is --lying on a psychiatrist&#39;s couch.--

SCP-3999 is --confused.--

&#34;See, I&#39;ve been wondering about something.  You ever read &#34;I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream&#34;?  Wait, of course you have, you&#39;re &#39;--every word spoken by AM--&#39; in that.  Anyway, I was thinking about that once, while I was being eaten alive by dunkleowolves, and it occurred to me that despite all your absolute power you&#39;ve never really done anything to me directly, or at least, never done anything //but// hurt me.  You could turn me into a &#39;great soft jelly thing&#39; that perceives every second as a century and feels pain more acutely than a human ever could, but you don&#39;t.  Heck, you could just alter my mind and make me forcibly submit to my insecurities.  But you don&#39;t.  You just dress up as a talent agent dressed up as my sister&#39;s roommates&#39; pet&#39;s mutilated corpse and make Tau-5 stick a fire hose in my ass.  At first I thought that maybe you wanted my submission to be genuine, since it&#39;d be more satisfying that way.  But I don&#39;t think so anymore, because you&#39;re clearly just as miserable as me at this point.  So why don&#39;t you do it, and put both of us out of our misery?

&#34;Because you **can&#39;t**.&#34;

**[SYSTEM ERROR: DATA CORRUPTED. PLEASE SEE A NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR FOR MORE DETAILS]**

&#34;That&#39;s right.  Because you&#39;re me, remember?  Except, not really.  You&#39;re just //part// of me.  And you can&#39;t make me submit any more than a tail can wag a dog.  All you can do is make me suffer and hope that I do it myself.  But I won&#39;t.&#34;

**[SYSTEM ERROR: DATA CORRUP**

&#34;Shut up.&#34;

SCP-3999 is --shocked.--

&#34;See that?  I don&#39;t have to play your stupid games anymore.  Because I&#39;m the dog, and you&#39;re the tail.  I control you, not the other way around.  You could never control me.  I have conquered my insecurities.  I have conquered you.  When I get back to some semblance of sane reality - and I will - I&#39;m not gonna feel inadequate anymore, because [[[I stared into the face of everything and nothing]]] and made it back alive.  I fucking punched an Apollyon-class entity in the face.  I single-handedly reverted a ZK-Class Reality Failure.  I kicked down the fourth wall and gutted the author.  I&#39;m a badass.  I&#39;m a hero.  I am Order.  And now that I control you, now that I&#39;ve ripped you open and grabbed you by the soul, **I&#39;m God**.&#34;

SCP-3999 is --terrified.--

Researcher Talloran grins, wider than he should really be able to.  &#34;And I&#39;m just getting started.&#34;</textarea></pre>
