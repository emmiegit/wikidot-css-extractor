Carlos was a man dedicated to hard work and discipline. He often said it&#39;s what got him through grad school, aside from casual alcoholism. He had a strict routine, moral compass, the whole thing. Even his own mom told him he needed to loosen up sometimes, to which he would laugh and wave her off.  Maybe that was why his stomach turned when he noticed himself casting sidelong glances at her, looking a bit longer than was necessary.

Carlos’ best friend was strange. He thought about it as she rolled a joint, eyes flicking up to watch whatever low quality Netflix show they agreed on that night. It wasn&#39;t something he could describe, just an uncomfortable feeling he got from time to time, which he worked tirelessly to suppress. She looked back and met his eye, her eyebrows raising.

“What?” She said playfully.

Carlos thought for a moment. “Whatever happened to that guy you were talking to? Isaac I think? Haven&#39;t heard about him in a bit.”

She sucked her teeth, shaking her head. “Dumped him.”

Carlos raised his eyebrows, trying not to seem at all happy. “Oh? Why?”

She shrugged. “I dunno.”

“You don&#39;t know?” He said, clicking his tongue. “C’mon, there has to be a reason.”

She didn&#39;t respond for a moment, sparking the joint and taking a long drag before handing it to him. “He wanted me to meet his mom, and that&#39;s.. Not really my thing, I guess.”

Carlos took the joint and rolled his eyes, taking a drag. “Knew it.”

She looked offended for a moment, scoffing. “The fuck is that supposed to mean?”

“Come on, as soon as they want you to get serious, you bail.” It was true. She had a list of partners longer than he could count that she kicked to the curb the moment they started wanting anything more than seeing her once a month.

“C’mon, do you see me ever being in a relationship?” She asked, rolling her eyes.

“I mean, if you wanted to, I guess.” Carlos mumbles, leaning back on the couch and letting the pleasant high roll over him. 

She sighed, reclining on the couch next to him. “I don&#39;t think I do.” She said, more to herself than him.

They sat in comfortable silence, finishing off the remainder of the joint. Carlos eventually nodded off, and Josephina tossed a blanket over his lap, listening to him snore.

“I don&#39;t think.” She said.</textarea></pre>
