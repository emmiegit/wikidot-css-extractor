&gt; [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/log-of-extranormal-events | Extranormal Event]]] 8832 (EE-8832) was a singular episode of anomalous armed conflict, which occurred in several anomalously-connected locations.  Significant levels of thaumaturgical energies interfered with MTF recordings and in the recovery of physical evidence. 
&gt; 
&gt; No persistent containment procedures are required beyond those taken immediately to ameliorate threats to normalcy directly in response to EE-8832.

++++ __Preceding Events__:
**__[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5267 | Containment Breach of SCP-5267]]]__**.
On 1 July, 1993, unknown forces breached the ruins housed within SCP-5267. Foundation forces were notified immediately due to the triggering of motion sensors and countermeasures in the area.  Motion was logged for fifteen minutes and forty-two seconds.  By the time containment specialists arrived at the anomaly, none of the culprits were present.  Despite the detonation of three explosive mines, no bodies or blood was found.  A small amount of charred clay and moss was found in the blast zone of detonated ordnance.  

Inside the ruins of the fort contained in SCP-5267, a wall of the throne room was found to have been demolished with explosives.  The revealed chamber contained numerous chests and display pedestals.  Any material goods stored within were taken with the breaching individuals, but residue from thaumaturgical ritual items was diffuse within the chamber.  Foundation surveyors had missed the chamber due to a subtle cognitohazard worked into the mortar between stones that made up the wall.  Some small residue of blood dating to the 2^^nd^^ century CE was found worked into the mortar.  

**__[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5512 | Diego Marquez – PoI-8832 sighting]]]__**.
On 3, July, 1993, members of MTF-Omega-20 (“Thought Police”) confirm siting of Diego Marquez/SCP-4612-B in Manhattan, New York City.  Marquez is witnessed entering the Grand Central Library.  Mobilization orders are issued but not completed due to the events in York.

| caption=York Art Gallery moments before the explosion destroyed the front elevation.]]

On 3 July, 1993, at 08:00 hours, an explosion occurred at the Gallery which contained SCP-3743-A-2, only known functioning Way to SCP-3743-B.  Explosion is determined to be thaumaturgical in nature, theorized to be a forcing open of the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/serpent-s-hand-hub | Way]]].  CC-TV footage in the area revealed an assault force of several dozen armed individuals, dressed in camouflage.

The assault coincided with several other explosions across Europe: Madrid, Nice, Budapest, and Istanbul.[[footnote]]All eventually found to be thaumaturgical in nature.[[/footnote]]  A cover story was developed and released to the public with the help of affected governments concerning a concerted terrorist attack.  Any witnesses of the assault force were amnesticized during cleanup operations.

-----

++++ __Mobilization__
Within an hour, Site-91, only sixteen kilometers outside York, had mobilized forces to investigate.  Given the explosion’s location at SCP-3743-A-2, it was theorized that the attack was focused on the pocket dimension designated SCP-3743-B.  

Director Varga ordered a mobilization of the Project Hecatoncheires joint task force.  In the months since the Way designated SCP-3743-A-1 was discovered, and ultimately neutralized, researchers at Site-91 had investigated the originating rituals thoroughly; the thaumaturgical research staff were able to determine a mechanism to reactivate the Way.  As SCP-3743-A-1 also led to SCP-3743-B, it was targeted as an insertion point.

Approximately two hours after losing contact with command, Agent Rebekah Douglas contacted Site-91 and requested medical evacuation to a location on the southern plains of Greece, just south of Tripoli.

Remnants of the joint task force, along with members of GoI-8832 (“The Second Haptic Assembly”), were found sheltering in the temple structure previously recorded as existing within the pocket dimension designated SCP-3743-B.  The structure had weathered significant damage from explosive ordnance and anomalous means.

4 July, 1993
Agent Rebekah Douglas


By now you’ve watched the tapes, what you can anyway.  Apparently, the Matriarch’s plan if she couldn’t outright wipe the cultists out was to rewrite history.  Some sort of blood sacrifice ritual to cancel out the temple having ever been moved off the plain back in Ancient Greek days. If she’d succeeded, Marquez… or Euboea, I guess, would have been screwed – none of the traps or preparations he’d made would be there, and maybe the cultists also.  Who knows how that would have rewritten things?  But I guess we don’t have to worry about that.  The spell wasn’t successful.  Not completely. 

I don’t know if I caused Sahara’s death, but I feel like I did.  The others certainly think so.  By the time I got back to the temple, I could see it on all their faces – except maybe Waltham’s.  My fault.

What did we gain? We interfered in a war between two ancient cults and we lost two people.  Matriarch’s army was destroyed, that had to hurt, but the temple is no longer the cult’s safe haven.  And now, we don’t know where any of them are.  Took me over an hour to find a way to communicate with Site-91, and that was by pay phone.  

The more time goes by, the less I think we’ll be able to contain any of these people. Maybe we should be content to put them in the ground and call it a day.

We brought the pedestal back, the thaumaturges are analyzing it.  I tried to get a read on it, but all I felt was her.  She did it on purpose.  Figured it was powered by blood like the rest of Daeva nonsense and she co-opted the ritual.  Guess that’s something.

Dir. Varga,

I think I’m not alone in being disappointed with the results of yesterday’s mobilization.  Waltham is injured, we lost both primary targets, and Captain Zadeh is dead.  

Before I get into the nitty gritty, I want to commend Sergeant Waltham in all aspects of her performance. Without her, we would have been a much worse situation on several occasions.  Her actions saved the lives of her fellow task force members on numerous occasions.  If my opinion is relevant at all, I think a battlefield commission is in order. She’s going to be a great leader someday.

As for Douglas.  She’s out of control.  She doesn’t follow directions and she decides the best course of action without much thought to the consequences.  I’ve looked over the past year’s action reports and she has shown a growing tendency to just do what she wants.  She sees an opportunity to hurt the target, and she does it.  In Mongolia, she shot the Matriarch without much warning.  It didn’t kill her – is she dead already? I’m confused by how that woman is walking around – but it started a chain of events that ended in losing custody of the anomaly and potentially to yesterday’s loss.  

Captain Zadeh’s death, while not entirely on Douglas’ shoulders, could not have happened without her ill-advised actions in the field.  This cannot continue.  Either she shapes up, or I don’t use her in the field again.  

Sincerely,

Captain al Hasin
Interim Joint Task Force Field Command
