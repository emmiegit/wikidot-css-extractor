**Item #:** SCP-7000-EX

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Explained

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-7000 is to be kept in a standard medium-sized object containment locker outside of testing purposes. Research staff during experimentation are required to log into the record system who the test subject is, when the test took place, and the numerical value.--

SCP-7000-EX is no longer required to be in foundation containment and the dismantled parts are to be disposed of safely.

**Description:** SCP-7000-EX is a toy named CalcuCool™. SCP-7000-EX consists of a plastic, blue, 30cm-diameter hemisphere with five indents on the round side of the hemisphere that correspond to the five fingers of a standard human left hand. It also includes a velcro strap to secure one&#39;s hand to the device and a 5-digit number display. Due to the circumstances of its acquisition, SCP-7000-EX is not to be dismantled until further notice.

SCP-7000-EX was discovered during a Foundation raid on a defunct toy factory. The owners of this factory had been recently bought out by a subsidiary of Marshall, Carter and Dark before closing down, thus prompting the Foundation to investigate.

**Addendum 7000.1:** Documents found with SCP-7000.
Upon discovery in said defunct toy factory, a booklet containing the instructional manual, and an overview of the product was found.

**Dr. Wilson:** Shut u- I mean fuck I- that&#39;s not important right now! I just need to tell you something.

**Dr. Vanin:** Okay...

**Dr. Wilson:** You uhh... gelled your hair very nicely today and... I think you&#39;re a hard-working person.

//Dr. Vanin stares at Dr. Wilson for several seconds.//

There&#39;s no other way.
@@ @@
Every stage of my life I&#39;ve gone past I feel like I come out of the experience as a worse person than when I started. After High school, after college, all I gain is more bitterness and less friends.
Like even after I got my driver&#39;s license I didn&#39;t feel accomplished, I just started to hate women drivers more like god what is wrong with me?
@@ @@
Every research project I&#39;ve led here was just some dead-end fucking old wives&#39; tale that those agents bring back because they were bored. At least in my last Site, no one stared at me like I&#39;m some homeless guy that walked in and the weird shit I get assigned has //something// to research on. I feel so isolated from other every human being in this building.
I walk past the thaumaturgy department every day and see them doing some colourful magic or looking at something actually worthwhile. Meanwhile, I&#39;m stuck with some elitist prick who thinks he&#39;s better than me and &#34;having the bigger number doesn&#39;t matter&#34; fuck you Pete die in a hole, and also to that bald, disfigured shit [[footnote]]Presumed to be Site Director Kumar[[/footnote]], he just never shuts up it&#39;s always:
@@ @@
&#34;Hey Jonsey, go research this shitty toy I found in some fucking warehouse&#34;
&#34;Go look at this broken computer mouse I think it&#39;s anomalous&#34;
&#34;Jonsey I need you to waste your time over here instead of over there&#34;
JUST FUCK OFF PLEASE YOUR COMPUTER HAS A VIRUS BECAUSE YOU CLICKED ON THOSE FUCKING PORN ADS IT&#39;S NOT A CHAOS INSURGENCY HACK.
@@ @@
And then there&#39;s the number. This FUCKING number. It&#39;s right. It says I can raise it but nothing I do works. I don&#39;t know if this shit is the first actual anomaly I&#39;ve found ever since being posted to this god-forsaken site or what but I&#39;m terrified of it.
@@ @@
I&#39;ve donated to 6 charities in the past week but the fucking number still goes down and down and down and down.
@@ @@
Maybe I&#39;m just that shitty of a person and the way the rest of the site looks at me tells me a lot. Maybe I deserve to be where I am today. Either way, this is the only way out I can see working out for me. I don&#39;t know what happens when the number hits zero and I don&#39;t wanna be the guy that finds out so get some other miserable sack of shit to do it for you.

Following this incident, SCP-7000-EX was repaired and more rigorous testing was conducted. Among the 62 members of staff and D-class personnel of differing criminal records, religious backgrounds, and several other criteria that were tested, no discernable pattern was found. Dismantling of SCP-7000-EX revealed no anomalous components and analysis of the main software showed only basic code for a random number generator.

Object class was updated to Explained.
