**Item #:** SCP-6092

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6092 specimens are to be contained in a glass vivarium in Site-19. Various plants are to be kept and watered in the chamber as well to create a natural oxygen source.

No caffeinated beverages are to be brought within 50 meters of SCP-6092 containment chamber in order to discourage the flies from attempting to breach containment. The exception to this is a sixteen ounce stainless steel coffee cup that is to be refilled with standard black coffee every two days. This cup must be left in SCP-6092 glass chamber at all times aside from replenishment.  The specimen populace of SCP-6092 is to be manually reduced every nine to twelve days to prevent overpopulation. Under no circumstance should any personnel with a habit of drinking coffee (on average 2-3 times a week) enter SCP-6092 containment cell.

MTF Task Force Lambda-12 (&#34;Pest Control&#34;) is to be dispatched to areas of high concentration of SCP-6092 instances. Task Force members are to call for the evacuation of buildings infested with SCP-6092 under the guise of pest control services. Any Task Force personnel that regularly consume caffeine are to be exempt from operations. Instances of SCP-6092 outside of the containment cell are to be terminated immediately.

**Description:** SCP-6092 is an insect species of unknown origin that resembles a variation of the genus //Drosophila melanogaster,// [[footnote]]Commonly known as the &#34;fruit fly&#34;, &#34;lesser fruit fly&#34;, or &#34;vinegar fly&#34;[[/footnote]] approximately 3 mm in length and 2 mm in width. SCP-6092 instances are yellow-brown in color with large vermillion colored eyes, appearing similar to that of a normal fruit fly.

Adult SCP-6092 specimens will spend the entirety of their lifetime attempting to reach the nearest caffeinated beverage, upon which they will submerge themselves. SCP-6092 shows a resistance to temperatures of up to 71°C, allowing the flies to survive in warm fluid environments such as coffee. Upon entering a liquid, they will proceed to lay anywhere between one to five hundred eggs. The caffeine in beverages appears to act as a fertilizer, and eggs laid in them will develop into adult SCP-6092 instances over the course of 1-2 weeks. The life cycle of SCP-6092 is identical to that of a regular fruit fly. 

Humans that swallow SCP-6092 eggs, hereby referred to as SCP-6092-1, will undergo a series of symptoms. Approximately 12-24 hours after consumption, SCP-6092-1 will experience symptoms comparable to that of a caffeine withdrawal. These include mild fatigue, headaches, insomnia, nausea, depression, anxiety, and rarely, hallucinations. These side effects will progressively get more severe until SCP-6092-1 consumes another caffeinated beverage.

After this point, side effects will become unpredictable. However, nearly all instances of SCP-6092-1 have consistently reported the following:
* irritability/restlessness
* itchiness
* cysts appearing on the arms, back, face, and/or chest.  
* formication [[footnote]]The feeling of insects crawling across or underneath the skin[[/footnote]]
* tinnitus (described as a buzzing sound)
* coughing up a small, tan mucus
* strong urge to consume caffeine

The following side effects have been recorded but have not appeared consistently:
* hallucinations
* muscle spasms
* projectile vomiting
* photophobia [[footnote]]Fear of light[[/footnote]]
* interest in consuming decaying produce
* uncontrollable screaming
* drastic weight loss
* self-inflicted scratch wounds

Accidental consumption of SCP-6092 eggs is not uncommon due to their small size. Victims with a longer, consistent habit of consuming caffeine tend to experience more severe side effects over a longer period of time. Swallowing a single egg is enough to afflict an organism. There is no known cure.

**Discovery:** SCP-6092 was first discovered in a cafe in ███████, Iowa, which was part of the popular multinational fast food coffeehouse chain ████████. The coffeehouse was temporarily closed on █/█/2021 by ██████ Department of Health after the restaurant received a poor score on a routine health inspection due to multiple violations of standard health and safety protocol. Health inspector Stanley Daniels reported that the cafe had &#34;a substantial amount of flies living in the kitchen which proposed a concern that the customers orders could be contaminated&#34;. Additional reports revealed that a large amount of restaurant patrons had described bizarre symptoms of an unknown illness. In some cases, fatality has been recorded with an unclear cause of death.

Several SCP-6092 specimens were withdrawn and put into the care of the Foundation, as well as restaurant manager Samson Bowyer and two restaurant clients who were later interviewed (See Addendum 6092.1-3). The remaining SCP-6092 instances in the restaurant have been terminated and the restaurant is closed indefinitely.

**INTERVIEW LOG 6092.1**

**SUBJECT:** Chris Santana

**INTERVIEWER:** Dr. Linan

**Foreword:** Chris Santana, age 22, taken in by the Foundation shortly before the closing of ████████. Santana was tested for the presence of SCP-6092, and the interview has been moved to a room with a glass partition between Dr. Linan and the subject.

**&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**

**LINAN:** Hello, Mr. Santana. How are you feeling?

**SUBJECT:** Um, fine I guess. Doctor, what is going on here? Did I do something wrong?

**LINAN:** No, nothing. We just want to know how you feel right now.

**SUBJECT:** Why? Where the hell am I? 

**LINAN:** Where we are is not relevant. We just want to ask you a few questions, and you&#39;ll be out of here.

**SUBJECT:** But why do you want to ask me anything? I have literally nothing to tell you.

**LINAN:** That&#39;s not true. You were at the ████████ very close to its shutdown.

**SUBJECT:** Oh, well, yeah. Wait, are you part of the health department or something?

**LINAN:** Something like that.

**SUBJECT:** Well, okay. You should have just said this is about the ████████. I don&#39;t really know much about that place though. I&#39;ve only been there once. Did you slip something in my coffee?

**LINAN:** What makes you say that?

**SUBJECT:** Maybe its cause I have no recollection of coming here? I was leaving with my drink and then a bunch of black vans were outside. Next thing I knew, I was in a cell like some kind of prisoner. I didn&#39;t do anything, Doctor.

**LINAN:** You did consume a beverage from ████████ then? How did you feel after drinking it?

**SUBJECT:** Uh, normal. It was my first coffee, ever. It had a lot of sugar and milk in it, so maybe I felt kind of sick after. Or I should say, I would have, given I wasn&#39;t //kidnapped//. 

**LINAN:** Alright. Do you want to tell us a bit about yourself, for the record?

**SUBJECT:** If I do, will I get out of here sooner?

**LINAN:** Most likely.

**SUBJECT:** Okay. My name is Chris Jordan Santana, I&#39;m 22 years old. I&#39;m a senior at ████████ ████████ University. I have a younger sister in high school, but keep her out of this. Same with my parents um, I mean, they obviously aren&#39;t in high school. I meant I don&#39;t want anyone else I know to get kidnapped and interrogated. Is that good? I&#39;d rather not say anything else.

**LINAN:** We aren&#39;t going to interrogate anyone else you know, don&#39;t worry. And yes, that&#39;s fine. So, what did you know about that ████████?

**SUBJECT:** I already told you, that&#39;s the last place I was before I got here. I believe it was a few days ago, though I can&#39;t even remember correctly. Also, you never answered my question. Did you knock me out or something?

**LINAN:** What is your relationship with the company? Or, more specifically, this single location of ████████?

**SUBJECT:** Sometimes I would go there and get donuts or a breakfast sandwich. I had never actually gotten a coffee from there until right before you kidnapped me. I&#39;m not a coffee drinker, though basically everyone I know is.

**LINAN:** So what did you order specifically?

**SUBJECT:** A latte with cream and sugar, I believe. A lot of a sugar. That&#39;s what I wanted, at least. I think the kid working there screwed up my order. It was pretty bitter and dark, and there were some little coffee bean particles or something in it. Don&#39;t quote me on that though, I&#39;m no coffee expert.

**LINAN:** Interesting. What enticed you to order coffee, considering you don&#39;t drink it?

**SUBJECT:** Well, I wasn&#39;t lying about not drinking coffee. I&#39;ve never been a coffee drinker. I mean, I&#39;ve had sips here and there, just to try it. But I never ordered it for myself. Not until recently, I mean. I read some benefits of drinking coffee, and with midterms coming up and... I&#39;ve just been kinda stressed. I also feel really tired all the time, and I&#39;m sick of it. My sister and some of my friends drink coffee regularly, and they said I should start with a lot of sugar and milk.

**LINAN:** Ah, so you wanted to start drinking coffee at the recommendation of your friends?

**SUBJECT:** I guess you could say that. I just wanted to try it out, see if I made me feel any better.

**LINAN:** Would you say there was any &#34;urge&#34; to go to ████████ specifically?

**SUBJECT:** Uh, no..I don&#39;t think so. I could have gone to any nearby coffeehouse. I only went to ████████ because it was convenient. It&#39;s pretty close to my campus and it&#39;s pretty popular. Cheap too.

**LINAN:** Have you drank any coffee since then?

**SUBJECT:** No, I haven&#39;t. I was considering getting some later though, when I get out of here......Um, when am I getting out of here, actually?

**LINAN:** We want to bring you back when you are completely healthy again. You are exhibiting symptoms such as fatigue and anxiety, correct?

**SUBJECT:** Yeah, I mean, a little bit. What, do you think I&#39;m sick or something?

**LINAN:** Not in the normal sense. But, I have no doubt we can help you out.

**SUBJECT:** Soon, right?

**LINAN:** I&#39;m sorry, can you elaborate on that?

**SUBJECT:** I mean, am I gonna get treated soon? And is it a short treatment? I hate to sound like an impatient brat but to be fair, you //did// kinda abduct me against my will.

**LINAN:** I can understand how you might feel about suddenly being brought in here. However, I want to clarify that we merely want to ask you a few questions, and after which we will have you back into the world as if none of this had ever happened. 

**SUBJECT:** Pretty bold of you to think you can just kidnap people and expect them to do these dumb interviews. I already made it clear that I have nothing of value to tell you. In fact, this is a waste of my time too. God, how many classes am I missing right now? Do you know how much you might have screwed me over?

**LINAN:** (sighs) Alright, we are almost done here. What was the restaurant like? Did you see any insects or flies? 

**SUBJECT:** What? No. I mean, the place looked clean. I don&#39;t wanna say it was fancy or anything, cause it wasn&#39;t. It was your average modern fast food restaurant. If there were flies or anything it was probably in the kitchen or something...actually that&#39;s probably why the place was closed.

**LINAN:** Something like that. Okay, I think we are done here.

**SUBJECT:** Hey doc, one more thing?

**LINAN:** Yes?
 
**SUBJECT:** I know I was a dick to you but I think that&#39;s understandable, right? Do you mind if I request something? 

**LINAN:** Go for it.

**SUBJECT:** Do you, um, have any coffee here? Surely you have a coffee machine in the break room or something. I&#39;m really craving it. It&#39;s the least you can do for a prisoner.

**LINAN:** You want coffee?

**SUBJECT:** Yeah. The truth is....there is something in my head that is telling me to get some coffee.

**LINAN:** What do you mean?

**SUBJECT:** It&#39;s hard to explain. It&#39;s like an inner voice. I trust it. Okay, don&#39;t look at me like that. I&#39;m not crazy...it&#39;s not like a literal voice. Damn...what I&#39;m trying to say is I could just go for one more cup of coffee. After that, I think I&#39;ll quit it for good. Clearly coffee has not helped improve my life.

**LINAN:** So, you are done with coffee then?

**SUBJECT:** Yeah. I&#39;ve been thinking about it since I woke up at this place. It&#39;s just not worth it. I mean, I don&#39;t wanna end up here again. So just one more for the road, y&#39;know?

**LINAN:** Alright, one more cup of coffee? We&#39;ll see.

**&lt;END LOG&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Santana was transferred to a standard cell indefinitely, shortly after receiving his beverage. His body was later found in his cell, covered in hundreds of instances of SCP-6092. Autopsy report revealed that the cause of death was mix between a sudden brain aneurysm and █████ ███████. Security footage revealed Santana died mere moments after drinking from his beverage. He was to be released on █/██/2021.

**INTERVIEW LOG 6092.2A**

**SUBJECT:** James Anderson

**INTERVIEWER:** Dr. Linan

**Foreword:** James Anderson, age 21, taken in by the Foundation shortly before the closing of ████████. The interview with Anderson was conducted in the same room as Chris Santana (See SCP-6092 Interview Log-6092.1).

**&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**

**LINAN:** Hello, Mr. Anderson. 

**SUBJECT:** Hey.

**LINAN:** How are you feeling?

**SUBJECT:** Not great. Doctor, where am I?

**LINAN:** That is not relevant. We are not going to hurt you. We just want to ask you a few questions.

**SUBJECT:** I&#39;m sorry, I was just curious.

**LINAN:** No need to apologize, that is to be expected. I can assure you that after this interview is over we&#39;ll get you back to your life.

**SUBJECT:** Alright....ask away.

**LINAN:** Well first, would you care to tell us a little bit about yourself?

**SUBJECT:** I mean, if I have to. I&#39;m James Anderson, and I&#39;m 21. I&#39;ve gone to ████████ ████████ University for three years now. 

**LINAN:** That&#39;s sufficient. So, would you like to elaborate on how you are feeling?

**SUBJECT:** Not great? Well...I feel like I do most of the time. Kinda tired, depressed, apathetic, even.

**LINAN:** How long would you say you have been experiencing these symptoms?

**SUBJECT:** Basically my whole life, I think. I guess you could say they&#39;ve gotten worse recently. I&#39;ve had diagnosed depression and anxiety since I was in high school. It&#39;s nothing too severe, but it sucks. 

**LINAN:** So, what is your relationship with coffee? Do you think it&#39;s affected your mood?

**SUBJECT:** You kinda remind me of my therapist. She would ask me similar questions. Uh, anyway...coffee. I&#39;ve been drinking it for years. It&#39;s helped me wake up in the morning, you know? I&#39;ve never thought about it affecting my mood. I don&#39;t think caffeine can do that to you though. Always just assumed it was cause of stress and boredom.

**LINAN:** Have you noticed any symptoms you might consider unnatural?

**SUBJECT:** Unnatural? I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t really know what you mean.

**LINAN:** Well, we&#39;ll get back to that. Let&#39;s get on the topic of ████████. What is your relationship with this company? How long have you gone to this cafe?

**SUBJECT:** I mean, it&#39;s a coffee company. I&#39;ve gone to a lot of coffee places over the years. That was one of them. Sucks that it got shut down, it was pretty close to my campus. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll go to places like that again, though, if the rumors are true..

**LINAN:** Care to elaborate on these rumors?

**SUBJECT:** Well, the place got shut down right? By a health inspector? That seems like a pretty big deal. I don&#39;t really know what they did specifically. Well, that&#39;s not actually true. I have a pal who worked there for like two weeks. He told me the kitchen itself was clean, but there were apparently a ton of flies in there. He reported it to the manager but he just brushed it off. He just stopped going in after that.

**LINAN:** I see. How many times would you say you went to █████████?

**SUBJECT:** I can&#39;t give you a specific number, but I will say I think on average I went two-three times a week. And that&#39;s over the course of like....four months? I would go in, get my coffee, and then get out. Sometimes I would go through the drive thru instead. Most of the time I went through the drive thru, actually.

**LINAN:** Alright, now would you care to touch on the symptoms?

**SUBJECT:** I still don&#39;t really know what you mean by that.

**LINAN:** I&#39;m going to be straight with you, Mr. Anderson. Truth is, the flies in █████████ might have laid eggs inside customer&#39;s beverages. 

**SUBJECT:** That&#39;s disgusting. Is that why it got shut down?

**LINAN:** Part of it. Normally that wouldn&#39;t be so much of an issue, as fruit fly eggs can&#39;t normally survive in scalding hot beverages. But these flies are different. It&#39;s safe to assume that if you drank a beverage at this █████████, you could have swallowed an egg.

**SUBECT:** Oh... I get it now. You think I might be sick from the contamination?

**LINAN:** Exactly. But not a normal type of sick. These eggs can cause side effects that one might consider anomalous. So, I&#39;ll ask again: Have you experienced any symptoms you might consider unnatural?

**SUBJECT:** I don&#39;t really know the validity of that statement, but I can tell you this: I&#39;ve see flies in my room sometimes. I even see them in my dreams sometimes. Man, that&#39;s kinda freaky. Doctor, am I gonna turn into a fly-human thing?

**LINAN:** We have never seen that happen before, so I wouldn&#39;t worry about it.

**SUBJECT:** Oh, and another thing: Sometimes, when I sneeze, I swear....I can see it twitch. Maybe I&#39;m just crazy. Surely I imagined that, right?

**LINAN:** Truth is, we know little about this phenomenon. Don&#39;t worry, though. We are almost done here. Mr. Anderson, I am sure you are eager to get out of here, correct?

[Subject is staring at the floor.]

**SUBJECT:** I......I don&#39;t even know anymore.

**LINAN:** This is the last question. Did you go to other coffeeshops during the same period you regularly went to █████████?

[Subject looks up.]

**SUBJECT:** ...I&#39;m sorry, can you repeat that?

**LINAN:** Mr. Anderson, did you go to other coffeeshops during the same period you regularly went to █████████?

**SUBJECT:** I.....no. No, I didn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t.....

**LINAN:** So, you did //not// go to other coffeeshops?

[Subject faced down and stared at hands. Subject refused to answer further questions.]

**&lt;END LOG&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** After the interview, Anderson was transported to a standard cell until a later interview (See Addendum Interview Log-6092.2B).

**SUBJECT:** James Anderson

**INTERVIEWER:** Dr. Linan

**Foreword:** Anderson was forcefully brought in for a second interview approximately thirteen days after his original interview (See Addendum Interview Log-6092.2A).

**&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**

**LINAN:** Hello, Mr. Anderson. How are you feeling?

**SUBJECT:** What? What...

**LINAN:** Mr. Anderson, can you hear me?

**SUBJECT:** Doctor, help me. Yes, I can hear you. I can hear you.

**LINAN:** Can you describe how you are feeling?

[Subject lowers head into hands.]

**SUBJECT:** Doctor, I need help. I feel...horrible. My head hurts and I&#39;m so tired and anxious all the time. Doctor, I really need some coffee right now. 

**LINAN:** Alright, first I need you to relax. I can&#39;t give you any coffee right now. Are you only experiencing these symptoms?

[Subject raises head.]

**SUBJECT:** No, no, no, no. I um, I have a noise in my ear. It&#39;s a buzzing in my ear all the time. It&#39;s so loud, Doctor. Please make it stop, please.... I need some coffee right now. 

**LINAN:** Mr. Anderson, why are you hiding your wrist?

**SUBJECT:** Please, please don&#39;t make me look at it Doctor. Please, I can&#39;t look at it.

**LINAN:** I need you to show me your wrist.

**SUBJECT:** Doctor, if I show you my wrist, will you give me some coffee? Please, Doctor. Please, swear to me.

**LINAN:** Alright. Please show me your wrist.

[Subject shows wrist, revealing a nickel-sized cyst.]

**SUBJECT:** Doctor, please, please help me. It....it scares me, Doctor. It moves sometimes. Doctor, I&#39;m never getting out of here, am I?

**LINAN:** Please slow down, Mr. Anderson. It moves? Can you elaborate on that?

**SUBJECT:** Look, Doctor. It&#39;s moving right now. 

**LINAN:** Mr. Anderson, your arm is shaking. 

**SUBJECT:** Doctor, please. I need you to help me. Please, I need some coffee right now. Doctor, I feel it crawling...under my arm....please, help me.

**LINAN:** What is crawling under your arm?

**SUBJECT:** You can&#39;t see it....you can&#39;t see it...It&#39;s there. In my arm and under my skin. It&#39;s crawling on my veins. Please help me.

[Subject falls out of chair]

**LINAN:** Mr. Anderson? Anderson, are you okay?

[Subject is lying in a supine position on the floor and sobbing.]

**LINAN:** Mr. Anderson, we are sending in personnel to assist you.

[Subject is coughing violently as SCP-6092 instances emerge from his mouth and nasal passage.]

**LINAN:** Mr. Anderson?

[Subject screams.]

**&lt;END LOG&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** After being treated, Anderson was transferred to a standard cell indefinitely. No further interviews have been conducted.

**INTERVIEW LOG 6092.3**

**SUBJECT:** Samson Bowyer

**INTERVIEWER:** Dr. Linan

**Foreword:** Samson Bowyer, age 37, taken in for questioning for involvement in the █████████ shutdown. Interview was conducted in the same room as Santana (See Addendum Interview 6092.1).

**&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**

**LINAN:** Hello, Mr. Bowyer.

**SUBJECT:** Hello.

**LINAN:** As the record states, you were aware of SCP-6092&#39;s effects, but did nothing to prevent it from becoming a safety hazard?

**SUBJECT:** I knew that there was something odd about the flies, if that&#39;s what you mean. I did not mean to cause harm to anyone, especially my customers.

**LINAN:** Well, I think we&#39;re past that now. And you didn&#39;t answer the question.

**SUBJECT:** I found the flies in the kitchen, originally. They were in a small corner, near the trash, and there were only a few of them. I didn&#39;t think much of it...but then more of them started appearing, closer to the coffee machines and cups. At this point, I thought there was a potential for the flies to be contaminating the customer&#39;s drinks.

**LINAN:** And yet, the flies still found themselves in customer&#39;s drinks.

**SUBJECT:** I was getting to that...I swatted the flies, as many as I could find. I thought that would solve the problem. Yet, more of them came back. As if they were attracted to the coffee. I thought maybe I should start making them pay for it...heh. Sorry, just a bad joke.

**LINAN:** So, you couldn&#39;t stop the flies from getting to the coffee?

**SUBJECT:** Sort of. I want to claim some responsibility for this incident....you think I can live with myself knowing I might have ruined so many innocent lives? ..I&#39;m sorry, that was uncalled for. I could have stopped the flies, I know I could have. But I didn&#39;t....because...well....I didn&#39;t. I couldn&#39;t do it...

**LINAN:** Care to elaborate on that?

**SUBJECT:** I was starting to realize there was a relationship between the sales and the flies...I might as well have been crazy. The sales were going up, and I needed them. The flies were like a good luck charm of sorts. I thought it was just superstition, but then... I saw a fly in the lounge. And it flew into a woman&#39;s drink when she wasn&#39;t looking. Then...

**LINAN:** Then?

**SUBJECT:** Then that woman came back every day. Every day, then multiple times a day, for weeks. At that point I thought...maybe the flies were the best thing that ever happened to █████████. And then she never came back. God damn it....I can&#39;t do this, Doctor.

[Subject lowers head into hands.]

**LINAN:** How long was this before the closing of █████████?

[Subject stays silent.]

**LINAN:** Mr. Bowyer, how long have you been exploiting the flies?

[Subject stays silent.]

**LINAN:** Mr. Bowyer, I want to tell you a story. A few days ago we interviewed two young men who went to your coffee shop. A Mr. Anderson and Mr. Santana. Do you know them?

[Subject raises head.]

**SUBJECT:** ...Yes. I know an Anderson. James Anderson, correct? 

**LINAN:** I&#39;ll add another question. Mr. Bowyer, when you were in your cell earlier, did you happen to hear any..screaming?

[Subject stays silent.]

**LINAN:**  You are the only person who would know how many people might be in danger. So Mr. Bowyer, I&#39;ll ask again: How long have you been exploiting these flies?

[Subject sits still for a few moments while staring at the floor.]

**SUBJECT:** Doctor...I need some coffee.

**LINAN:** Mr. Bowyer?

[Subject is silent.]

**LINAN:** Mr. Bowyer, can you elaborate on that?

**SUBJECT:** I...want a cup of coffee. Any kind of coffee.

**LINAN:** I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t give you any.

**SUBJECT:** My career selling coffee is over, Doctor. I need you to do this. For me. And......it. 

**LINAN:** ..Mr. Bowyer?

[Subject refused to answer any further questions.]

**&lt;END LOG&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Bowyer was denied his beverage and was transferred to a cell indefinitely. His release is currently pending. Bowyer has refused to participate in any further interviews unless he is given a caffeinated beverage.
