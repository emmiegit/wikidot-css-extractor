It&#39;s a quiet evening on Site-57.

You step out in the cold air, a hot fish and chips from the nearby store to warm you tonight. You nod to the guards as you pass them, pulling your jacket closer over your shoulders.

You&#39;re here to meet a contact - a somewhat capricious one, if you believe the stories, but he&#39;s always here on Sundays. The normal guy who meets him is sick, so you&#39;ve been selected to take his place. You&#39;re... a little uncertain about the protocol, though. This is a new one.

You find the spot - a small, shadowed part of the complex - and lean against the wall, your leg in the position you&#39;d been thoroughly instructed on. You take one of the chips and eat it - it&#39;s not part of the protocol, but it is part of the human reaction to a cold night. You pull off a piece of the battered fish, check it over, and throw it into the darkness.

It makes a small, wet sound as it lands, a wave of silence rushing in to fill the empty space. This silence feels... tenser, somehow. More... alert, and focused.

You hear something jump from the roof above you. A flash of white leaps into the darkness, making a beeline for the fish you left. You&#39;re uncertain of the protocol for this situation, but you hope the contact saw it in time, regardless.

[[=image http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/mistopheles/Mistopheles/medium.jpg]]

Two blue eyes stare out at you from the shadows. It&#39;s a white cat, looking you over. The silence is overbearing, as neither of you move. You realise you&#39;re holding your breath, so you release it. To break the tension, you jokingly ask the cat if it&#39;s the contact you&#39;re here to meet.

&#34;Hah, lucky guess, or just perceptive?&#34;

The cat puts on a toothy grin.

&#34;The names Mistopheles. Welcome to the whisper network - or, should I say, the //whisker// network.&#34;

You groan internally. It&#39;s gonna be a long night.

&#34;So! Let&#39;s get the show on the road. I tell you what I&#39;ve heard, whether that&#39;s things around town, or leaks from your place. Then, you guys go and plug those leaks. You savvy? Let&#39;s get started.&#34;

[[tab Stand-Alone SCPs]]
//&#34;Let&#39;s start with the basics - I&#39;ve heard rumours of a few of your SCPs through the whisker network. You curious?&#34;//

+++ [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4539 SCP-DECI: The Worst Calculator Ever]
//&#34;People at the University were discussing a High School where every student - every single student - failed a maths test. If I recall correctly, the original culprit was a calculator, right? You musta missed a teacher or something.&#34;//
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Author&#39;s Notes&#34; hide=&#34;- Author&#39;s Notes&#34;]]
&gt; SCP-DECI - technically SCP-4539 - is my first skip. It was based on a simple question - how do you write an SCP without numbers?
&gt;
&gt; In hindsight, it was more than a little ballsy. So far, most people seem to vote for it in //spite// of my writing, rather than //because// of it. Some day, I&#39;ll come back to it.
[[/collapsible]]
[[/tab]]
[[tab Hook, Loan and Sinker / Don Z.]]
//&#34;Hook, Loan and Sinker, eh? Yeah, pretty sure that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg. You probably wanna stop HL&amp;S, but... that&#39;d only be hiding the symptoms of a much, much larger threat... I&#39;ll tell you more when I know more.&#34;//

+++ [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4602 SCP-4602: The Money-ki Neko]
[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4602-extended-testing-log Check out the extended testing log, too!]
//&#34;Maneki-Neko? Those weird doll things? They&#39;ve always creeped me out - like you&#39;d be creeped out by a robot cartoon human. Learning that there&#39;s one that actually talks to you? I don&#39;t care if you think it&#39;s nice, it&#39;s disturbing as fuck.&#34;//
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Author&#39;s Notes&#34; hide=&#34;- Author&#39;s Notes&#34;]]
&gt; SCP-4602 is my second SCP. A skip with a more humorous bend, I feel it&#39;s a bit more fun and cute. He may be vindictive, but Tashiro is a good boy.
&gt;
&gt; As you can probably guess by the tabbing, this skip is the first breadcrumb of something bigger... but we&#39;ll see where it gets to. You never know, y&#39;know?
&gt;
&gt; Oh, and if you&#39;re wondering, apparently the extended testing log doesn&#39;t count as one of the three pages. That may not be surprising, but let&#39;s just say there was several misunderstandings that mean this is the second version of this page. I ain&#39;t that mad, I just wish people had communicated the problem to me before I actually posted it, as I couldn&#39;t have been less subtle about it without being obnoxious.

+++ [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4652 SCP-4652: Moonbeam Moonshine]
//&#34;Ah, there&#39;s been a rumour going around about someone dealing in special flasks. The drinks within allow you to, and I quote, &#39;burp lasers&#39;. You wouldn&#39;t know anything about that, would you?&#34;//
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Author&#39;s Notes&#34; hide=&#34;- Author&#39;s Notes&#34;]]
&gt; SCP-4652 was a skip I wrote in a weird mood. I just sorta rolled with whatever came out of my head. It&#39;s themed to be in Don Z&#39;s world of skips, but it&#39;s really just a fun premise.
&gt;
&gt; After my first two skips ended up long, I wanted to make one that was short and sweet. SCP-4652 was aiming to be less than 1000 words, and it technically succeeded[[footnote]]If you don&#39;t count footnotes like this...[[/footnote]]. Personally, as of making this page, it&#39;s my favourite of my skips so far.

By now, you&#39;ve eaten through most of the chips, and you&#39;ve split the fish between you two. You&#39;ve written down everything he&#39;s mentioned to you. You ask if he&#39;s forgetting anything.

He shakes his head, turning away from you. He looks over his shoulder to give you one last smile.

&#34;This was fun. I like you... what was your name, again?&#34;

You tell him.

&#34;Really? ...Huh. Feel like I heard that somewhere in the city. I&#39;d watch my back if I were you, particularly heading down Amity Street. Anyways, I&#39;ll see you around.&#34;

He scampers off, into the darkness. The quiet rolls back - a more relaxed quiet than the tense silence. You gather your notebook and the rubbish, and head back inside.
