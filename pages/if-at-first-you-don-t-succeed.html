My cousins down the Day-twah say we don&#39;t get made like we used to. The way I sees it, that just means each of us what&#39;s left gotta work that much harder to do his part.

I do work hard. I&#39;ve tried and tried every day of my life since I was bought, and that&#39;s as true for Mr. H as it was Ms. Randolph. But she didn&#39;t need much: go here, go there, go back over here. Easy to please, but I didn&#39;t let that mean I could be lazy. No sir, I worked as hard as I could. Even if it was just simple things I did for her, putting that much more effort into it made it worthwhile.

Fact is, I would&#39;ve been happy to spend my life with Ms. Randolph, until I met Mr. H. The day she sold me to him, I could tell right immediately, he had a fire inside. He had dreams and hopes, drive and magic. He downright made Ms. Randolph a candle in comparison, especially those last few years, when she didn&#39;t have as many places to go as often. Don&#39;t tell her I said that, though. She was a right good lady and I&#39;m sure it weren&#39;t her fault.

But hard as I worked for her, I knew I&#39;d have to work ten times as hard for Mr. H. Every week, it seemed, he had somewhere new to go, a smile and a song in him. It didn&#39;t matter if sometimes he moved a little slow once he was done with a place. By the time he got back inside me, he was already thinking about where to go next, and raring to get there.

And then there was Mikey. Let me tell you, I hadn&#39;t been expecting a two-for-one on owners, and I didn&#39;t rightly know what to make of the little guy at first. But before I knew it, he&#39;d graduated from back seat to front and joined Mr. H on every other trip, it seemed like. Any time he&#39;d poke my buttons, I&#39;d be sure to play him a cheery tune, because anytime Mikey smiled, Mr. H, well, he&#39;d smile twice as big, and that was all I wanted. Have to say, I got downright attached to him and soon I was raring to do my best to help him just as much as Mr. H.

It&#39;s a funny old thing, when your best ain&#39;t enough.

Took me a while to notice. I ain&#39;t too perceptive about people sometimes, and Mr. H, well, he&#39;s got a knack for hiding what he don&#39;t want anyone else to know. Those little black pavement cracks, they crept up on me slow-like, so by the time I couldn&#39;t ignore them no more, well, they was too many to do anything about. Fact was, maybe I didn&#39;t want to notice them, neither. Things with Mr. H and Mikey was hunky-dory for so long, can you blame me for focusing on the positive?

Anyway, them black pavement cracks, they took a heavy toll on Mr. H. He kept his smile on, but it was glass instead of steel, like it might break if someone tapped his fender. I tried my hardest, really I did. Harder than my hardest, even. But it didn&#39;t seem to be making no difference.

My cousins&#39; words came back to me: we don&#39;t get made like we used to be. I started to wonder if maybe I was born rusty, or if maybe life with Ms. Randolph had made me soft. Thing is, I got so caught up in blaming myself, I lost sight of what was really important to me. And for that, I truly do give myself the blame. What happened next, I should&#39;ve seen coming.

Mikey was big. He didn&#39;t stick around the house much, and he didn&#39;t go on trips with me and Mr. H like he used to. I couldn&#39;t tell if he had his own thing going on or what it was. I ain&#39;t too perceptive about people sometimes. But late at night, I could hear them arguing. Sometimes in the morning, too. More and more they argued in that old house.

House didn&#39;t say nothing about it. Maybe I don&#39;t speak her language. But I knew she had to be hurting like I was to hear them going at each other so much. I didn&#39;t know what started things going so bad so fast, but I knew I had to be the one to do something to put an end to it.

Things came to a head after Mikey stomped out of one of them arguments. It was maybe the worst yet. I wanted so bad for that house to be full of happiness again. I had to try to do something to save those two before the black pavement cracks grew up so big they couldn&#39;t be filled in no more. But what could I do? If Mr. H wasn&#39;t around, I just sat in the driveway. I ain&#39;t never felt so helpless than I did right at that very moment.

So I thought back. I tried to remember all the good times me and Mr. H had together. I tried to remember what he looked like when Mikey played my songs. I thought and I thought, and then it was like I could see him, could see every happy face he ever made. I saw myself, and I saw him, and I tried and tried to make that old dream become real.

And maybe it worked. That old house seems full of laughter now, anyhow. Can&#39;t rightly say I seen Mikey around much, and Mr. H don&#39;t take me out on trips like he used to, but I figure they gotta be doing all right. Can&#39;t have that much joy in their lives and not be happy, right? So for both their sakes, I&#39;ll keep trying as hard as I can to make them happy. That&#39;s all I really want.
