**Item #:** SCP-1535

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1535 is to be kept in a security locker at Site-18. The object should be handled carefully during testing due to its fragile nature. The lid of SCP-1535 is to be kept in a separate locker, only to be removed during testing.

**Description:** SCP-1535 is a glass mason jar manufactured by the Ball company in 1946. SCP-1535 is physically similar to a typical glass mason jar.

Anomalous properties of SCP-1535 present themselves when non-sapient entities such as insects or reptiles are placed within and the lid of SCP-1535 is sealed.

Entities present within SCP-1535 after it has been sealed gain the ability to reason, fluency in the Spanish language, familiarity with Catholicism, and knowledge of Morse code. Residents of SCP-1535 are referred to as SCP-1535-1.

Attempts to open the lid of SCP-1535 without damaging SCP-1535 have proven to be ineffective while living SCP-1535-1 are located within. The lid of SCP-1535 is removed simply when SCP-1535 no longer contains living SCP-1535-1. SCP-1535-1 expires 1-2 hours after being sealed within, presumably due to lack of oxygen.

**Interview 1535-1:** A firefly is used in the following test for ease of communication. Testing with species of reptile and insect have proven themselves to be similar in result.

SCP-1535-1 communicates by blinking in Morse code.

&gt; **SCP-1535-1:** Father, is it really you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Breen:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1535-1:** I am at your will. You understand the joy I feel now seeing you finally.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Breen:** Tell me your name.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1535-1**: I was named Camilo de Garibay after my father, also a devout servant.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Breen:** How did you get here?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1535-1:** I followed the light in the darkness.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Breen:** Could you be more specific? What happened before this?
&gt;   
&gt; **SCP-1535-1:** I… well as you know, I died by a sinful disease. Please forgive me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Breen:** You are forgiven.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1535-1:** I have always wondered, what happens now that I am here? I am accepted here, correct? I have been faithful.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Breen:** Are you aware of your present condition?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1535-1:** This is… strange, but I do not question your ways.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Breen:** Thank you. (//Breen speaks through the intercom.//) Interview is complete, please remove SCP-1535.
&gt; 
&gt; //More light can be seen flashing in increasing intervals from SCP-1535-1.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Breen:** One moment, there may be something else here.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1535-1:** I have been faithful! I have destroyed evil men for you! Please! Please let me in! Please!
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Breen:** …
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-1535-1 begins flying around SCP-1535 violently, colliding with its walls before falling to the bottom.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1535-1:** Is this Hell? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Breen:** Not really.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interview Concluded**
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-1535-1 does not communicate afterward. SCP-1535-1 expires in 2 hours.//

//Researcher&#39;s Note: So far, all SCP-1535-1 entities claim to be deceased residents of Castilian Spain who lived between the years of 1500 and 1600.//
