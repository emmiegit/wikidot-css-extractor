Between 1919 and 1920, in the aftermath of World War I, SCP-6268 and their following, likewise-minded //sidhe// and similar fae subjects, managed to take control of [[span style=&#34;color:yellow&#34;]]Wilheim[[/span]], a massive aerial eigenweapon created by the German Empire between 1912 and 1917[[footnote]]The construction of [[span style=&#34;color:yellow&#34;]]Wilheim[[/span]] was mainly aided and supervised by the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/magierakademie-hub Magickademia Germanica], and was intended to function as a weather-manipulating mobile station, but, due to several installation errors, never saw actual deployment.[[/footnote]]. Under the order of SCP-6268, [[span style=&#34;color:yellow&#34;]]Wilheim[[/span]] was rebuilt as a floating city-state, operating as a self-proclaimed sanctuary for paranormal beings and human subjects affiliated with the anomalous. Following several disputes between SCP-6268, the government of West Germany, the Global Occult Coalition and the Foundation, [[span style=&#34;color:yellow&#34;]]Wilheim[[/span]] was officially recognized as an allied and independent geopolitical entity in 1977. ||

Following the successful liquidation of SCP-6268, the received corpse was delivered by GOI-22222 members (designated **AE-016** and **AE-017**) at **Site-54** in a specialized container.
@@ @@
According to **AE-016**, the remains of SCP-6268 were &#34;contaminated&#34;, and later examination via Foundation researchers revealed the presence of a noxious substance, causing rapid cellular death upon exposure.
@@ @@
Said substance has so far not been replicated or analyzed, and the corpse was transferred to a LEVEL 5 - Anomalous Item Security Container.
@@ @@
SCP-6268 was killed by seven shots: one to the head, one to the heart, two into the liver, one to the spleen, two to the kidneys. No ammunition remained.

Involved and participating personnel received total amnestic treatment.

Public knowledge about the truth of SCP-6268&#39;s assassination is, to date, not existent.
