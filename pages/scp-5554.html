**Item #:** SCP-5554

[[include component:image-block
| name=B
| caption=SCP-5554 as of 09/28/2019.]]

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation web crawler Delta-17 (&#34;ORANGEPEELER&#34;) is to continuously monitor the web for any Instagram accounts that have, or are suspected to have, visited SCP-5554&#39;s profile or interacted with any of its posts, and immediately delete them upon discovery. SCP-5554 has been blocked from accessing or allowing access to the general public.

//Update:// Following 09/25/2019, interaction using direct message has been proven successful. Researcher Oliver Crane is to message with SCP-5554 every day for the benefit of its mental health. For more information, see Addendum 2.

**Description:** SCP-5554 is an account under the name //&#34;Akihikoteddybear&#34;// on the social media platform //Instagram//. All attempts to trace devices using this account have failed. Any Instagram account that interacts with SCP-5554 in any way (i.e. visiting its profile, viewing its posts) will become an instance of SCP-5554-1.

[[include component:image-block
| name=A
| caption=An example of SCP-5554-1 interacting with SCP-5554.]]

SCP-5554-1 are Instagram accounts that, although they had previously been maintained by normal civilians, operate via anomalous means since contact with SCP-5554. SCP-5554-1 instances will only post about and interact with SCP-5554. Separate SCP-5554-1 instances appear to act in coordination, as all such accounts post identical content and comments at exactly the same times. It is unknown at this time if SCP-5554 affects the civilians behind SCP-5554-1 accounts.

**Addendum 1: SCP-5554 Posts**

Foreword: The following are all of SCP-5554&#39;s posts to date.

//Note- Researcher Crane programmed the Instagram account used to emulate the effects of a reality sink, leaving said account unaffected by SCP-5554’s anomalous properties, making communication possible.//

Closing statement: Daily communication with SCP-5554 is to continue until further notice.

//Further requests to reclassify this anomaly as Euclid are currently not being accepted. This is a sapient AI running on a server that we cannot physically locate, capable of turning any online platform into a party of praise, which would have only continued to expand if we had not interfered. I will not take chances on it suddenly getting bored of talking to Researcher Crane and anyone else who will be assigned to talk to it. -- Professor Marcus William Scott//
