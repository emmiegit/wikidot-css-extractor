**Special Containment Procedures:** Disinformation campaigns are currently ongoing to obscure the existence of SCP-MORE GUN from the general public. Foundation webcrawlers have been programmed to target publications and social media posts that might constitute events derived from SCP-MORE GUN.

**Description:** SCP-MORE GUN refers to an anomalous correlation between the magnitude of excessive and gratuitous firepower and the effectiveness of any action said firepower is applied to. While poorly understood for the most part, it is known that the presence of the following factors may lead to the occurrence of SCP-MORE GUN.
* An excessive amount of firearms[[footnote]] Defined as anything that shoots things really quickly. [[/footnote]] [[footnote]] Inclusive of a potato jammed into a vehicular exhaust pipe. [[/footnote]]
* An excessive variety of firearms [[footnote]] Ideally, no two firearms should be of identical make, but this appears to be overridden by increments in total number of firearms used. [[/footnote]]
* Customization[[footnote]] All customization requests must now be authorized by the Department of Task Forces following the ruling of //SCP Foundation v. Valve Corp.// [[/footnote]] of firearms present

SCP-MORE GUN was first discovered during an incident involving D-Class and armed MTF personnel, an experimental adiabatic bomb, several rolls of toilet paper, a leaf blower, and a breached SCP-████-J. Following amendments to SCP-████-J&#39;s containment procedures and several other unrelated incidents of similar nature, the Department of Other formally opened investigations into the anomaly to investigate the extent of its effects and to further understand its initiation process.

[[div class=&#34;darkdocument&#34;]]
= __**ADDENDUM MORE GUN.1:**__ Investigation by the Department of Other 
----
The initial phase of testing primarily focused on the initiation of SCP-MORE GUN for security and containment purposes. However, due to activities of such nature already requiring the use of a significant degree of firepower, SCP-MORE GUN occurrences were a rarity. Presently, SCP-MORE GUN is believed to be a fundamental property of firepower, exhibiting similarities to the Dunning-Kruger effect which are explored in the Moore-Gunn model. 


[[include component:image-block name=graph.png|width=100%|caption=SCP-MORE GUN explained via the Moore-Gunn model.]]

Under the Moore-Gunn model, it is assumed that all actions may be accomplished via the application of firepower, but there exists a certain boundary in the magnitude of firepower that will lead to a successful action. Failure to apply an appropriate amount of firepower for a given action will lead to its failure and potentially undesirable consequences, which is particularly apparent for excessive firepower application. 

However, should one greatly upscale the magnitude of firepower, SCP-MORE GUN is initiated, resulting in an unintended outcome many times more expedient or desirable than the original action.

**TARGET ACTION:** Preparation of a bowl of macaroni and cheese.

**ACTION TAKEN:** Constituent ingredients acquired from Site-19 pantry and placed on a wooden stool in testing area. 135 security and MTF personnel wielding a variety of firearms, ranging from handguns to grenade launchers, were instructed to fire at the wooden stool continuously for 10 minutes on a rotatory basis to compensate for reloading intervals. Experimental directed-energy weapons were temporarily requisitioned from Site-19&#39;s labs to provide additional firepower. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-big-egg-j SCP-Big egg] was also egged in for good measure.

**RESULTS:** ##lime|**SUCCESS.**## Upon the settling of the dust, 1 bowl of macaroni and cheese, paired with a fluffy omelet,[[footnote]] SCP-Big egg egged back to normal Big within the next 20 minutes.

**TARGET ACTION:** Derivation of the specific equation(s) that SCP-MORE GUN obeys.

**ACTION TAKEN:** A stockpile of arithmetic instruments and mathematics materials was assembled, included 58 graphing calculators, 4 graduate mathematics textbooks, and a computer hosting a copy of T-32MO.aic[[footnote]] Class-II Narrow Intelligence AI widely used for advanced calculation and general data analysis. [[/footnote]] and hundreds of other textbooks in PDF format. Test site continuously bombed via 20 B-52 Stratofortresses, 5 of which utilized napalm. 300 MTF personnel discharged assorted firearms in the direction of the build site, accompanied by 10 mounted directed-energy turrets. Operation supported by gunfire from SCPS Lagrange and SCPS Repulse.

**RESULTS:** ##red|**FAILURE.**## Computer managed to survive bombardment.

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-666-j Dr. Gerald] was instructed to pursue SCP-001-J from a modified 2019 Nissan Sentra, which was launched into flight via the Site-19 railgun. In addition to the 15 sentry turrets mounted to the roof and doors of the Nissan Sentra and 30 homing missiles locked on to SCP-001-J, Dr. Gerald&#39;s anomalous driving abilities were believed to be sufficient in initiating SCP-MORE GUN.

**TARGET ACTION:** Termination of SCP-173.

**ACTION TAKEN:** SCP-173 is moved to testing site and enclosed in a 150 meter radius monodirectional confinement sigil.[[footnote]] Temporarily permits the entry of &#34;out&#34; to &#34;in&#34;, but not conversely.

**RESULTS:** ##red|**FAILURE.**## SCP-173 remained completely intact and was recontained without issue. Foundation personnel embedded in seismological institutions successfully obfuscated the detonation of a nuclear device at the testing site, altering data to suggest that the detonation site was actually in North Korea. The unintentional willingness of the North Korean regime to declare responsibility for this designation has assisted in obfuscation efforts. Additionally, SCP-173 has not produced any excretions in over a month. This is believed to be an effect of SCP-MORE GUN, however further tests involving the termination of anomalies have been postponed indefinitely.
