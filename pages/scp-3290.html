**Item #:** SCP-3290

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation responses to different 3290-Events will depend on different circumstances. These include but are not limited to:

# Local community standing of the individual affected
# Global knowledge of the individual affected
# Social media outreach and influence
# Prior criminal charges and outcome of said charges
# Level of involvement in scientific research
# Believability of accounts given during 3290-Events

Foundation personnel working in law enforcement or child-care who are able to identify 3290-Events are to bring it to the attention of Disinformation specialists. Research is to be conducted in order to better predict the location and spread of SCP-3290 beyond the current rate of prediction analytics (42%~). Persons in a position of authority who are likely to be next affected by SCP-3290 are to be monitored in the case of a 3290-Event.

**Description:** SCP-3290 is a phenomenon involving a recurring dream that targets one individual at a time. Individuals affected by SCP-3290 experience nightmares in which they are attacked by leeches, mosquitoes, and other hematophagic[[footnote]]Blood-consuming.[[/footnote]] organisms, resulting in a loss of most of the body&#39;s moisture, and subsequent mummification of the individual experiencing the nightmare. Despite experiencing intense discomfort upon waking, individuals targeted by SCP-3290 do not have any physical symptoms related to massive blood loss experienced in the dream.

Nightmares will occur during slow-wave sleep (SWS). The exact nature and length of nightmares vary, although barring being disrupted from SWS, nightmares typically last for a minimum of an hour. During the time an individual is asleep, 3290-Events occur. During a 3290-Event, the target&#39;s social media will be updated with posts describing crimes of one or more of the following in a fragmented, stream-of-consciousness manner: 

* Child pornography possession
* Sexual assault of a minor
* Stalking a minor
* Murder of a minor
* Use of minors in scientific research[[footnote]][DATA EXPUNGED][[/footnote]]

The accuracy of these posts is estimated to be approximately 98%; furthermore, regardless of accuracy, all individuals questioned by law enforcement will admit to either committing a crime related to pedophilia or otherwise sexually fetishizing minors.

While it has been impossible to pinpoint the person next affected, in most instances, SCP-3290 will select its next target from a previous target&#39;s social media contacts, allowing for semi-consistent tracking. It is theorized that individuals with no social media accounts will not be targeted or are otherwise undetectable to the Foundation.
