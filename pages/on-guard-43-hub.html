Welcome to Site-43! We&#39;re different.

Looking for scary monsters in solid boxes? This place isn&#39;t for you. Looking to feed people into a meat grinder? You&#39;ll have better luck at Site-19. Looking for a relaxed backwater full of eccentric academics, and a chance to try out some crazier containment techniques? Come see what we get up to down below.

[[f&gt;image LHR2.png]]

There&#39;s a few things you need to know before you get settled in. First of all, have you got any reflective objects on your person? Anything made of glass, or clear plastic? We&#39;re gonna have to confiscate those. No, they should have told you before you arrived. See, there&#39;s a mirror monster loose in the compound, and the best part is, that&#39;s intentional.

It might take you some time to get used to this place. Why not ride the Inter-Sectional Subway System and check out Intake Point Nine-Four, in the middle of Lake Huron? It&#39;s all glassed-in, and it&#39;s quite a view. Maybe you&#39;ll spot one of the underwater panthers that are loose on the lakebed! That&#39;s also intentional.

We handle containment differently at Site-43. We have to, because we can&#39;t actually take on more super-dangerous anomalies. We&#39;ve still got quite a few, but they&#39;re the ones we can&#39;t move. After the annual magic gunk refinery explosions started happening, we...

Hey! Where are you going?
[[div]]
----

I&#39;m glad you decided to stay. I have some stories to tell you about this place, and the people who work here, and the people who don&#39;t work here anymore. We keep a lot of secrets down here in the dark.

Right now, there&#39;s two things dominating most of our time. On the one hand, we&#39;re fighting a shadow war with an ancient Austrian memeticist society (no, seriously). On the other hand, we&#39;re trying to catch a less-ancient American memeticist corporation (yes, seriously). Of course there&#39;s a lot more than that going on; it&#39;s a big, weird Site. Maybe you&#39;ll bring us some new stories. Maybe they won&#39;t even be about memes. Please, let them not be about memes.

On Guard 43 is a canon centred around Site-43 in Ontario, Canada. It began as one set of interlinked tales and SCPs, but has since branched out to become more of a general //setting.// There are now three distinct &#34;series&#34; being written in On Guard 43:

* **Words of Power and Poison**, [[*user HarryBlank]]&#39;s stories about Site-43&#39;s struggles against implacable, immemorial meme-wielding enemies;
* **Vikander-Kneed Technical Media**, chronicling the antics of a terrifying, dangerous, and often darkly hilarious memetic media corporation created by [[*user Grigori Karpin]];
* **Archetypicals**, [[*user Placeholder McD]]&#39;s prestige drama about secondary characters answering a call to adventure from deep in interstellar/narrative space.

Want to write for this canon? You don&#39;t have to use the established characters -- but you can! You don&#39;t have to contribute to existing storylines -- but you can! (Except Archetypicals, that&#39;s self-contained.) You don&#39;t even need to write about Site-43 itself -- though you can -- as long as you&#39;re using some of the elements outlined in the next tab. You should think of this place as a set of storytelling tools. We&#39;ve got a detailed, well-defined Site, a big ol&#39; cast you can bend to your whims, and a generalized Canadian-ness that should satisfy your entirely inappropriate need to, say, create an actual Canadian branch.

This is a canon about real people in absurd situations. Click onward if that appeals to you at all.

**SCP Foundation Lake Huron Research and Containment Site-43** is the long name of the largest Foundation facility in Canada. Site-43 has three specialities: the abatement of toxic materials generated by anomalous subjects in containment; the discovery of anomalous subjects attested in the historical record but not yet contained; and the preservation of consensus normalcy in the face of persistent memetic attacks from several distinct Groups of Interest.
[[f&gt;image AAFC.jpg]]
Canada is a Foundation backwater, so Site-43 is set up differently from most other R&amp;C facilities. Personnel are organized into pseudoacademic Sections and encouraged to engage in long-term collaborative research projects. Containment procedures are more creative than the norm; the intensity of supernatural activity in the Great Lakes region makes putting everything in boxes impractical, so more esoteric solutions are devised. Containment breaches are rare, D-class are nonexistent, and the sense of camaraderie is strong. People live at 43, and they don&#39;t all hate it.

One major focus of research is the ancient Austrian secret societies known as the //schriftsteller// and //giftschreiber//, memeticists focused on upholding or undermining the cause of universal order. For reasons as yet unknown, the //giftschreiber// have been conducting a sustained campaign against the Canadian government and Site-43 since the late 1960s. A good primer article is [[[SCP-5054-EX]]].

Site-43 is also the centre of containment efforts for GoI-5889, Vikander-Kneed Technical Media. Absolutely nothing is known about the origins or motivations of this group, but their effect on the wider American media landscape is all too clear. VKTM produces media which drives people insane, picks away at their insecurities, pokes fun at their failings, and generally unsettles people to unclear ends. What&#39;s more, they seem all too aware that 43 is on their case. A good primer article is [[[SCP-5889]]].

**Time Periods:** There are three main time periods covered by this canon, roughly defined:
* The Past -- From the introduction of the //giftschreiber// in the seventeenth century, through the foundation of Provisional Site-43 in the 1940s, to the retirement and death of its first director in 1997;
* The Present -- From the 1990s, when the present main cast began working at 43, to a floating period one or two years from our real-world moment;
* The Future -- the 2030s, wherein Archetypicals takes place.

**Crossovers** -- On Guard 43 considers every canon that doesn&#39;t contradict most other canons to be... canon. If it doesn&#39;t shoot the setting into space, or break the Veil with kaiju, or say the Foundation never existed, it probably happened. That doesn&#39;t mean On Guard 43 exists in all those other universes; it doesn&#39;t need to work both ways. Crossing over with other canons is encouraged! 

S&amp;C Plastics in particular is a great fit. In fact, S&amp;C Plastics is hard canon for On Guard 43. If you don&#39;t like Site-87, Site-43 probably isn&#39;t going to be for you.

Elements of Resurrection are hard canon. ETTRA, introduced in the [[[resurrection-old-foes-hub|Old Foes]]] splinter, is a major component of Words of Power and Poison. As the [[[resurrection-new-faces-hub|New Faces]]] splinter is hard canon to Old Foes, the whole kit and caboodle definitely happened in the context of On Guard 43.

[[[aiad-homescreen|AIAD]]], by virtue of the Limited Memory series which features Placeholder McDoctorate, is also hard canon.

Want to write something for this canon? It&#39;s easy. It&#39;s so easy, even Harry can do it. There&#39;s two different approaches you can take:

* Read up a little on the first two series listed (Words of Power and Poison, and Vikander-Kneed Technical Media) and see if you think you&#39;d like to contribute to them;
* Do zero research and just ask an existing writer how your interests might fit in;
* Get a sense of the place, come up with your own standalone thing, and write that instead.

You don&#39;t need to add to some over-arching narrative to write for this canon. Maybe set something at 43, definitely vibrate on some of the same frequencies as the existing material, and you&#39;re good. If you do want to contribute to the two open series, though, there&#39;s a few things to keep in mind:

* If you think you might be writing something that&#39;ll step on someone else&#39;s --toys-- toes, try talking it over with them first;
* Don&#39;t write origin stories for other people&#39;s toys;
* Don&#39;t break other people&#39;s toys without asking.

Harry would love to see anything you wanna write about Site-43. If it doesn&#39;t impinge on his so-called storyline, though, feel free to ignore the fuck out of him.

Grigori would love to see anything you wanna write about VKTM. //Grigori would love to see anything you wanna write about VKTM.//

Placeholder&#39;s series //is Placeholder&#39;s series.// The man has plans. If you would like to write something relating to the Archetypicals Division (for example, naming and employing them in the containment of a metanarrative anomaly), contact Placeholder McD via wikidot pm. We may be able to work something out.

If you want to add something you wrote to the hub, use the following code:

[[code]]
[[div class=&#34;bubble&#34;]]
++ **[[[SCP-XXXX]]]: The Series Title**

A description! Hopefully one that either fits on one line, or fits //well// on two. 
If you fuck that up, Harry&#39;s probably going to rewrite it on you. 
He&#39;s probably not gonna ask nicely. He&#39;s like that, I&#39;m afraid.
[[/div]]
[[/code]]

If you&#39;re not sure what you&#39;ve come up with fits into the existing series... good! Add it under &#34;Canadian Cont(ainm)ent.&#34; That&#39;s where non-series stuff goes. If you end up writing a whole damn //thing// eventually, we&#39;ll give you your own spiffy collapsible and banner. We&#39;re nice hosts like that.

Bug Harry when you post something and he&#39;ll do you up a little icon like the other entries have. He works fast.

[[/=]]
**Tone** -- On Guard 43 is neither grimdark nor lolFoundation. You can be gross and scary and upsetting and emotional, and you can be light and airy and absurd, but don&#39;t carry either one to the point of cartoonishness. Everything on here so far has an element of humour to it, but try to remember that these are supposed to be real people. Nobody walks around Site-43 with a shotgun, and nobody at Site-43 feeds human beings into a meat grinder.

**Topics** -- On Guard 43 is focused on a Site that does several things differently from the larger Foundation. These include:

* Site-43 has a set of squabbling pseudoacademic Sections instead of departments. Its staff is more likely to be eccentric, more likely to be writing research papers, more likely to be pulling faces behind each others&#39; backs. Academics are both more and much less adult than non-academics;
* Site-43 does historical research. The researchers in the Archives and Revision Section comb through old documents, looking for anomalies that weren&#39;t recognized as such at the time. You want to tell a long-form story about an evolving problem? You want to tell a short-form story about something that happened in the past? We&#39;re a ready-made framing narrative for you;
* Site-43 does acroamatic abatement. That&#39;s the breaking-down of gunk produced by our various subjects in containment. That leaves lots of room for stories about anomalous toxicity, day-to-day working class drudgery, and bonkers disasters;
* Site-43 has a ton of different Sections doing different stuff. Check out the list on the [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-43|Site dossier]]] and see if anything sparks some ideas;
* Site-43 is targeted by, and is targeting, various Groups of Interest with their fingers in memetic pies. The //giftschreiber// destabilize order with creative memetic attacks, the //schriftsteller// try to stabilize society with memetic effects, and Vikander-Kneed is trying to fuck people up with memetic media. You don&#39;t need a lot of background to play around with those premises;
* Site-43 is a Foundation backwater. People live much more normal lives here than they do at Site-19. Slice-of-life is very, very welcome in this canon;
* Site-43 is one of the headquarters of the Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority (ETTRA). That means we spend some time thinking about how we might use our anomalies to combat hostile GOI action. You can too;
* Site-43 is surrounded by a Nexus of First Nations reservations. If you&#39;re First Nations yourself, please by all means write about that! If you&#39;re not, //please don&#39;t;//
* Site-43 is in Canada. You are allowed to write about Canadian shit. Sorry about that, everybody else.
