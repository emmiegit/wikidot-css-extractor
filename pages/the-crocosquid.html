||~ Status||In Reserve||
||~ Demand||None||
||~ Reserve|| $USD 10,000,000 ||
||~ Availability||Unique||
||~ Identifier||The Crocosquid||
||~ Description||The wholesale corpse of the Colossal Aquamorph Entity which attacked the Fey isle of Hy-Brasil in 1988. Entity is a unique paranormal entity, measuring approximately 100 meters in length, and possessing of a number of magical traits and abilities. The most notable of these include superb regenerative capabilities, as well as intense fire-breathing. _
 _
Item is sold as a single lot to any interested buyer. Although the entity is currently deceased, any number of uses for the genetics, parts or mystical aura could be envisioned. Marshall, Carter and Dark leaves the ultimate decision of what to with the corpse to the eventual buyer.||

||||||||~ OCN39/87YUI/O9NH6||
||~ Sender|| Ottaviano de&#39; Medici||~ Recipient|| MC&amp;D All Distribution||
||||||||Marshall, Carter and Dark is esteemed to announce the recent acquisition of the corpse of the entity which attacked the island of Hy-Brasil, colloquially called the crocosquid. Although the attack on the island has significantly impacted business operations on the island, we are sure that the recent acquisition can be used to at least partially make up for the financial loss of product, as well as the likely removal of a key market base. We would also like to take a moment to honor the lives of those who died in the attack. _
 _
The direct acquisition of property by Marshall, Carter and Dark is unusual, compared to the traditional client consignment basis that we typically operate upon. However, we were given the deal of a lifetime, and were one of the few parties able to take the offer. Rather than sell the corpse to us, King Delbáeth II offered us the corpse for free, as long as we paid for the expenses of removing the object from Hy-Brasil. Obviously, few other agencies had the resources to partake in such an offer, and we had to act fast before the Foundation was given the offer. _
 _
Given the nature of the acquisition and the expense we are currently undergoing to store it (keeping a beast of that size from rotting is something of a difficult task), we are opening this matter up to all MC&amp;D staff members. If you have established clients with the means to potentially purchase the organism, please make sure to mention the recent acquisition to them, or to otherwise direct their attention to the item. _
 _
Make sure to stress the potency of the item for ritual, alchemical, or other magical purposes. Shy away from mentioning the potential for the item to be [[[grant-request-for-mechacrocosquid|revived]]], as this could lead regulatory agencies such as the Global Occult Coalition to take drastic measures against the firm. This is, obviously, to be avoided at all costs. _
 _
Marshall, Carter and Dark thanks you for time, and looks forward to the exciting solutions we will come to soon!||

||||||||~ Memo 02||
||||||||~ OCN39/87YUI/O9NH6||
||~ Sender|| Emma Strave||~ Recipient|| Ottaviano de&#39; Medici||
|||||||| Hi Ottaviano, _
 _
Client Services just got a call from an individual interested in the acquisition of &#34;the crocosquid&#34; (Lot OCN39/87YUI/O9NH6). You are listed as the primary point of contact for the lot, although it seems like the file may not have been recently updated (the last listed update was in 1991?). I did check inventory, and it seems like the lot is still in storage at the Three Portlands Darkport. Regardless, the client was very interested in the lot and requested I do everything I could to get her in contact with a specialist. _
 _
The client left her name as &#34;Queen Mab&#34; and did not provide any contact information. She did say, however, that she was definitely in the MC&amp;D client system, even if (and I quote) &#34;You need to go through Dark&#39;s personal address book.&#34; Given her apparent familiarity with Dark, I am passing the call on despite the lack of further information. She said that she was calling from a pay-phone and would not be reachable at that number later. _
 _
The client specifically requested to outright purchase the lot, and wanted to book a tour of the storage facilities for the lot. She is interested in seeing the lot, as well as getting the condition reports and any other documentation we are able to provide at this time. _
 _
Best! _

|||||||| Hi Emma, _
 _
Unfortunately, Ottaviano is no longer with Marshall, Carter and Dark. He was recently apprehended by the Foundation after a drunk driving incident, but we expect to see him again relatively soon, within the next two decades. He was one of the best of the Acquisitions Department. In the meantime, I am covering his portfolio. _
 _
Mab&#39;s request cannot be completed for two reasons: _
 _
**1)** MC&amp;D was unable to find a buyer for Lot OCN39/87YUI/O9NH6 after three years. Given the incredibly expensive storage requirements of the corpse, we took a page from our handling of her [[[kaiju-caviar-ocn39-t5fg6-7hjl2|eggs]]], and decide to sell the corpse piecemeal. After a special auction in 1995, we were able to sell off 90% of the beast. The file for OCN39/87YUI/O9NH6 should have reflected this, but it seems that our 2011 database transfer cleared the special notes field that formerly indicated this. I&#39;ve gone into the system and restored that note. _
 _
Currently, all that remains of OCN39/87YUI/O9NH6 is the skull, a few flesh samples, and approximately a third of the initial supply of caviar. Nothing that Mab would be interested in, even if we still had the desire to sell it. Percival Darke treated those items as an internal purchase, and Iris has chosen to continue that. I believe the skull has been used to decorate the DEATH PYRAMID in the past. _
 _
**2)** Mab has been banned from bidding at MC&amp;D since its establishment 200 years ago. This ban was personally implemented by the elder Darke, and is not to be cleared under any circumstances. If you are unfamiliar with Queen Mab (it sounds like it), she is a primordial faerie queen of darkness who formerly ruled the world as a genocidal tyrant. _
 _
If I had to guess, her interest in the corpse is related to the reestablishment of her kingdom -- a goal that would damage MC&amp;D business interests. _
 _
Thank you for the update. I&#39;ll send an update to Iris Dark. Do not attempt to contact the client. _
 _
Thanks, _
Jonah _
 _
PS -- Did she say anything about how she might pay for the item? I can&#39;t imagine that Mab has a single penny to her name these days.||

||||||||~ OCN39/87YUI/O9NH6||
||~ Sender|| Jonah Blackwell||~ Recipient||Iris Dark||
|||||||| Hello ma&#39;am, _
 _
My sincerest apologies regarding the recent break-in at the Three Portlands Darkport. Security had been raised in response to the recent call from Queen Mab, as you requested, but she managed to infiltrate the space and locate the crocosquid&#39;s corpse regardless. Please be assured that we are confident that she was only able to sneak in -- she would not have been able to leave with the inventory. _
 _
We are as of yet unsure the exact timeline of her infiltration, or how she managed to find the correct storage warehouse. We believe that this was due to a sympathetic magic bond between Mab and the crocosquid, but cannot confirm this. According to the books you sent, after Mab and crocosquid had fought together, they swore a blood oath together, which persisted past death. This is only tentative. _
 _
Mab&#39;s intrusion was noticed not long after she entered the storage locker, when loud sobbing was heard by several security personnel. She was physically in the body of a minor anartist, named Felicity Baudin. Mab was discovered embracing the skull of the creature, crawling over it. As requested, I have personally transcribed all of her audible and intelligible remarks: _
 _
• //&#34;Nessilatha, whatever did they do to you?&#34;// _
• //&#34;You&#39;re not the mortal one, Nessie. You&#39;re the one who brings me back. I can&#39;t do the same to you. Not like this.&#34;// _
• //&#34; I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever see you dead, you know.&#34;// _
• //&#34;How will we raise up hell like we used to, Nessilatha? How will we shake the heavens now?&#34;// _
• //&#34;I guess this is the end. I don&#39;t have much time left in this body. That&#39;s why I came to see you. Try to bring the empire back. You were my best, my finest general. If anyone could have helped...//&#34; _
 _
After the last statement, security personnel entered the room. At this point, Mab immediately turned to run. She was, unfortunately, able to exit through a similar method to how she initially entered. Security informs me they are rather confident that only Mab could have entered/exited through the means she did, but are working to patch it to prevent future intrusion. _
 _
It is my understanding that [[[hell-hath-no-fury-like-a-woman-scorned|Carter already has a bounty]]] out for Mab after the little stunt at the race track. That makes things easier for us: no need to get personally involved. _
 _
Unless Carter fucks up, which is of course, extremely likely.||
