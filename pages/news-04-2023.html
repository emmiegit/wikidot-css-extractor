+ Interview with AssertiveRoland, creator of the Daeva
[[/=]]

When I was reading [[[SCP-7291]]] by [[*user HarryBlank]], a familiar name popped up: the Daevites. I‚Äôve always loved the Daevites, but I realized I didn‚Äôt actually know much about their on-site history and origin, so I spoke to the man who would know the most about the Daevites.

Would you like to introduce yourself?

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
Hi. I&#39;m AssertiveRoland, occasionally of the SCP Wiki. I&#39;ve been an on-and-off contributor over the years.
[[/div]]

What would you say is your most famous article? Or the one that caused the most ‚Äúripples?‚Äù

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
Well, actually, I think it&#39;s 141 - no, I think we all know why I&#39;m being interviewed, it&#39;s [[[SCP-140]]].
Which has always been something of an appealing surprise to me, I certainly wasn&#39;t expecting anything close to the ripples spawned from this particular one.
[[/div]]

Would you like to give a quick summary of the SCP?

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

Certainly.

SCP-140 is a modern hardcopy book of anomalous length produced at some time during the 20th century that recounts the history of an anomalous ancient central Asian civilization known as the Daevites. The Daevites performed various typical-for-the-era practices such as ancestor worship, slavery, conquest, gruesome sacrifice, and militarism - and seemingly performed efficacious acts of religious ritual magic.

For some reason, if it comes into contact with any ink suitable for writing including human blood, the book&#39;s account - which is highly detailed and seems closer to a biography than a secondary source - extends. At the same time, historical evidence of the civilization in question is extended further into the record, effectively prolonging its apparent existence and leaving new relics in archaeological sites and other remnants.

As such ,if the civilization is permitted to continue expanding past its original destruction, eventually it will get closer and closer to the modern era, leaving more relics and even survivor populations or descended cultures with a greater presence in the modern world. The SCP is apparently the product of a specific anomalous individual and was produced by a vanity press, so a small but noteworthy number of other copies exist other than that in Foundation custody.

Crucially, the SCP does not appear to have any memetic component to it; people are not compelled to add to the record, and yet expansion events continue to occur.

This feels very strange, incidentally, to summarize this way. üôÇ

Will that do for a summary?
[[/div]]

Of course. Now, do you remember any articles similar to SCP-140 when you originally published it?

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

At the time, I don&#39;t believe it was very typical. The Wiki at that point had a significant bias towards a mixture of what one might call &#34;urban legend&#34; SCPs, basically just &#34;wow, that&#39;s a weird modern object that does something inexplicable!&#34; and the *hard* sciences rather than the soft sciences. There had been a few historical SCPs, but I feel there was a general bias against either any sort of &#34;mythology&#34; or any sort of direct ties to real-world or ancient cultures.
[[/div]]

What about other GOIs at the time? Were any developed or developing?

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

There were Groups of Interest at the time, but I wouldn&#39;t say there was as much of a sense of a //mythos// that modern Foundation audiences would expect. The Church of the Broken God - that was the big name at the time for them, it wasn&#39;t &#34;Mekhanites&#34;, and they were very pointedly more of a modern abberration as I recall - and the Chaos Insurgency and the Factory were more typical of GOIs at the time. Heck, there were two who were just //individuals//, one &#34;Nobody&#34; and somebody who was basically just a supervillain.
At the time there was a pretty strong feel, I think, that the Foundation and its researchers were sort of the stars of the show, and there was also a very strong bias against the notion of &#34;canons.&#34;
It was all very X-Files - &#34;that&#39;s weird&#34; more than anything else, with the GOI groups necessary to act as sort of black ops opposition to the Foundation when needed.

[[/div]]

Now, and this is very much a personal question, when should Daevite be used instead of Daeva, and vice versa? Essentially, what is the difference of Daeva vs. Daevite.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

Ahh, now we&#39;re getting into the details, heh.

So first off, usual disclaimer. This is Just Me, The Guy Who Lit the Spark and Has Ideas at the moment, I&#39;m not speaking on high from my throne in Daevavaon. But!

&#34;Daevite&#34; is the //polity//, it&#39;s the empire and its culture. //Daeva// is the specific ruling caste/potentially human subspecies that rules that empire, but also the //people//, the demographic, who maintained and ruled the Daevite empire.
To put it another way, the daeva were a particular ruling tribe/caste, culture and people who reigned over the daevite empire; although it&#39;s convenient to conflate the two it&#39;s not exactly 1:1 - as we can obviously see from their offshoot groups.
(And h.sapiens daeva is, by Foundation modern reckoning, a //subspecies//, but the daeva themselves precede the notion of such things and that&#39;s a reflection of their particular worldview.)
[[/div]]

How do you feel about the spread of the Daeva? Today, it‚Äôs one of the most popular GOIs, having its own canon and the framework of an original language.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

It&#39;s honestly extremely hard to wrap my head around and tremendously flattering. It&#39;s a cliche to say things like &#34;oh I&#39;d love nothing more than for people to do stuff with my work,&#34; but in this case it is very honest. I never dreamed of any impact like this and it&#39;s something I occasionally come back to and marvel that it had such an impact.

And the thing is that so much of it is the product of the community. The matriarchy? The horitcultural/fertility thing? The elaborate Sarkic mythos and its connections? None of that stuff was even remotely in my mind when I first set it down.

I honestly set out just to do a history-focused SCP because at the time I felt it wasn&#39;t a huge presence in the community, and I thought &#34;hey, what if one of those ancient cultures of antiquity actually had sacrificial rituals that //worked//, and all their ancient mores and attitudes were being brought artificially towards the present? How upsetting, how challenging, would that be? How much of what we see as barbarism was //typical// in its day?&#34;

So to have the Daeva have become practically one of the precursors of the entire Foundation-verse, to have had them roped into the amazingly compelling Nalka/Mekhane conflict that forms a huge part of the backbone of the modern site&#39;s mythos - it&#39;s unbelievable. I&#39;m constantly in awe, and I&#39;m so often inspired by some of the amazing things so many creative people have done with it.

I mean it has a //conlang//, for crying out loud. A brilliant person is making a daevite //conlang//. People have extrapolated so much out of this one work that I remember idly filling out on my off hours at my first job. It&#39;s unreal and I&#39;m forever grateful it struck a chord with so many people.

And when I do go and experiment with daeva stuff or draw on it, I know that everything I&#39;m inspired to do is in turn the collaboration with so many remarkably imaginative people.
I know that&#39;s probably repetitive
[[/div]]

As we close, is there anything else you‚Äôd like to say?

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

Honestly, I think what I&#39;d like to say most of all is just: &#34;Thank you.&#34; Thank you to everyone for whom this has struck a chord in their imaginations, and thank you for enriching my own work with your own efforts.

I am tremendously grateful that I could be of aid here, and I look forward to learning more about the Daevites //and// their daeva, in all the manifold permutations and historical variations and divergences from a single core source, together.

I&#39;m actually extremely interested in some of what I&#39;ve seen done in terms of trying to add complexity to the Daeva and daevites in terms of taking them from just an object of evil and fear to a complex anomalous society in their own right. It&#39;s been one of my pervasive own ambitions with the canon, so to speak, and I absolutely love to see what people do with it beyond the initial //just// object of fear, because I think the core of the idea is fully capable of supporting that addition to the mythos.
[[/div]]

Thank you for your time!

And there you have it folks! An interview with the creator of the Daevites! I hope this inspires you to give some Daeva articles some love! Cheers!
