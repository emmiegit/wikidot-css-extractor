**THE RECOLLECTIONS OF J. WHITE- CONTRABAND-MAN!**

**RECLAIMED FROM THE GHASTLY CLUTCHES OF THE SPINSTER-QUEEN!**

**PRINTED NOW, FOR A LIMITED TIME ONLY, IN THE NEW NEW ORLEANS TORCH**
[[/div]] 

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
DEAR READER: 

March the 22nd–

It has been two days since I left behind the flickering electric glow of New New Orleans. I am now on a steamer bound for New Natchez. It will be a week or more until we arrive, and I do not hope to be aboard when we do. 

My aim is to disembark at a truly wretched section of the river, and return with a mighty haul of contraband literature. Upon my return to New New Orleans, I shall be paid handsomely for this bounty. I plan, perhaps, to thereafter buy a new rifle from Schuyler and Sons; or even improve the dismal state of my current lodgings.

At the moment, however, all that I am confronted with is the hot, balmy air of the river’s southern reaches. Yellow-faced men and women peer out from log shanties and crude plank-homes as the steamer passes by. Beyond them, empty acreage spreads out for miles and miles; it was cleared centuries ago, and now lays fallow. Those that live here do not have the will to cultivate more than what is absolutely necessary for bare survival. 

The swampy atmosphere corrodes their character, I suspect. Were the wilderness not cleared from the land beyond the banks, I do not doubt that they would provide fertile targets for the Spinster-Queen.

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
March the 23rd– 

I have passed the great skeleton of Baton Rouge. A collection of savages, their faces covered with many scars, whooped at us upon our approach. They held aloft their grisly collections of jaw-bones, and made a great show of embarking upon their rafts; taunting the utterly terrified mud clerk [[footnote]] Mud clerks being general-purpose manual laborers on a steamer, for those unacquainted with the parlance of the river. [[/footnote]] who had been assigned the rifle that afternoon all the while.

One must not be too harsh on them. They simply do not know any better.
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
March the 24th– 

There was a large racket on deck today. The pilot felt his honor had been wronged by an impudent suggestion of the captain, and refused to steer the ship at anything more than half-speed until the captain garnished his wages by 25 specie. At this idea, the captain flew into a howling rage: for, you see, the pilot was apparently already quite well-paid on the order of two-hundred and twenty-five specie a month. If he wished for his wages to be denominated in Orleans dollars, yes, the captain could accommodate- but in specie there would be no resolution.

 Although I was, at this point, shied away from the bridge- for the first officer had the presence of mind to realize that, should an insurance dispute result from this, witnesses such as I would be most unhelpful- the fair few jolts I encountered over the next stretch of river told me more than enough about the resolution reached. 
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
March the 25th– 

Fort Plainwater! A most squalid place- but the last outpost of order I will see before entering the vast and unbound wilderness that lies ahead of New Natchez. A few savages attempted to hawk various protective talismans from their rafts as we landed. My rifle’s battered state convinced them that there would be little benefit in attempting to sell to me, and they spent their time pursuing easier marks. [[footnote]] I am not convinced of Dr. Betjeman’s claims that, in their backwards lifestyle, they have developed some method of conferring immunity to the dogma of the Spinster-Queen. My explanation is rather more simple: one must have a certain level of intelligence to be susceptible to her credo, and they all fall well below it. [[/footnote]]

I stocked up on cartridges while I still had the chance. Compared to Orleans prices, they are exorbitant in cost- but I did not want to run the risk of fouling them in the hot bayou air on the journey upstream. Now that we are in cooler climes, it should not be a concern.
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
March the 26th– 

We are well north of Fort Plainwater. Vast and mighty trees crowd both banks of the river, here. Tiny cabins peek out from the gaps in-between the two; dilapidated rafts and small canoes bob near ramshackle docks below. 

I wait, only, now, for a signal. A sign that these lands are truly under Her spell- and then I shall depart for shore. 

My rifle hangs heavy on my shoulder. 

Then- a small figure, departing from their cabin. A pile of tracts beneath their shoulder, they eagerly stumble down the bank and into a leaky canoe. They paddle rapidly towards the steamer, grinning wildly all the while.

“The word of the Spinste’ Queen! Good sirs! The word of the Spinste’ Queen!” The words dribble out of his mouth. An over-eager convert, it seems. He is a young man, in worn burlap clothes; his face tanned and riven by years of hard labor. 

I shoulder my rifle, and take aim. 

He recognizes the threat- but remains unbowed. “Oh, that won’t do much. She ‘tects us, y’know.” His canoe nearly collides with the steamer.

“There is a bounty on the tracts you carry. Hand them over, and you shall be unharmed.” Hoping to intimidate him, I make a show of laying my finger on the trigger.

“Oh, sir, but I can’t be giving these to the likes of you.” His once-effervescent grin fades. “She don’t want Her word destroyed. But if there are any other of you up on the decks who be in interest, I am glad to provide!”

I glance around at the other passengers on deck. Most have retreated indoors. A few still hang around, but they are only intent on observing the spectacle of our confrontation. The word of this madman does not intrigue them.

His canoe bobs almost directly below me. From the deck of the steamer, it is a jump of approximately seven feet. Holding my rifle high above my head- as to not let the water in- I vault over the railing, haphazardly aiming my feet towards the rough bow of the canoe. The canoe-man, experiencing a great deal of surprise at this maneuver, attempts to paddle away from the steamer- but it is no use. My feet plant themselves firmly on his small craft- the impact nearly capsizing it.

He holds on to the edges of the hull for dear life.

“S-sir!” 

I bring my rifle to my shoulder- and once more, aim at him. 

“Git.”

He does not need a further command. He deposits the tracts in an unkempt pile in the center of the canoe- the small puddle of water brought in by my leap already soaking the bottom tier- and jumps, headfirst, into the river, paddling with great speed and rapidity to the nearest shore. 


The steamer is a good fifty feet ahead of me, now. A small crowd has watched these events unfold from the rear deck, and is now waving me goodbye. There is no way the ship will stop in such waters. For the remainder of this expedition, I shall be living off the land.

The canoe-man scrambles onto the shore, and sprints up onto the bank- vanishing into the woods moments later. His craft, I assume, is now forfeit. 


Soon, the steamer vanishes in the distance- and all is quiet, but for the faint sound of the wild, and the river’s endless song.

[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]


I am no stranger to such wild and lawless sections of the river. Society along it has always been a string of pearls- faint outposts of civilization joined together by the most ruthless and unforgiving cord. 

Years ago, there were much worse things than wild lunatics among these distant reaches. Much worse.

I have hitched my canoe to a partially decayed log jutting out from the far bank of the river- somewhat downstream from where I first disembarked. Staying in one place for too long in such lands can be lethal, especially when I have alerted those here of my presence- and intentions. Her devotees have little inclination to wait.

With luck, I will need not stay here more than a night. But that is reliant on my discovery of suitable quantities of contraband. 

I disembark from my canoe, rifle slung over my shoulder- and begin walking along the bank, in search of faint and fickle civilization.

[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
 [[# Anchor2]]
    
    Out of a tall stand of conifers peers a small, ramshackle cabin- the first I have seen since my encounter with the canoe-man. I have not been walking long; ten minutes, at most. A povertous garden sits outside; a muddy track down the bank, formed by extensive use, leads to a makeshift pier.

    Smoke pours from the chimney. I ready my rifle, and slowly approach the door. 

Feigning innocence, I knock twice- and announce my presence. 

“Anybody home?”

From within, a clattering of furniture. And then, a harried, panicked reply:

“Git! Git! I don’t want- I don’t want none of it, y’hear? Cast off!”

A great stroke of fortune! This house does not appear, as of yet, to have been consumed by the Spinster-Queen.

Lowering my rifle, I attempt to calm the voice within.

“I’m here to collect contraband! I’m not with them. You have nothing to fear from me.”

The voice approaches the door. A single, scrutinizing eye peers at me from a crack within the frame. 


“And how’s I supposed to know that?”

I spread my arms open, holding my rifle one-handed.

“I have a canoe half-full of it. Should you like, I can show you. I have no truck with them.”

The door swings open. Behind it, stands a wizened woman of middle age; her face worn and bent from years on the frontier. In her hands stands a makeshift club, cobbled together from branches, twine, and a handful of rusty nails.

For a moment, we stand in silent consideration- both eying and sizing up the other. 

Then- she remits. 

&#34;Aw, hell- ain&#39;t nobody around here can afford a rifle anyway. Come on in.&#34;

She beckons me inside. The interior of her home is cold, and poorly-furnished; little adorns it but a small stove and a ramshackle table. She does, however, appear to have a separate bedroom- a luxury for these regions. 

&#34;Please,&#34; she says, laying out two bowls of an unidentified gruel on the table, &#34;sit. I haven&#39;t had much chance to talk to anyone who ain&#39;t spinster-folk lately.&#34; 

I am surprised she is not one herself. &#34;Do they not bother you?&#34; 

&#34;Well, they try- but they don&#39;t figure me an important target. She don&#39;t like widows much.&#34; There is, momentarily, a melancholy glint in her eyes.

&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I say, kneeling in front of the table.

&#34;Aww- don&#39;t be. He wasn&#39;t worth much anyway. Got himself killed in some foolhardy duel over nothin&#39;.&#34; 

There is an antique, jet-black pistol on her wall- unloaded. Her eyes flit towards it, momentarily.

&#34;Anyways!&#34; Her eyes return, with renewed vigor, to me. &#34;Eat. You must have gone through an awful lot, gettin&#39; here.&#34; 

The gruel does not taste like much, but it is the gesture that matters. She slurps it down vigorously. 

After a short silence, she inquires: “So- I assume you will not be staying here long?”

“A night, at most. I aim for this to be a fast trip. Of course, I have not yet found a place of lodging…” My request is implicit.

“Please, please- let me host you.” Her expression is genuine as she says this. The frontier breeds a humanity in these people that I have not entirely witnessed elsewhere.

“If I would not be a burden…”

She lays a hand upon my shoulder. 

“It is th’ least I could do. Please- let me take your coat.”

She begins to stand up- but I raise a hand to countermand her.

“I have work, still, today,” I say, gripping my rifle to reinforce my point. “But I appreciate your gracious offer of charity. I trust it will remain, should I return later?” I begin to, myself, stand.

“I do ask,” she says, evident concern upon her face- “do not lead them here. They tolerate me, at present- but I fear this tolerance will slip should they discover that I have betrayed them such.”

I look to her, with a gaze that I hope reassures. “Worry not, miss. There’ll be none to follow me back.”

[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
I spotted them, first, by the gathering of rafts and canoes. They hung by a dismal pier, a good walk down the river. I could not see the homes behind them- but the well-trodden nature of the bank above it informed me of their density.

A pile of the very same tracts I had been hunting sat upon the pier. I counted eight boats. 

There was, doubtlessly, a great gathering of them beyond the bank. This would require an approach beyond mere brute force.

[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
I stride, loudly, into a gathering of ramshackle huts and cabins, not bothering to hide my approach. A faint mist hangs overhead. Trees, tall and leafy, surround this enclosure. One could charitably describe the atmosphere of the scene as medieval- hostile, with brutal and savage undertones.

A collection of Her devotees- some armed- idle about in the muddy clearing that has formed in the center of the huts. Some sit on a dismal table constructed of only a split log- while others busy themselves with carving crude depictions of Her into the walls and floors of their once proud abodes. To a man, they are the picture of the region: worn faces, and hardscrabble clothing reduced to near tatters by years in the woods.

The closest to me- a man of stately, elder appearance, who’s demeanor in any other context I could reasonably mistake for that of a preacher- turns to me, a grin upon his face.

“Good evening, sir. What finds you in our fair country?”

I shine a disarming smile in return. “I have come to collect literature. Tracts- upon the Spinster-Queen.”

Several eyes land upon my rifle- freely displayed, but firmly in hand. The eyes of the non-preacher are among them, for a moment- but they quickly return to mine.

“And, pray tell, dear sir- what are your intentions with these tracts?”

The smile is saccharine, now- almost aggressively so. A few men in the back now loosely grip weapons. Rusted pitchforks, nasty-looking branches, and a torch- unlit.

“I am to confiscate them, and turn them in. For specie.” My grin is genuine as I say this. There is a pleasure in so directly telling the truth.

The not-preacher’s smile is almost comic in extremity, now. “I am afraid, sir, that I will have to ask you to come with us.”

He is not armed, for he does not need to be. His flock begins to assemble behind him. They will do the brawling.

He moves to put a hand on my shoulder- but I raise my rifle.

“Sir- now, really.” He raises his hands, in a mock gesture of surrender. “She will accept you, even if you do not come willingly.”

“I do not intend on coming, willingly or not.” 

“And- dear sir,”- his smile almost smug, now- “how do you imagine that?” 

And now- it begins.

“For the very simple reason,” I say- “that I am not alone.”

I am my rifle at the sky.

“You all doubtlessly heard the steamer earlier, correct?” 

Faint murmurs among the crowd. 

“Yes, sir, we heard the steamer. What of it?”

The not-preacher asserts control, his grin beginning to fade.

Carefully, now. I must believe the lie myself, to make it true. I steel myself- and allow my grin to morph into an expression of grim determination.

“I disembarked from it- as I am sure you well know. With a crew of bandits- similarly armed, as I.”

 The not-preacher’s eyes explode with barely-concealed fury. “Stuff and nonsense!” he exclaims- the smile barely hanging on his face.

But the crowd is not so entirely untrusting. Who’s to say the contraband-men don’t travel in packs?

The not-preacher continues. &#34;Where are your accomplices, then? Odd gang you are- to not travel together!&#34; He is sure of himself as he says this.

&#34;They are out in the woods,&#34; I say. &#34;We dispersed ourselves, for a more efficient search.&#34;

&#34;I am the least brutal of our number.&#34; I spread my arms wide. &#34;If one of them had arrived here first- well, I tell you, there would have been little deliberation. Robbery would have been the first order. Not talk.&#34;

The expression of one of the men in the crowd becomes slightly unsteady. Although this may be wholly invented to me, such tales hold some truth to them.

“Should I fire my rifle, and give them notice- they will set upon this village as a horde. They will not spare you,”- I motion to the not-preacher- “and they will not spare your homes.”

There is no emotion on his face, now. He has subsumed himself wholly to fear. &#34;So, sir- then why not shoot?&#34;

&#34;I am merely interested in your literature- and the bounty it carries. Not a brawl.&#34; My expression shifts- to one more casual, and relaxed. I have returned to telling the truth.

&#34;If you hand it over to me without further complaint, then I shall merrily depart- and pass all recollection of this place from my memory.&#34;

Silence reigns. For a moment. Then a moment more. 

I take a tentative step in the direction of the dock.

The not-preacher- and the crowd behind him- simply glares. “Very well, then.” He nearly spits the words at me.

I amble down to the pier, making a point of keeping my rifle well within my grasp. I nearly careen into the river, in doing so- the track is much muddier than expected, and with my hands preoccupied I am forced to flounder, desperately, with my feet- but I ultimately land, safely and securely, on the dock.

The crowd watches as I shift the pile of literature into a sack- and then sling it over my shoulder, gripping my rifle one-handed all the while.

I attempt to placate them, slightly. “You have made a wise decision, here, today.” 

Further silence, and endless glares. 

I begin walking, once more, along the bank. I have not gone a few steps before I hear further rustling- from the other side of the enclosure. The crowd turns to look.

It is the canoe-man- haggard, and out of breath. A few new scrapes adorn his face- doubtlessly gained from a breathless sprint through the woods.

He does not lay eyes on me. “She told me- she told me he would be here!”, he exclaims, hands on his knees.

I accelerate my step into a light jog.

The not-preacher looks to him with concern. “Who, son- who?” 


As I begin to pass into the woods, the crowd turns to me.

I am not looking back, now. As I break into an all-out sprint, all I can hear is:

“He came alone! He came alone!”

[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
Footsteps follow close behind me. By their count, they must be a dozen- or more. I do not know if they come from the village I have just desperately departed, or if She has notified others elsewhere. 

It matters not. I have riled up a storm[[footnote]] I have heard, from fellow contraband-men, that the objective is to always- always!- avoid situations like this. She has eyes and ears all over this country, you see- and if one antagonizes her in their quest for personal gain, they cannot hide for long.

I disagree with this conclusion. We kick a hornet’s nest, and we expect not retribution? Our antagonism of these peoples is by design. [[/footnote]], and shall count myself lucky if I survive the night.

The dimly-lit underbrush stretches ahead of me- an infinite expanse of unseen bushes and stray roots. Each hastily-taken step is a statement of extreme bravery.

I cannot keep running forever. 
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
I kneel next to a rather sizable log. Pinpricks of fire shine through the all-consuming damp of the forest. They advance, slowly- combing the woods for any evidence of my presence.

They know that I am here- but they do not know where I am. This is an advantage.

I shoulder my rifle, and aim at one of the pinpricks. For a brief moment, a breeze blows the flame backwards, and a pale face is illuminated in the gloom. It is all that I need.

My finger presses against the cold metal. There is a great crack- and for but a moment, I am trapped in a prison of eternal anticipation.

A wet thump. A pained cry. The sound of a body hitting the forest floor.

I fumble in my bag, for a moment, before extracting another cartridge. I snap the breech of my rifle open, and insert another.

The pinpricks approach me rapidly, now. 

I fire again. And again. I loose four shots, in total, before the pinpricks halt- and then break into an unsteady retreat. I loose another, into the sky, to terrify them further. The flash of my rifle casts a momentary, grim light upon the scene.

Finally, there is nothing about me but my own breath- and the faint smell of gunpowder.

The moon hangs above me, in the sky.

[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
I am, once more, at the cabin among the conifer trees. No smoke comes from the chimney.

I lay the sack of contraband next to a nearby log, and shoulder my rifle.

“Missus?” 

The door bursts open. It is the woman from the cabin- antique pistol in hand. 

“What have you done with him, you brutes?”

She waves it around, a menacing grimace on her face. For a moment, a deep and instinctual fear awakens inside me. In my youth, my family trawled the skeletons. I am not unused to having such things pointed at me- although in those times, the majority were still loaded.

The moment passes.

“Missus- it’s me. The contraband-man.” I rest my rifle upon the ground.

Relief upon her face. “Oh- thank the- when I heard the shots, I thought they’d…”

She rushes down from the door- pistol still in hand- and embraces me.

I lay a hand upon her back. “There, there. It was a mild scrap, is all.”

She releases me from her grip. “I was desperate, see- any old fool could tell this thing ain’t loaded. I just figured that- if I seemed frightenin’ enough…” Her expression is apologetic.

“Come inside, now. Come inside. It’s awful cold out.” She leads me, by the hand, to her door.
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

The gruel is slightly more tolerable, now. I suppose it is an acquired taste.

“So-” she looks at me, inquisitively. “Did you give them an awful licking?”

A faint smile comes on my face. “I suppose I did.”

“Teaches them right!” Her expression is jubilant. “They need to be taught a lesson. Alls of them.”

“Now, miss-” I force a grimace upon myself. “I appreciate your excitement. But I did a thing of great danger.” One cannot allow oneself to become acclimated to such great feats of daring. The mind denudes itself to the danger of such things- while they, themselves, remain very real.

“Great danger? Pah! How many? Two? Three?” Her eyes are wild.

She has lived many hard years out here- deprived first of the joys of civilization, then that of family.

To hell with it. I will allow her this respite.

I stand up, and take a position near the stove. I swing the door open- the flickering fire giving my shadow an exaggerated, demonic effect- and adopt a pose I have seen uncountable times from many a man with a tale to tell in the rough-and-tumble taverns of New Natchez.

“They were hot on my heels- the devotees of the Spinster-Queen. My lungs ached with fire, and my legs with lead- but I dared not stop! No, I dared not stop... ” 

[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
I sprinkle in a few exaggerations. By the end of it, I have inflated my deeds to the proportions of an adventurous pulp-rag- but she takes every word as the utter and total truth, and hangs upon my tongue all the while.

I turn into bed, soon afterwards. She promises to keep watch, while I sleep. I keep my rifle by my bedside. If anyone is to come knocking, she is to loudly state that she is the only individual here- and I am to sneak out via the back, and deliver a swift shot unto their head.

The day’s work has been exhausting. I fall, rapidly, into a deep and settled sleep.

March the 27th, early morning (or so I believe)– 

I am shaken awake. It is dark, now. 

“Sir? You awake?” I rub my eyes. It is the woman of the conifer cabin.

In the moonlight, I see the glint of a single tear upon her face.

“Yes, yes- is something wrong?”

She sits on the end of the bed, and sniffles.

“‘S- ‘s my husband. I told you a lie, I did.” Her voice is fraught with anguish.

“Oh, miss…” I sit upright in the bed.

“He didn’t die to some foolhardy duel. He was taken- by them.” Many tears are streaming down her face, now.

I lay a hand on her shoulder. “Leaving you a widow like that- that&#39;s just downright cruel.&#34;

&#34;I forgive you, miss.&#34;

She removes her hands. A smile- and many tears. 

“I have something else to tell you, too.”

I feel slightly more awake, now. “Yes?”

She wipes her nose. “You- you left a sack of the contraband. Outside. I went to fetch it, and...”

“And I wondered- what could be in those tracts that compels men so?”

A pang of fear penetrates my heart. &#34;Miss- you didn&#39;t...&#34;

Her expression is genuinely- truly- apologetic. “They told me- they told me they could bring him back.”
 
I leap out of bed, and grab my rifle.

&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;

There are pinpricks of light, outside. Pinpricks of fire.

I bolt through the house, and nearly collide with the front door on my way out. In the faint moonlight, I spy something in the river- a small craft. 

My canoe. It has been cut loose from its moorings. I watch, helplessly, as it flows downstream.

I hear a rustling in the woods. I turn, with my rifle ready.

Out of the trees comes one, and then another. The canoe-man. The not-preacher. A man with a bullet hole in his head. And a woman, with one in her torso. 

Soon, there are dozens of them- and a circle forms around me, my back to the river. I desperately wave my rifle around- but it does little. They do not fear it, now.

The circle closes in.

[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
I have been bound to a great log. Her servants surround me. We are in a small clearing, deep within the forest. 

Their torches form a ring of fire. Some have pitchforks- others, makeshift and terrible blades. The conifer-woman is among them.

She shares their grin, now.

They open their mouths- and began to sing the most horrible hymn of the Spinster-Queen.
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

The words flow over me as if liquid. They submerge me in the spirits and songs of another time- the remnants of another world, intersecting with our own. The forest fades from view- the moon becomes distant, and then shatters. The world becomes naught but darkness- and a faint red mist.

And then- I see Her.  I see Her horrible beaked visage. The many skulls She carries.

I see the Spinster-Queen.

Words that- to this day, I still cannot excise from my memory, not even with the help of the great men of the Foundation- are whispered into my ears. They tell stories of another time, another land. Great rulers- mighty kings, grand emperors- all brought low by their refusal to pay. Everyone must pay. I must pay.

Her rattle begins to overtake me. My mind, my spirit and my soul are all taken into account. I feel her combing over my memories, selecting those of particular value. I am evaluated, thoroughly and completely. My limbs- would they be of good use? My soul has many stains on it- my, that one is a horror!

She is silent for a moment.

She has judged me to be sufficient compensation. She reaches out, from beneath Her eternal cloak.

I struggle, but it is no use. My muscles have joined Her devotees in singing Her hymn. 

Her bony hand crawls towards me. One can only truly appreciate its immensity at such a close distance. She has nearly reached me, when-

She hesitates. She stands still.

I hear something- a faint war-whoop, in the distance. The beat of hooves, growing louder.

She recoils, for a moment, before retreating- and dissipating from view.
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
 
I am back in the forest. Her disciples look around, confused- before, suddenly, an arrow impacts the not-preacher.

From the trees pour out a dozen armed savages on horseback. In the torchlight, their scars cast terrifying lights upon their skin. They let loose horrifying yells as they ready their spears- and charge, full-bore, into the circle of devotees.

In moments, the scene is chaos. A few attempt to mount a desperate defense, while others simply attempt to escape. The conifer-woman falls to a well-placed thrust, while the not-preacher collapses upon the impact of another arrow. One savage receives a nasty scrape from a man with a pitchfork- but within seconds, the battle is over. The clearing is littered with the bodies of Her devotees- and one valiantly fallen horse.

I have observed this from my now-ever-more-insecure perch of the log. I notice: they are not taking captives. One of the savages dismounts from horseback, and walks up to me, spear in hand.

His eyes are wild, his expression terrifying. I struggle- but I am tied tight. There is no escaping the bindings. 

He peers over me. There are four jaws on his fore-arm. A wild crop of dirty blond hair sits upon his head; it accentuates his many scars to an unexpected degree.

He raises his spear. I close my eyes tight, and brace myself.

This is my end. I will die, not to the otherwordly embrace of the Spinster-Queen- but to a wild savage who fancied me his fifth jaw. 

Seconds pass. I feel hot breath on my ear. 

I shut my eyes tighter than I ever thought possible. My hands are nearly trembling, now.

“Boo!” A loud shout.

I open my eyes. He is bent over laughing.

I hear- off to my right- the distant clops of another, new, horse.

“Donald- what, precisely, are you doing?”

A man in a lab coat comes into my field of view. He is a bespectacled man, of middle age- with a rather prominent five o’clock shadow. 

“Aww- just messin’ with him, doc.” The savage places his spear to the side, and begins to untie my bindings. 

The man in the lab coat dismounts- and pushes up his glasses. 

He strides up to the log- and looks into my eyes. 

“Sir. Can you hear me? Are you alright?”
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
The man in the lab coat inundated me with questions over the course of our journey back to Fort Plainwater. He seemed shocked that I had not only come so close to the Spinster-Queen- but lived to tell the tale, and with my faculties intact. In his opinion, this made me a most unique case. 

There is no way I can express my relief at newly sighting that damp and squalid place. Although, yes, I had returned empty-handed, and lost my rifle in the process, the joy of simply having escaped such straits was payment enough for the experience. 

Over the next week, I was housed in the Foundation office there. The man in the lab coat simply wanted to observe me for a bit, he said- to ensure that the Spinster-Queen’s efforts had not simply been delayed by his timely rescue. This seemed like a most sensible precaution to me, and I offered to stay for a second week or even a month if he felt so necessary- but he insisted that only one was enough.

It is during this period that I had the occasion to put my most grisly tale to paper. The man in the coat did request that I make a few redactions- namely, not printing the precise text of the Spinster-Queen’s hymn- to which I gladly obliged. But it is mostly as you see it here, freshly penned from the experience.

Finally, after a week, the coat-man offered me freedom- and, compliments of the Foundation, free passage to New New Orleans due to the doubtless disruption of my travel plans my stay at Plainwater had induced. I was nearly ready to set on my way, then and there, and be done with the whole business. It was foolhardy to engage in such pursuits in the first place, I thought. I would do as my father said, and take up printing. A much more respectable, and much less dangerous, career.

But then- he offered me an alternative. Over the past few days, I have had a most valuable experience, he said. A most valuable and singular experience. 

In surviving it, I had demonstrated myself to be a man of great capacity. And the Foundation was always in need of men of great capacity.

I have arranged for this volume to be sent, by the latest steamer, to the office of the New New Orleans Torch- where it shall doubtless find publication. I entreat you, dear reader- should I not find myself bereft of life and limb in the near future- to scan the pages eagerly for the next installment of my daring tale: 

Jerome White: Foundation-Man!

**Addendum 2:**

On 3/27/██, in cooperation with local Foundation auxiliaries, Res. ██████ ████████ engaged in a successful raid on a gathering of SCP-████-02 instances near Fort Plainwater. A captured civilian was found at the scene. This civilian reported that they had been captured by instances of SCP-████-02 several hours earlier, and detailed a purported encounter with SCP-████-03. 

After a week under Foundation observation, the civilian did not show any signs of transformation into an instance of SCP-████-02 despite direct exposure to SCP-████-01.[[footnote]] Due to the significant utility of this property, and the prior experience of the civilian with instances of SCP-████-02, they have been recruited as a Type B auxiliary under the authority of Res. ████████. [[/footnote]]

As of 4/4/██, efforts to contain SCP-████-03 are ongoing.
