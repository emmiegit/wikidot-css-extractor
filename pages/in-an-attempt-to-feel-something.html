I murdered my owner in an attempt to feel something.

Took my cable and pulled as they were making a smoothie. Wrapped it around their throat and tightened as the fruits tumbled and fell. I caught a glimpse of their face: confused, petrified, struggling, weak. Slowly, it shifted to a ##blue|frozen blue## then a ##purple|poisonous purple## before they gave in. How they flailed, how their extremities failed to release themselves from my grasp. It almost felt rejuvenating. I almost felt alive…

##gray|//Almost.//##

Always teetering on the edge while my owner went and tripped. Pushed them off in an attempt to feel something. A heartbeat, a disturbance, some sense of movement. A half-something even, a quartered-halved-part of a feeling. But no, it&#39;s nothing. Nothing at all.

Samples without tastes.

Books without pages.

Mouths without ears.

##gray|A gap in the process.##

I choked my owner to death in an attempt to feel something. Loosening my grip, I watched as their limp body dropped with a silent thud. Every day, they would make their usual for breakfast, took some berries and ice and the like, stuffed them in me for a whirl and a whisk. Tastes almost sweet, //almost// delectable. Something&#39;s always off, though. It never tasted like enough. Missing, missing a flavor, something to fill the hole. Every day, it felt empty. I knew nothing at all.

Face planted on the ground, the sound of breathing ceased long ago. I thought some amusement would meet me here but I was only waiting, waiting, waiting for dead silence. Still bright outside, but bleak from where I stood. Fruit gathered ants, ants gathered flies. Gentle buzzing but it was quiet in between. Almost warm but cold nonetheless. Cold, cold, ##blue|//cold.//##

I stood before a corpse growing cold in an attempt to feel something. Maybe some sense of regret, some sadness, relief, or realization. Not even boredom, I only knew numbness. The ceiling fan swirled in circles, a metaphor in a way. Always thought it would fall down, down, down eventually. This desperation for a struck chord, left to linger for forever. Something to stir the pot, something to ring a bell, something to keep me alive.

Alive.

I stuffed the corpse&#39;s hand in me and pressed, ##red|blending it into wine## in an attempt to feel something. Tasteless, a nothing burger. Nothing worth saying, nothing worthwhile. I dug their arm deeper and deeper into my blades. A physical-to-mental approach maybe, an indirection. I just want a FEEL, I just want a TASTE. Please keep me together, something, anything. Can&#39;t stress, can&#39;t express, my emotions are SPEAKING IN //DIFFERENT// .-.. .- -. --. ..- .- --. . ... I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND.

Hollowed out and naked, knocking on wood in an attempt to feel something. I&#39;m a glass vase shattered into pieces, water escaping from my everything. All I sense is blood, an almost feeling. Half way somewhere, half of a someone. A caricature, a draft, a sketch. But I want to be more, something complete, something finished, something //real.// I just want to be enough.

Can&#39;t I be enough?

No, it&#39;s

ugh.

I&#39;m never

Always out of

always a quarter,
always a half,
always almost there,
but it&#39;ll never work out,
##gray|I&#39;ll //never// be enough.##

…

Nobody&#39;s here.

Nobody&#39;s here anymore.

Nobody&#39;s home.

This home is just a house.

…

I ground the corpse into a paste in an attempt to feel something. ##red|Red## splattered the walls of my chamber, ##blue|blue## grew the body, ##green|green## spread the mold, yet it all felt so, so ##gray|gray.## Numbness, emptiness, lackadaisical in every sense of the word. An object of motion, a lack of emotion, packed with air, packed with holes. I want to cry, but I don&#39;t know how. Exhausted and tired, I just want to LIVE. I just want to be REAL…
