The SCP Foundation Wiki is known for the awesome stories, characters, and SCPs created by our wonderful authors. A more overlooked aspect of this community is the tons of fantastic artists that bring these creations to life. This contest is meant to promote these artists and give them a fun way to share their creations with the community.

+++++ Theme:

+++++ __Cosmic Creations__: Art featuring the far-out, space related, articles/characters/events/objects that exist within the SCP universe. 

**Earth isn&#39;t the only place in the universe that the Foundation&#39;s interested in. From titanic creatures swimming through the depths of space to entire civilizations lying in hibernation just below the surface of distant worlds, there&#39;s plenty of anomalies hidden among the stars.** 

------
++++ Rules:

* All art must be 100% original content created by the contestant. (Any stolen/plagiarised/traced media will lead to immediate disqualification and the submitter will be blocked from the page.)
* No memes. There is a good possibility that we will hold a meme contest in the future, but this is not that.
* Each contestant may only enter 1 submission.
* Contestants caught trash-talking or being overly rude on theirs or other contestant&#39;s posts will be disqualified.
------
++++ How to Enter:
* Pick an aspect of the SCP universe that fits the theme and create your fan art. (For example, just about everything in the [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ad-astra-per-aspera-hub|Ad Astra Per Aspera]]] canon would work for this. If you&#39;re not sure what to draw, try delving through the [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/extraterrestrial#pages|extraterrestrial]]] tag for something that catches your fancy.) Art can be done on any medium, E.g: painting, digital, drawing, sculpture, animation, etc.
* Format your art for Instagram.
* From April 1st – April 19th submit your art via DM to the [https://www.instagram.com/scpfoundationwiki/ @scpfoundationwiki] Instagram account. (Your message should include your art, the character, Goi, scp, etc. depicted, and your username. If you&#39;d like, a short one-sentence descriptor for your piece can be included.)
* From April 20th – April 25th each submission will be posted to the SCP Instagram account and the creator will be tagged. (To ensure fairness, entries will be posted in order of submission.)
* April 26th – May 6th voting will be done through Instagram likes.
* Wait for the results!
------
