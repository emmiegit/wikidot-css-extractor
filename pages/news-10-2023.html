On the SCP Wiki, there are 48 canons, each a completely separate setting of the SCP Universe. SCP Wiki author [[*user Ralliston]] is the first person to have written for every single one. This is a monumental undertaking, so Site News Team asked Ralliston for an interview to get some behind-the-scenes perspective on what it was like to write for every canon. You can read it below!
&gt; Writing for every canon is a huge undertaking! What inspired you to write for every canon on site?

It definitely was quite challenging! I actually can&#39;t quite remember what made me want to do it in the first place (it&#39;s been more than 2 years since I initially started the challenge) but I am fairly certain that [[[uraniumempire|UraniumEmpire&#39;s Authorpage]]] was what sparked the initial idea for the challenge. Right at the top of the page, there is a hidden collapsible that shows what UE wants to do before they leave the site -- and one of those goals is writing for every canon. I can&#39;t say for certain if this is all that made me want to take on the challenge -- I&#39;ve definitely enjoyed reading and writing interconnected stories here on the site even before I decided to start my challenge, so it didn&#39;t entirely come out of nowhere -- but it definitely had a major impact on my undertaking.

&gt; What has been your favorite canon to write for and why?

There&#39;s been quite a lot of very fun canons along the way, but if I had to pick one, I&#39;d probably say [[[cool-war-2-hub|Cool War 2]]]. CW2 is little more than a collection of titles, of short and chaotic prompts for stories vaguely focused around anart. And, honestly? I really dig the freedom it offers. The concept of CW2 might seem silly on the surface (and trust me, the canon //is// very silly, but still), but the way it&#39;s presented almost immediately gives you a decent idea of what you want to do for it -- the themes of your article are immediately clear due to the prevalent anart motif the canon has going on, and the wonderfully unhinged titles it offers are absolutely fantastic prompts for your imagination.

&gt; What has been the most difficult canon to write for?

Either [[[doctors-of-the-church-hub|Doctors of the Church]]] or [[[Bellerverse]]]. They are the only canons for which I had to try and write for more than once. Some months ago, I wrote a piece set in both of them, trying to bypass having to spend a lot of time writing for two canons I didn&#39;t really quite enjoy. It failed, which forced me to come back to the drawing board -- and also made me lose all my energy to actually write for them, since the thought of needing to do more work for two settings I didn&#39;t really like wasn&#39;t the greatest. In the end, though, the work paid off. Failure might not feel so good, but it //did// leave me with some lessons in mind going forward -- lessons which I applied when writing my two next (now thankfully surviving) pieces for both of these canons.

&gt; Do you think your canon project has helped bring attention towards smaller and lesser-known canons?

I like to think so! I don&#39;t want to blow my own trumpet here, but I do think I have noticed an uptick in discussion regarding some older canons around a few SCP-focused servers. In particular, I think that my contributions to Cool War 2 (of which there have so far been 5) and my general enthusiasm towards the canon and writing for it helped with its small quasi-revival that happened around two years ago.

&gt; If an author is trying to write for a canon they have never written for before, would you have any tips for them?

Read. Read, read, //read//. Getting through the hub might introduce you to core concepts and themes of the canon, but without actually delving into its works you can&#39;t get the //vibes// its articles are going for, you know? Ideally, you&#39;d read the pieces most significant to the canon as a whole. You should do this, and -- where possible -- ask around: ask people who created the canon and those who have already contributed to it. Communication is key, and all that.

&gt; What do you think makes a good canon?

Streamlined, creative universality. Ideally, I think, a good canon should be able to handle many themes and topics -- it should be more than just a single series with a fixed beginning and end, without much place to explore new ground. A good canon is one that leaves room for new pieces whilst still having a strong, central concept that carries it forward -- one that both reimagines already familiar elements of the setting //and// gives the reader some new exciting ideas to sink their teeth into.

&gt; Have a free plug! What’s your favorite thing you’ve written during your canon project?

I do think that [[[Free Bird]]] is not only the best piece I&#39;ve written for the canon challenge but just one of my best pieces in general. It&#39;s a very personal tale of self-hatred, self-discovery, and freedom. Please do be aware that it //is// quite a heavy piece -- the content warnings should speak for themselves.

&gt; Last question. Is there anything else you would like to say to all the readers out there?

Write for your friends&#39;s -- or anyone else&#39;s, really -- stuff! Be it series, canons, Sites, characters, or places: there really are little better ways to push your comfort zone and improve as a writer than exploring new, uncharted literary territories. And I&#39;m sure that your friends would very much appreciate you doing this.

Remix-Con was a contest that many people entered, but only a few could win. With [[*user Long Arm Larry]] being the winner of the SCP category of Remix-Con 2023, the Site News team has decided to interview them to figure out their inspirations for their entry. 

&gt; Why did you remix this article? Did you see something that needed fixing, or was it to pay homage? Is there a reason you chose a Reagan article? 

The most interesting part about the contest to me was that each remixed work necessarily made a statement about the work it was remixing via the contrast between it and the original work. the author says something via their omissions or additions -- this is what the work lacked, this is what it could have been. This was a very interesting opportunity to do something artistically that I think a lot of people just sidestepped to make articles that were inspired by an on-site original but didn&#39;t really do much to actually reflect or play with the original content, functioning either essentially as just a continuation or as an independent piece. Which is fine, really, it resulted in lots of great stuff, but to me, this was a chance for a lot of extra depth I really didn&#39;t want to miss out on.

1981 was a very happy coincidence because it provided both a legendary and well-known original so that any statement I made would actually land both ways and complex enough subject matter that I had room to do something interesting with it.

&gt; What inspired you to make the changes you did? What made you decide to portray Reagan the way you did? Did how he handled the AIDS/HIV crisis in real life inspire what you decided to do in your fictional portrayal? 

I mostly just wanted to really dig into what exactly makes Reagan so vile. A lot of handlings of him tend to sink into sort of broad-strokes takedowns about his general conservatism – which aren’t exactly wrong, to be clear, but somewhat sidestep the truly heinous stuff he did. 

Reagan’s portrayal in the article is a bit of a deliberate caricature. the real Reagan was charismatic and smooth, but fundamentally a shell of a man -– not the villainous arch-conservative demon he’s written as. This was both artistic intent and the result of me only having so much time to research the article – perfecting Reagan’s mannerisms would have required a lot of time for very little reward, and for the point of conveying the story and emotions that I wanted to the caricature works well enough.

&gt; As you remixed a Reagan article, What is your opinion on the SCP Reagan trend? Do you feel like any of the other Reagan SCP articles could use a remix as well?

I don&#39;t really have much of an opinion on the trend. He&#39;s a prominent political figure, so he&#39;s prominent in the consciousness of the wiki. So it goes. From what I’ve read of the other Reagan articles, I wouldn&#39;t really say any could &#34;use&#34; a remix -- although [[[Apotheosis of the Rat]]] is fantastic, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested.

&gt; Do you like your article or the original better? 

I think it&#39;s hard to say I &#34;like&#34; one better. A piece of historical fiction about the AIDS epidemic is in a completely different league compared to what is essentially just a very well-executed lost media creepypasta. If I had to sit down and evaluate how 7918 and 1981 perform in their respective genre, I would say 1981 outclasses it by orders of magnitude. its status as a classic is well-deserved.

&gt; What is your favorite entry of remix con besides your own? Is there another article you almost went with instead?

I really quite liked [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/illcovetyouifyoucoverme|CO█VE█T███]]]. personally my favorite of the tale entries -- just fantastic prose, really great stuff.

I initially wanted to do a riff on 2798, but figured that it wouldn&#39;t really have enough appeal to be worthwhile. As you can probably tell I didn&#39;t really consider the idea much -- I locked onto 1981 hard and fast from the start, and what you see is the result of that.

&gt; Thank you very much for your answers! Anything else you’d like to say?

I had a great time participating in the contest, and I appreciate everyone that&#39;s taken the time to go read and vote on 7918. Thank you for giving me the chance to talk about it! Also, check out my [[[https://twitter.com/evtacoma|twitter ]]] if you want to see more about my writing both on and off-site.

Congratulations to the Czech Republic branch for celebrating 4 years of being an official branch of the SCP Wiki! To celebrate this accomplishment, they are holding a JamCon with the theme of cliches! You can check out the entries [[[http://scp-cs.wikidot.com/cs-contest-klise-hub|here]]].

To hear about this achievement from a more personal standpoint, we have contacted [[*user Utylike]] to talk to us about the Czech branch!

&#34;I am simply not sure what to say. I am simply delighted to know that the project (the CS branch), which I helped create in 2019, is still alive and going strong, even if we are probably the smallest branch. I am proud to be a part of our lovely little community of writers and translators.&#34;

&gt; So you helped create it! Definitely happy to hear your thoughts! Do you have any translated articles you believe people should check out?

&#34;Yes, I did help create it. Back in 2019, me and another user &#39;Hawkeye&#39; were the original founders of the CS branch. It took a lot of effort and time on our part as well as the INT team which led us through the process but we managed to estabilish a strong and dedicated little community for our language. Since there aren&#39;t that many Czech speakers as with other languages, we will probably remain one of the smallest branches but that is alright with us. In the recent year, we&#39;ve had a bit of an awakening. Last year we suffered a decline in activity but it turned to be just a temporary setback as we are now breaking our own records in activity with the latest contests seeing almost 20 contestants (please keep in mind we are a very small community). Slowly but shortly we are leading a campaign to rework many outdated and old parts of the community. Now, as for the translations, that is perhaps one of our biggest weaknesses and I personally wish to remedy that in the following months. Our international representation. As of right now, there are only a handful of translations from Czech to English on the INT wiki and they are mostly... not our best? I am almost ashamed of that fact so yes, we will be working on it soon. But I can tell you, that our first step is to translate the winner of our current Jamcon! So there&#39;s that to look forward to!&#34;

&gt; Alright! Well thank you very much for your answers, I can tell you&#39;re passionate about your community, even if it&#39;s small. The number doesn&#39;t matter, the amount of love in it does.

&#34;Exactly! Thank you so much for offering us a little spotlight in your Site news. ❤️ We are honored to be a part of this incredible project and community.&#34;

It&#39;s October, and the groups of interest are out to play! In this unofficial community-run event, a different GOI, character, or concept tag unrelated to the Foundation has been assigned to each day of October. The goal is to read articles with these tags, optionally draw artwork based off of them, or even write your own take on the tag! If you do so, you are encouraged to add it on the [[[goitober2023|GOITOBER 2023]]] page to help share it with others. Happy reading!

+ Writing Prompts
[[/div]]

Site News is bringing you monthly writing prompts! Every month there will be three user-submitted prompts to help inspire new pieces. Participation in these prompts is completely optional, and any pages based on the prompts will be featured in the next issue of Site News! If you&#39;re interested in submitting a prompt for next Site News, send a wikidot PM to [[*user ParallelPotatoes]]. (One prompt per person)
This month&#39;s writing prompts are below! We only had two submissions this month, but we would love to see more!

[[size x-large]]Legends Never Die[[/size]] //Submitted by Lemonsense//
There&#39;s a lot of canons on the wiki, but not all of them receive equally as much attention. Write an article for a Canon that hasn&#39;t received a new work in over a year.

[[size x-large]]SC…P?[[/size]] //Submitted by Clives000//
Despite the Foundation&#39;s best efforts, sometimes they get it wrong. Not all SCPs are dangerous, and some shouldn&#39;t be an SCP at all. Write an article or tale about a harmless, normal human, animal, object or liquid that achieved SCP status by simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Why were they classed as an SCP, and will the Foundation ever realise that they made a mistake?

The following article was inspired by a prompt and written this month!

[[size x-large]][https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/what-would-you-bring What Would You Bring?][[/size]] //Written by Cicada3301Fan//
Inspired by &#34;A tale about SCPs 6600 through 6699&#34; from September 2023&#39;s prompts!

If you write an entry inspired by this or a previous month&#39;s prompts, feel free to send a wikidot PM to [[*user ParallelPotatoes]] to have it featured in the next Site News!

Like before, we are still renovating this section. It will likely be a couple months, but we will soon have a nice little stats section here. In the meantime, please enjoy our monthly charts.

Also, what do __YOU__ want to see in the monthly stats section? Any data you want to know about? Please leave a comment about it in the Discussion page or use [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTm7UWLqekHiapGYcbns0GAY1jtIB0Xy93FqQPxc2S2I-wVA/viewform this anonymous google form.]
