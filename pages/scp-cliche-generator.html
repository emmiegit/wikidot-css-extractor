To be honest, you felt pretty lucky that you were assigned to one of the least dangerous skips you could think of. It wasn&#39;t memetic (or antimemetic for that matter) and all you were required to do was talk to it. The thing eats //paper// for God&#39;s sake!

[[module ListUsers users=&#34;.&#34;]]
&#34;%%title%%, we&#39;re ready for you in [[[SCP-2020]]]&#39;s containment cell,&#34; a researcher calls to you, entering the room with a small, plastic clipboard.
[[/module]]
You get up from your seat, a little apprehensive but not too frightened, and follow her into SCP-2020&#39;s cell.


&#34;Hi!&#34; SCP-2020 says, sitting in its chair. &#34;It&#39;s nice to have someone to talk to. I&#39;m working on some ideas of mine. Writing, you know. Do you write stories by any chance?&#34;

&#34;I do, actually. I haven&#39;t recently because I&#39;ve been having some trouble thinking of anything to write about though.&#34;

&#34;Oh, me too! Maybe, maybe we should brainstorm some ideas together? It always helps me to talk with people about ideas.&#34;

You consider for a moment before responding.

&#34;Sure, I don&#39;t see why not.&#34;

The both of you discuss some of the things you&#39;ve written before SCP-2020 comes up with an idea that gets your attention:
