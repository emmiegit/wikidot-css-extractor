**Special Containment Procedures: ##7d7098|Containment Procedures have been deemed no longer necessary.##**

**Description:** SCP-7603 **##7d7098|was##** the sapient, pseudo-indestructible skeleton of the royal Tartarean entity, Babalon. Through empathetic readings, it has been determined that this entity is able to hear its surroundings, despite not possessing auditory sensory organs. SCP-7603 **##7d7098|gave##** off trace amounts of TRE radiation, comparable to 12% of what would be expected of the typical, complete Tartarean specimen.

The object appears to be the skull of a Jackal-like species, most closely resembling that of a golden jackal //(Canis aureus)//. However, SCP-7603 is notably larger than that of a typical member of the species it mimics, and is comprised of soulstuff. SCP-7603 does not possess nerve or sinus entry points, its braincase **##7d7098|had previously been completely airtight, prior to its termination.##**

Like the typical skull of a Tartarean entity, SCP-7603 **##7d7098|was##** almost completely indestructible. Only implements that have been blessed against Tartarean entities would be capable of penetrating it. Inside its braincase **##7d7098|was##** an amount of liquid soulstuff, which  **##7d7098|functioned##** as its brain. When held or touched by a Tartarean entity, that subject  **##7d7098|would have been##** capable of forming a temporary, one-way empathetic link with SCP-7603. The Tartarean subject **##7d7098|was##** capable of sensing the apparent emotional state of SCP-7603, which **##7d7098|was##** often described as unwell.

**Date:** 08/13/2022

**Location:** Site-666

**Personnel Present:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6607 Sheldon Katz, Esq.] //(Legal Department)//, Primrose Fatish Von Trevil, Esq. //(Independent Contractor)//
----
**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Fatish Von Trevil:** Firstly, thank you for doing this for me, Sheldon. I greatly appreciate your assistance in this matter, as well as assisting Adrian with their boat. This matter is... very personal to me.

**Katz:** Of course, all I&#39;m doing is being a middleman. But yeah, let&#39;s begin. 

**Katz:** Primrose Fatish Von Trevil, Esq., you&#39;re motioning for the full decommission of SCP-7603. You&#39;re doing this on the basis that there is nothing more to learn from this entity, and that this presents an ethics concern. Before we get to your argument, we have one question. First, how did you come to know of SCP-7603?

**Fatish Von Trevil:** Thank you. I had been familiarizing myself with the Level 1 documentation of all objects in Site-666, and discovered that SCP-7603 was in your custody.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** Also relevant, allow me to state my bias in this matter. I am one of SCP-7603, or Babalon&#39;s, children. I have a personal and familial relation to this entity. That being said, I feel the argument for decommissioning is one worth making.

**Katz:** Much appreciated. You may proceed.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** My motion to decommission stems from two main points: the lack of significant research opportunity, and the humane treatment of sapient objects.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** Most relevantly, SCP-7603 does not represent any prospects for research opportunity, because she is identical to every other demon who has had their soulstuff stripped away from them. This is a well-researched phenomena amongst both demons and angels. I am to believe the primary reason SCP-7603 is given a designation and protections is because SCP-7603 is Babalon, and while that is a reason for containment, I do not believe there is a reason to allow her to persist in her current state.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** This is coming from someone who knows that attempts to restore her to an able-bodied state are currently impossible. Hell has spent //countless// resources attempting to restore high-value persons of interest from this state for over a millennia. The development may come eventually, but I have doubts that it will come within a timeframe that is reasonably humane.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** Additionally, little to no information can be gathered from her. She is only capable of establishing brief empathetic links to a demon that is holding her. One could tell when she is sad, angry, shellshocked, etcetera, but she could never give a proper testimony, because demons are incapable of controlling what is sent out through empathetic link. There is no &#34;happy for yes, sad for no,&#34; it is how we feel.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** And lastly, keeping her alive is cruel. She is effectively in a conscious coma, unable to act or communicate in a significant manner. Furthermore, most demons have reported that her mind-state is &#34;unwell.&#34; We are able to tell that she is suffering from her mere physical existence.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** Closing statement; keeping her alive is both cruel and unnecessary. This is not an argument for her release into my custody; this is euthanasia. It is a common sentiment for containment by agencies like the Foundation to be considered a form of burial.  I simply wish to end my mother&#39;s needless suffering.

**Addendum-7603-2:**


[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Date:** 10/19/2022

**Location:** Site-666

**Personnel Present:** Sheldon Katz, Esq. //(Legal Department)//, Primrose Fatish Von Trevil, Esq. //(Independent Contractor)//, Captain Adrian //(Familiar/Paralegal/Emotional Support Animal/Boat Captain)//, Dr. Astia Fatish Von Trevil //(Wife of Primrose Fatish Von Trevil)//, Morningstar Fatish //(Primrose Fatish Von Trevil&#39;s Half-Brother)//

**Foreword:** After gaining expedited review from the Ethics Committee board of directors, Primrose Fatish Von Trevil Esq.&#39;s request for SCP-7603&#39;s decommissioning had been granted. Because of her efforts in the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6607 2022 SCP-IRS Accords], Primrose Fatish Von Trevil&#39;s immediate family had been permitted to observe.

For readability, participants will be referred to by their first names in this log.

//[Katz, Primrose, and her family sit around Conference Room B&#39;s table. Adrian hovers between Morningstar and Astia&#39;s head]//

**Primrose:** Good afternoon, everyone. Shall we begin?

**Astia:** Yes yes, I&#39;m ready. It is about time. Why on Earth did it take two whole months to get this ready?

**Adrian:** Foundation paperwork, mostly due to having four, technically five, demons in the same room on site. We also had to prepare for October. You know how that month is.

**Astia:** Ughh why must that get in the way though? The expense was a mere cheese platter, a bullet, and a prayer. All when my Rosey could simply tap her mother on the head. Why even bring in some... filthy blessed thing into the equation?

**Sheldon:** That&#39;s partially why it took so long. We aren&#39;t doing that.

**Sheldon:** I felt bringing holy bullets to a demon funeral would be... a bit tasteless. So Prim and I have been negotiating something with the Ethics Board after her appeal. Prim&#39;s allowed custody of what&#39;s left after Babalon&#39;s decommission.

**Primrose:** In exchange for allowing me to peacefully euthanize mother and gain possession of her Soul Gem, Morningstar has agreed to assist the Foundation in creating and mass producing a line of ammunition to target angels as well as demons.

**Morningstar:** The negotiations were... rather difficult

**Adrian:** Nah, bullshit. You did great, buddy. Best negotiation I&#39;ve ever been a part of.

**Morningstar:** Yes, well, the flash cards you prepared for me were extremely helpful.

**Adrian:** Of course they were, I&#39;m the best emotional support imp around.

**Primrose:** Thank you. And do not think I have forgotten about our promise, Morningstar.

**Morningstar:** I know you haven&#39;t.

//[Adrian places their hand on Morningstar Fatish&#39;s shoulder.]//

**Adrian:** Yeah big guy, we got your back... Seriously though, I&#39;m thinking we&#39;re ready.

**Sheldon:** Should I bring her in?

**Primrose:** Please.

//[Sheldon motions to the guards. A moment later, a portable containment locker containing SCP-7603 is brought in, and set on the table.]//

**Primrose:** May I... may I hold her?

**Sheldon:** Of course.

//[Primrose lifts SCP-7603, and holds the object out so that she can look.]//

**Primrose:** Um... Hello Babalon. That feels odd.

**Primrose:** Well, I suppose I should introduce myself, it has been just under 2000 years and I have... grown up a bit. My name is Primrose Fatish Von Trevil. But you knew me as your son. Pluto Theleman.

**Primrose:** I am... I am your daughter.

**Adrian:** I&#39;m her Familiar. And Bestie.

**Astia:** I&#39;m her wife. Pleasured to meet you.

**Morningstar:** ... You know who I am.

//[Primrose reports SCP-7603 feeling a mix of surprise, relief, happiness, and concern.]//

**Primrose:** I... suppose I should tell you what you missed. Therion is dead. We killed him. As you... might have guessed, from him not coming back for you. Morningsta- er, you knew him as the Red Dragon, but Morningstar helped.

**Morningstar:** Ma&#39;am. You raised a wonderful daughter. I&#39;m happy to have acted as her guardian.

**Primrose:** He was instrumental in killing him. And... I could not have done it without him. Or you... I am surprisingly not good at this, am I?

//[According to Primrose, SCP-7603 feels &#34;a bit of humor.&#34;]//

**Primrose:** Well hah, right... Well, he suffered. And I inherited his power, so of course I am doing well enough. But more importantly, I have people who actually care for me, now. Just as much as you did. I wanted to just say... thank you for being there for me, and giving me the tools I needed to... fix things as best I can. It is only fair that I return the favor.

//[Primrose gestures, and an ornate, thorned pitchfork appears in her hands.]//

**Primrose:** Are you uhm... ready to go?

//[There is a pause. Primrose Fatish Von Trevil&#39;s breathing gets heavy. She inhales, and smiles, despite tears forming in her eyes.]//

**Primrose:** I... had thought about this day for centuries... I am... glad. Glad that I could not only bring you your last moment, but ensure it is a positive one... I love you. And I never stopped loving you.

//[Primrose sets SCP-7603 on the table, and gently places her hand on SCP-7603&#39;s temple for a moment. She stands, and softly places her weapon against SCP-7603&#39;s forehead.]//

**Primrose:** G-good bye, Mother. Io Babalon.

//[After Primrose exhales, the room is filled with a soft, purple light for one millisecond. In SCP-7603&#39;s place lays a small, dull purple crystal. Primrose doesn&#39;t move for several moments. A faint whimper could be heard.]//

**Morningstar:** You gonna be okay, Rose?

**Primrose:** ... She was... She was proud of me.
