**Item#:** **##red|This anomalous entity in particular##**

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** **##red|The object in question##** is to be contained in a lead-lined cell in sub-basement 12 of Site 57. **##red|Our prisoner##** is to be subjected to a constant barrage of 7.62 mm gunfire to the head from an M134 minigun. Each barrel of the minigun has been inscribed with &#34;GIFT DISPENSER,&#34; each shell casing labeled &#34;WRAPPING PAPER,&#34; and each round labeled &#34;AS PER DOCUMENT-615-OMEGA.&#34; 

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Document-615-Omega&#34; hide=&#34;- NOTICE: By order of Site Director Naismith, editing of Document-615-Omega without Site Director approval is punishable by Super Termination.&#34;]]
&gt; In exchange for one small, metallic, bullet-shaped gift, **##red|he who&#39;s currently being shot at by a gun labeled &#34;GIFT DISPENSER&#34;##** agrees to not leave this cell for another year. 
&gt; 
&gt; Verbal acceptance of these terms is heretofore null and void; consent is to be acquired only by **##red|the aforementioned bullet sponge##** meeting at least one of the following criteria
&gt; * Dermal contact with said gift,
&gt; * The existence of any living or deceased person on the Earth named &#34;Dave,&#34;
&gt; * Having one or more of the following:
&gt;&gt; * A pulse
&gt;&gt; * Atomic mass
&gt;&gt; * An IQ over 0
&gt; 
&gt; Signed,
&gt; //Site Director Dr. Lisle Naismith//
&gt; //**##red|That gunshot wound recipient we were talking about##** [Signed as per Ethics Committee Resolution-5813, in that all actions under the purview of &#34;Being a Little Bitch&#34; is heretofore defined as a legal signature under Foundation jurisdiction]//
[[/collapsible]]

In the event of a containment breach, **##red|this person##** can be temporarily subdued by memetic trigger phrases such as &#34;Fleetwood Mac is overrated!&#34; and &#34;Dude, seriously, bragging about how much //Rumors// changed your life is not a magic spell to make poetry majors give you a handy!&#34; Both of these cause **##red|said anomalous humanoid##** to break down into fits of crying.

**Description:** **##red|So, there&#39;s this guy and he##** is a reality-warping entity native to **##006400|[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/taboo that place] with lots of trees and all the name-lacking folks that we&#39;re running out of alternative names for to the point where we&#39;re considering outsourcing the stupid-alternative-names thing to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2337 an expert in the field]##**, but has since been banned for life for undisclosed reasons.

**##red|The entity formerly known as &#34;this person&#34;##** takes the appearance of a middle-aged Caucasian man dressed only in an oversized Florida Marlins jersey. **##red|The fellow&#39;s##** hair is long and matted, which **##red|this individual##** rationalizes with &#34;Some Polish chick I met at Coachella said the mat stores all the fuckin&#39; diseases that big pharma wants to poison us about.&#34; 

**##red|This bipedal scabies aggregation outpost##** is a hostile and opportunistic thief, abusing the laws of **##006400|in-livings woodly sans nomenclatural, cack!##** as a means of acquiring things to sell for beer money.

The Foundation first learned of **##red|he who smells like soup##** from reports of a dangerous reality bender in Downer&#39;s Grove, Illinois.

&gt; &lt;Begin Log&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; (**##red|Guy##** wanders into the hockey section of a Dick&#39;s Sporting Goods, then defecates on the floor. The manager, PoI-59600, arrives on the scene.)
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-59600:** Whoa, whoa, what the fuck?! You can&#39;t do that here!
&gt; 
&gt; **##red|Same guy##:** It&#39;s a gift.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-59600:** Get out.
&gt; 
&gt; **##red|Still same guy##:** No-no-no, wait. I can explain. It&#39;s a gift. You&#39;re a manager, right? So this is your territory. Your territory has my gift in it. So, you already accepted. I&#39;m gonna take something of equal value now.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-59600:** //I don&#39;t want people to shit on the floor.//
&gt; 
&gt; **##red|Yeah, still him##:** No take-backsies. You owe me one of your lungs now. //Yadda-yadda abra-ca-lung-have.//
&gt; 
&gt; (PoI-59600&#39;s left lung appears in **##red|its new owner&#39;s##** hand. PoI-59600 falls to the floor, coughing up blood.)
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-59600:** Security!
&gt; 
&gt; **##red|Das Lungtakenermensch##:** Dude. Calm down. Listen. I think we both need to sit down and have a serious talk about how morality is subjective and this is totally okay.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-59600:** GET AWAY FROM ME!
&gt; 
&gt; **##red|Guy with three lungs##:** Okay, but that&#39;s a //favor//, and that&#39;ll be another lung--
&gt; 
&gt; (**##red|Lung thief##** suddenly urinates on the floor.) 
&gt; 
&gt; **##red|The recently pissed##:** Ah, geez, sorry boss. Couldn&#39;t make it to the trash can. I&#39;mma have to take your not-being-a-fish.
&gt; 
&gt; (PoI-59600 transforms into a mackerel.)
&gt; 
&gt; **##red|Fishmaker##:** I gotta go now, but I don&#39;t wanna leave bad vibes or nothin&#39;, so... we&#39;re agreed on the fact that fairy law means I&#39;ve done nothing wrong, right? Flop if you agree.
&gt; 
&gt; (PoI-59600 chokes to death on the air, without flopping.)
&gt; 
&gt; **##red|Makefisher##:** Psh. Have fun bein&#39; //wrong,// fucko.
