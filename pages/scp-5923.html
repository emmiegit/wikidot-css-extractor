++++ **Special Containment Procedures**: 

Embedded Foundation agents are to funnel funds to the Republic of Turkey&#39;s Ministry of Culture and Tourism, to operate SCP-5923-A as a tourist attraction.  Disinformation campaigns are to be spearheaded to label SCP-5923-A as a UNESCO World Friendship and Peace Village to attract tourism.  Advertisement campaigns encouraging tourism in the area are to be disseminated throughout Europe and Asia.

Guided tours and vendors will be contracted to organize tourist activities and several dwellings are to be restored.  At least two &#34;maintenance&#34; Foundation agents are to reside in the restored dwellings at any given time.

++++ **Description**: 

SCP-5923 is a series of anomalous dreams that can occur in a certain segment of the population of Europe and Asia: most often creatives and individuals who attest to feeling at odds with society. A common psychological feature in subjects is the belief that they do not belong to their time or given community. 

The dreams that make up SCP-5923 occur once per lunar cycle, at minimum, but can be as often as ten times in the same period.  During an SCP-5923 event, despite some small variations, individuals will consistently experience the following sequence of events:
* At the outset of an SCP-5923 event, subject will approach a small river shrouded in mist and be ferried across by a man in early 20^^th^^ century clothes. No discerning features of the individual can be remembered by the subject.
* After the river crossing, the subject will come upon a large town constructed of stone, also shrouded in mist.
* Figures move along the streets of this town but appear unaware of the subject. These figures, designated SCP-5923-1, lack identifying features and seem to be animate shadows. 
* The subject will walk through the town’s streets, eventually reaching the central town square which is dominated by an old Greek Orthodox Church.
* On the steps of the church is a genderless individual, dressed in white, hooded robes that shine brightly. The figure will stand up at subject’s approach and take their hand, guiding them into the church.
* The shining figure speaks with subject, but the only consistent feature of their words from subject to subject is the phrase: “Come to me and belong.”  At this point, the subject awakens.

Approximately 26% of those who experience an SCP-5923 event report a persistent longing during the period of time these events occur.[[footnote]]Despite this, there is no compulsion effect or cognitohazardous aspect to an SCP-5923 event.  Subjects who complain of this longing compare it to an ordinary dream where one meets their one true love or other meaningful life event.  In most cases, the longing dissipates over time.[[/footnote]]  SCP-5923 events have been found to vary in their length; some subjects who experience an event only do so for short periods of time, while others experience the event for months or years on a consistent basis.  

One pattern identified is that SCP-5923 events have never been recorded to occur with individuals with criminal records or those who are socially ostracized from the community. Subjects experiencing SCP-5923 events are usually well-respected in their community or their given trade.

**Discovery**: SCP-5923 was first recorded in the 1931 unpublished poem “//My Home//” by famed Turkish 20^^th^^ century poet Neyzen Tevfik.  The following is an excerpt, translated from Turkish.
[[=]]
&gt; Mist enshrouds my heart
&gt; cobblestones calling to me
&gt; hark, shining guardian
&gt; where are your halls 
&gt; blessed be the stones of your dreaming streets[[footnote]]In journals from this period, Tevfik describes a recurring dream that is undoubtedly an SCP-5923 event.  In the following years, Tevfik would often write of a desire to find the village in his dreams so that he could “//finally go home//,” despite the fact he was born in the port city of Şehirin Ruhu.[[/footnote]]
[[/=]]

Cross-references of numerous personal journals, therapy records, and public statements by creatives throughout the 20th century revealed that several thousand individuals have experienced SCP-5923 events.

In 1999, Dr. Jocasta Rossi reported a recurring dream to her security-cleared therapist.  On the advice of the therapist, and given the frequency of the dreams, Dr. Rossi began researching the phenomenon and confirmed that she was experiencing an SCP-5923 event.  Upon receipt of her report, O5 Command authorized the usage of a prototypical oneirosensory visualization recording device.[[footnote]]Records digital rendering of subject’s dreams.[[/footnote]]  The following is transcript of the recorded SCP-5923 event.

Cross-referencing of descriptions of SCP-5923 events and the recording of Dr. Rossi’s experience, the area was confirmed to be the village of Kayaköy, Turkey, since designated as SCP-5923-A.

SCP-5923-A has been abandoned since 1923 after the close of the Greco-Turkish War and a treaty that required a population exchange between the two nations.  The village was predominantly populated with ethnically Greek families who were forced to relocate to Greece.  The village is in significant disrepair; over five hundred structures are still standing, albeit without surviving roofs.

Abandoned village of Kayaköy, Turkey.
[[/div]]
[[/div]]
On 22/12/1999, MTF-Beta-777 (“Hecate’s Spear”)  were mobilized to explore and gather information concerning SCP-5923-A. Additionally, several psionics[[footnote]]Individuals with psychic abilities, on loan from MTF-Omega-20 (“Thought Police”).[[/footnote]] were also mobilized to aid in the reconnaissance.  Captain Maria Waltham was in command of the mission.  Embedded agents within the Turkish Security Agency made falsified reports concerning tectonic activity within the area, and the MTF was inserted under the guise of a damage assessment on the ruins.

SCP-5923-A was confirmed to be abandoned, with no living entities residing within.  Akiva readings were normal and there was no evidence of anomalous energies within the ruins. The only structure that resonated with the psionics was the debilitated church ruins in the town center. Both the church and the square registered significant residue of emotional trauma, most easily relatable to feelings of deep loneliness and being lost.

After four hours, Command called a halt to the exploration as the MTF captain had separated from the team and could not be located.  An extensive search of the ruins did not reveal her location and no signal from her transponder was received.

__Received on 23/12/1999__, @ 21:05 hours:

The street and buildings are also exhibiting non-Euclidean geometrics as they fold in upon themselves, shifting the camera between different elevations and rapidly restructuring from one layout to another.  Waltham sways and falls, landing on her side and not moving.  The streets continue to rearrange themselves, occasionally placing the view from Waltham’s camera inside a structure.  This continues for nearly twelve minutes until all movement ceases. It is impossible to gauge Waltham&#39;s location within the village when restructuring ceases. She does not move.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //**Do you like it this way?**//
&gt; 
&gt; //[Waltham does not respond. She is believed to be unconscious.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //**Oh.**//
&gt; 
&gt; //[Footage continues for another forty-eight minutes until camera stops recording automatically due to lack of bodily movement.]//


__Received on 24/12/1999__, @ 17:06 hours:
&gt; //[Waltham is sitting on a small wooden dock.  The camera is looking out across the dark waters of the river.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Waltham**: Just want to go home. There’s been so many of those restructuring events... I don’t know what it wants.
&gt; 
&gt; //**For you to stay!**//
&gt; 
&gt; //[Waltham stands and looks around, one hand on her holstered pistol.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Waltham**: Look, I don’t want to stay. I want to go.
&gt; 
&gt; //**Because you don’t like it.**//
&gt; 
&gt; **Waltham**: No! Please don’t –  
&gt; 
&gt; //[The riverbank, docks and surrounding buildings again start folding in on themselves, shifting Waltham’s view to that of the town square with the church. The camera catches a glimpse of a figure huddled on the steps, stained white robes splayed out on the stones.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[Waltham groans and pitches forward, catching herself as she starts to fall on the lip of the wall surrounding the central fountain.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Waltham**: Listen to me! Please stop, and just talk to me. 
&gt; 
&gt; //**What is it?**//
&gt; 
&gt; **Waltham**: You clearly want something, right?
&gt; 
&gt; //[Entity shrugs and looks down at the stone steps it is sitting on.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Waltham**: Where are all the people from the dreams? The boat man, and the shadow people in the streets?
&gt; 
&gt; //**All me.**//
&gt; 
&gt; **Waltham**: They’re part of you?
&gt; 
&gt; //**Are me.**//
&gt; 
&gt; //[Waltham sits up, with her back against the rim of the fountain.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Waltham**: //[Indicating the surrounding buildings with her hands.]// What is all this?  It’s not the actual village, I’ve seen that and it’s in ruins.
&gt; 
&gt; //**All me.**//
&gt; 
&gt; //[The figure grasps its head and begins rocking back and forth on the stairs.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Waltham**: Calm down, I’m not attacking you or anything.  Just trying to understand.
&gt; 
&gt; //[The figure in the stained robes sits up and seemingly stares in Waltham’s direction, although no features are discernible under the hood.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //**No one comes.**//
&gt; 
&gt; **Waltham**: To the village.  No one comes to the village!
&gt; 
&gt; //[The figure nods rapidly.]//
&gt;  
&gt; //**Yes yes! But then I felt you wandering, with the others... So, you should stay!**//
&gt; 
&gt; //[Waltham stands shakily, continuing to hold onto the rim of the fountain, and takes a deep breath.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Waltham**: I can’t stay, especially not here. 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Figure starts to wail loudly, clutching its head again.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Waltham**: Wait, just wait... What if other people came to visit?  How would that make you feel?
&gt; 
&gt; **//Yes yes yes yes yes!**//
&gt; 
&gt; **Waltham**: Listen, I need you to trust me.  I think I have a solution, but first I have to get out of here, ok?
&gt;
