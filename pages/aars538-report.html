{{&gt;REPORT ACCESS GRANTED}}

&gt; +++ HUMAN INVESTIGATION REPORT
&gt; 
&gt; **SUBJECT:** Autonomic Analysis and Response System 538 (AARS538)
&gt; **REPORTER:**  Agent ███████████
&gt; **DATE**: June 17, 2011
&gt; **LOCATION**: ██████████████, ███████████████████
&gt; 
&gt; **INVESTIGATION DETAILS:** Several inconsistencies in AARS538&#39;s reports have led the investigative team to conlude that AARS538 is no longer fully under the Foundation&#39;s control. The reasons for these inconsistencies are currently unknown, and most likely result either from some outside interference or from internal corruption of the system&#39;s programming. 
&gt; The noted inconsistencies are as follows:
&gt; * //Only 17% of drone dispatches have been recorded in reports. This includes 29% of subtype-A events and 5% of subtype-T events.//
&gt; * //Only 35% of known terminations have been recorded in reports. This includes 12% of terminations involved in subtype-A events and 68% involved in subtype-T events.//
&gt; * //All 98 known terminations of Foundation staff by AARS538 have not been included in reports. This includes 75 individuals exposed to strains of SCP-3281, and 23 individuals linked to this investigation. This count excludes the 113 D-Class used in routine strain testing.//
&gt; * //The strain recorded as SCP-3281-A-e shows no memetic transmissability or other anomalous effects. SCP-3281-A-e describes an individual travelling to the nearest boat dealership, seeking out a customer service representative and making a request for a number of car batteries greater than 12.//
&gt; * //The strain recorded as SCP-3281-T-c shows no memetic transmissability or other anomalous effects. SCP-3281-T-c describes an individual seeking out an electric motor and an individual within 25 months of their own age, and bringing them to a secluded area before murdering and dismembering the other individual, and converting parts of their body into a handheld tattoo application device in combination with the electric motor. When finished, the individual uses this device to apply a tattoo to their own body and often the remains of the deceased individual.//
&gt; * //The strain recorded as SCP-3281-N-d has not shown any loss of anomalous properties, and AARS538 has been observed dispatching drones on three occasions in response to SCP-3281-N-d outbreaks since reporting it neutralized.//
&gt;
&gt; **INVESTIGATION CONCLUSION:** Due to infosecurity mechanisms inherent in AARS538, external reprogramming of the system or retrieval of the system&#39;s databases is not currently possible, and deactivation of AARS538 is not currently an option. The Foundation&#39;s priority as of now should be the creation of a backup Autonomic Analysis System to independently retrieve information regarding SCP-3281. Any independent investigation of AARS538 or SCP-3281 must be done through the Foundation&#39;s secure channels, to prevent AARS538 from responding to the investigation as a possible information breach.
