**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3939 is kept in a standard holding cell, no special measures are needed.

[[div class=&#34;story&#34;]]
You pack your things, leave the Site, head to the car park, drive out of the gate and make your way home. Traffic is heavy. There&#39;s been a crash, so you end up having to queue for over an hour. When you finally get home you&#39;re too stressed to cook anything, so you order a pizza from the place down the road, and then you go to bed.

In the morning, you get up, take a shower, piss, put on clothes, eat porridge, and leave. Traffic is heavy on the way to work, but the crash is gone, at least. You drive through the security checkpoint, get let in, park your car, and head to your office.

Less than a minute later — you&#39;ve not had time to mentally prepare yourself for today, even — there&#39;s a knock at your door. You open it up to see the face of Junior Researcher Sally Hawthorne.

&#34;Dr. ████████.&#34; she says.

&#34;Sally.&#34; you reply. &#34;Is... is everything okay?&#34;

&#34;Yes, sir, of course.&#34; The speed at which she speaks — as well as the fact that she&#39;s stood at your door in the first place — reveals her lie. &#34;Well, actually... have you seen Dr. Rodriguez today?&#34;

&#34;Carlos?&#34; You think back to the day before — you asking him to write your article, and what happened afterwards. &#34;Not since yesterday, no. Why do you ask?&#34;

&#34;He was supposed to be here an hour ago.&#34; She steps into your office completely, and pulls the door shut behind her. &#34;We had some work that needs doing. I&#39;ve not been able to contact him at all this morning.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;ve not heard from him, no.&#34; you reply, a little absentmindedly.

&#34;Okay. Thank you, doc.... ████.&#34; Sally says, as she backs out of your office and into the corridor, closing the door behind her.

You take a seat at your desk, and wonder what she needed to meet with him for. It takes you a moment to remember what you&#39;re supposed to be doing today. You&#39;ve got to take a closer look at SCP-3939 to see if you can work out what&#39;s actually anomalous about it. Your head sinks into your hands as the crushing thought of the sheer amount of work you&#39;ve got to do towers over you.
