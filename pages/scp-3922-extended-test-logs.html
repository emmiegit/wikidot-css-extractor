&gt; Subject: &lt;Video title&gt;, &lt;Date of release&gt;, &lt;MPAA rating, if any&gt;
&gt; Interference Point: &lt;Where, during the course of the video, SCP-3922 was introduced&gt; 
&gt; Result: &lt;Results&gt;
&gt; Note: &lt;Notes, if Any&gt;

------

**Subject:** //The Lion King//, 1994, G
**Interference Point:** Shortly before the stampede sequence in which Mufasa dies.
**Result:** Film proceeds as normal, save for the end credits including a note after the &#34;Special Thanks&#34; section: &#34;THIS NARRATIVE HAS BEEN FULLY INSPECTED BY ☽☽☽ AND WE ARE HAPPY TO REPORT THAT NO ILLEGAL HUNTING OF AFRICAN WILDLIFE HAS BEEN DETECTED.&#34;
**Note:** It is currently believed that societies that have no interactions with humanity are outside of SCP-3922-A jurisdiction.

**Subject:** //The Brave Little Toaster//, 1987, G
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** Film lasts for only ten minutes, beginning with an unidentified orbital energy weapon causing all human life to vanish from Earth during the opening. A drone analogous to the appearance of [[[SCP-2578]]]-D approaches the protagonist of the film, reporting that all sentient machines have been freed of their human slavers. This is met with mixed emotions from the film&#39;s primary cast, who were anxiously awaiting the return of &#34;the master&#34;.
**Note:** //I mean, they weren&#39;t technically// wrong... - Dr. Naismith

**Subject:** //Batman: The Killing Joke//, 2016, R
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** Film length extended to four hours. The story has been altered to portray in detail the Joker&#39;s public hanging, drawing, and quartering by SCP-3922-A, followed by the entire Gotham City supervillain rogues gallery turning themselves in, to the authorities out of fear. An animated simulacrum of comic book writer Alan Moore is then captured by instances SCP-3922-A, and, at gunpoint, addresses the viewer that the Joker is &#34;really, really, really, honestly, 110% perma-dead, will not come back, will not be resurrected, will not have his death retconned, has no backup plans, no machiavellian schemes to turn anyone else into his successor, and will not be missed, so if you&#39;re going to ask us to bring him back, //don&#39;t,// or suffer the consequences.&#34;

**Subject:** An episode of [[[SCP-993]]]
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** In a previously unaired episode titled &#34;Bobble Shoots for the Moon&#34;, the title character disables an instance of SCP-2578-D with a slingshot, then instructs the viewer on how to dismantle and reverse-engineer its various parts into a powerful energy weapon, which it then uses to disintegrate and torture several instances of SCP-3922-A that try to interfere.
**Note:** This is the first known occurrence of SCP-3922-A soldiers not succeeding.

**Subject:** //Space Jam//, 1996, PG
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** Film proceeds as a biographical drama of the life and career of basketball player Michael Jordan, with no involvement from cartoon characters. During a brief scene in a coffee shop, a mention is made by a side character of a peculiar news story about a corrupt intergalactic amusement park known as Moron Mountain being destroyed by instances of SCP-3922-A. Michael Jordan dismisses the news story as ridiculous.

**Subject:** //Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope//, 1977, PG
**Interference Point:** Shortly before the Death Star destroys Alderaan
**Result:** Shortly after Governor Tarkin says &#34;You may fire when ready,&#34; the Death Star Control Room is raided by SCP-3922-A instances, who proceed to massacre all Imperial staff in the area with high-powered energy rifles. Though they suffer considerable casualties in the effort to neutralize Darth Vader, one of the SCP-3922-A instances uses a grenade-like device labeled &#34;TACTICAL OFFENSIVE TELEPORTATION CHARGE&#34; on him, shifting the scene to [REDACTED] analogous to [[[SCP-2922]]]-[REDACTED] Impenetrable [REDACTED] analogous to creature puppetry typically seen in the Star Wars franchise [REDACTED] turned to stone and used as a war trophy by the ☽☽☽ Initiative. The film ends ten minutes later, as three crescent moon decals are painted on the side of the Death Star by SCP-2578-D instances.
**EMERGENCY ADDENDUM:** //I&#39;m putting a moratorium on further experimentation with Star Wars. The possibility that we just gave a previously-fictional superweapon to the ☽☽☽ Initiative cannot be ignored as a significant risk to our safety.// - Dr. Naismith

**Subject:** //Dragon Ball Z: Battle Of Gods//, 2013, PG
**Interference Point:** N/A
**Result:** N/A
**Note:** //Request denied. The possibility of a nonfictional group of interest enlisting the aid of planet-destroying humanoids poses even more of a risk than the Death Star. Even Yamcha would be a potential new Keter to worry about.// - Dr. Naismith

**Subject:** //Monty Python and the Holy Grail//, 1975, PG
**Interference Point:** Shortly after the initial onscreen appearance of King Arthur.
**Result:** King Arthur is hit by an Impaler Event from an SCP-2578-D instance shortly after appearing onscreen, following which a large number of SCP-3922-A instances arrive in dropships and announce a military occupation in order to &#34;bring an end to tyranny&#34;. This is followed by a short montage, in which the remaining knights are arrested on various charges, the Rabbit of Caerbannog is killed by a &#34;tactical holy smart bomb&#34;, and the historian is arrested for &#34;unlicensed time travel&#34;.  The film ends with a SCP-3922-A &#34;tactical health specialist&#34; arriving at the house of the unnamed animator and providing treatment for &#34;heart problems&#34;.

**Subject:** Music video for Judas Priest&#39;s &#34;Breaking The Law&#34;, 1980, Unrated
**Interference Point:** Shortly after Rob Halford opens the bank safe.
**Result:** Several SCP-3922-A instances enter the bank carrying submachine guns. The &#34;robbery&#34; itself is considered by the instances to have been staged, but the group is given a brief but stern talking-to about &#34;promotion of criminal values towards minors&#34;, after which the video ends.

**Subject:** //The Simpsons//, Season 4 Episode 12 &#34;Marge vs. the Monorail&#34;, TV-PG
**Interference Point:** After the characters finish singing the &#34;Monorail&#34; song.
**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances arrive in Springfield via helicopter and arrest conman Lyle Lanley for previously selling a faulty monorail to the city of North Haverbrook. SCP-3922-A instances then explain the nature of the monorail scam and announce they will be occupying the city of Springfield. Two &#34;Tactical Transportation Experts&#34; take over the monorail project and plan a legitimate mass transit system for Springfield. Over the course of the episode, well-known lawbreaking characters (Snake, Fat Tony, Sideshow Bob, etc.) are arrested by SCP-3922-A instances and sentenced to forced labour in the monorail construction. The episode ends with Lyle Lanley being tied to the train tracks and run over by the monorail during its opening ceremony; various characters are seen uncomfortably smiling aboard the train surrounded by SCP-3922-A instances as the episode ends.

**Subject:** Site 19 Cafeteria security footage. Of note is that at ██:██ PM, ████████ █████ (a member of the Foundation maintenance staff), was recorded smoking in direct violation of Foundation health and safety standards (█████ has since been reprimanded for this action). 
**Interference Point:** None.
**Result:** No changes from the original footage.
**Note:** SCP-3922 appears to have no effect on non-fictional recordings.

**Subject:** The Ballad of Smokes McGee,[[footnote]]A mockumentary produced for testing purposes by Dr. Edison, utilizing Site 19 Cafeteria security footage from the previous test. The movie consists of Dr. Edison narrating over footage of ████████ █████&#39;s smoke break, whom the narrator claims to be named &#34;Smokes McGee&#34;, admonishing him for his flagrant violation of Foundation health and safety standards. ████████ █████ signed an agreement allowing his likeness to be used in this manner, as well as █ unrelated personnel. All other personnel had their faces digitally blurred.[[/footnote]] Not Rated
**Interference Point:** 1 minute into the film, wherein the character of &#34;Smokes McGee&#34; (portrayed by ████████ █████) takes a smoke break, despite the narrator&#39;s insistence that doing so is a violation of Foundation protocols.
**Result:** Several SCP-3922-A instances burst into the room in full tactical gear. Security staff attempt to subdue the SCP-3922-A instances, only to be incapacitated by SCP-3922-A&#39;s energy weapons. The narrator expresses shock at this, wondering aloud what the &#34;three moons guys are doing here&#34;. He then continues to narrate the events that proceed, explaining that they have simply come to warn Smokes McGee about the dangers of smoking in a hazardous environment such as Site 19. The lead SCP-3922-A then confiscates and disposes of the offending cigarette, and informs Smokes McGee that this incident has already been reported to his supervisor.
**Note:** Assigning a fictional narrative to nonfictional footage appears to meet SCP-3922&#39;s criteria for &#34;fiction&#34;.

**Subject:** //The Spongebob Squarepants Movie//, 2004, PG
**Interference Point:** When Plankton attempts to steal King Neptune&#39;s Crown.
**Result:** Movie continues as normal until the point where SpongeBob and Patrick meet the cyclops.[[footnote]]Shown later in the movie to be a diver working at Shell City, a tourist trap, collecting sea creatures to repurpose as knickknacks to sell.[[/footnote]] Two SCP-3922-A instances wearing scuba gear promptly arrest the cyclops under 55 accounts of illegal hunting. The film then cuts to Shell City, where several SCP-3922-A instances repossess all inventory in the store. David Hasselhoff, a witness to the event, is brought in for questioning.

**Subject:** Live recording of production of Shakespeare&#39;s //Macbeth// by D-class personnel, not rated
**Interference Point:** None, test canceled  
**Result:** None, test canceled
**Note:** //No. The risk of introducing SCP-3922-A to the current timeline is too great. All live testing is suspended until further notice. Also, I know we&#39;re not superstitious here, but let&#39;s stay away from &#34;the Scottish play,&#34; just the same. No sense of inviting trouble when we have many other options.//-- Dr. Willis

**Subject:** &#34;Scott Tenorman Must Die&#34;, //South Park// episode, 2001, TV-MA
**Interference Point:** Before Cartman explains his plans in the final scene.
**Result:** The contest is interrupted by SCP-3922-A instances who arrive in FBI Granger-style vehicles, accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Tenorman. Cartman is arrested on over 30 different charges, such as attempted murder, scamming, racial discrimination, threats, and other various crimes. Scott Tenorman, along with the rest of the crowd and the arriving band of Radiohead, is then informed that Cartman attempted to kill Mr. and Mrs. Tenorman by tricking them into trespassing onto a trigger-happy farmer&#39;s property, where they would be shot and killed, afterward being chopped up and served as chili - to the disgust of everyone present. Scott is told off with a warning for bullying Cartman, whereas Cartman is carried away to jail; he is then seen being executed by [REDACTED]. The episode&#39;s final scene switches to an animated representation of Comedy Central headquarters where animated characters of show creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker are scolded by an SCP-3922-A instance, condemning their &#39;actions upon the townsfolk of South Park&#39;. They are both then terminated by an instance of an Impaler Event of SCP-2578-D.

**Subject:** //The Human Centipede// (First Sequence), 2009 (unrated)
**Interference Point:** Entire film
**Result:** Entire film is replaced with a title screen consisting of the word &#34;ongeschikt&#34;.[[footnote]]Dutch for &#34;unsuitable.&#34;[[/footnote]] This appears onscreen for four minutes, then the film ends.
**Note:** After further audio inspection, shouts from SCP-3922-A and screams of pain from Josef Heiter are present throughout the film. In the last 30 seconds, the voice of Dutch movie director Tom Six is also heard, pleading for mercy and forgiveness; two gunshots then silence both individuals. 

**Subject:** //Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring//, 2001, PG-13
**Interference Point:** End of the battle on the slopes of Mount Doom
**Result:** Instance of SCP-3922-A prevents Isildur from using his father&#39;s sword to cut the One Ring from Sauron&#39;s hand.  Sauron&#39;s lifeless body is buried in a civil ceremony, and the question of ownership of the One Ring is referred to the probate office in the relevant lawful jurisdiction.

**Subject:** Full recording of Researcher Tranh&#39;s playthrough of //BioShock Infinite//
**Interference Point:** Beginning of the game
**Result:** The opening dialogue, delivered over a black screen, is replaced with audio of main character Booker DeWitt struggling and drowning. The video then cuts to a pixelated version of the Three Moons symbol, underneath similarly-styled text reading: &#34;WINNERS DON&#39;T USE TEARS! SAY NO TO TIMELINE POLLUTION! [REDACTED], CHRONOSPATIAL PROTECTION AGENCY, ☽☽☽&#34;. This lasts until the end credits, which are played over silence.

**Subject:** A three-hour recording containing only the cutscenes of //Bioshock Infinite//
**Interference Point:** Beginning of the game
**Result:** Same as the previous test, with the timing of the end credits matching that of the source video.

**Subject:** //The Sopranos//, Season 5 Episode 13 &#34;All Due Respect&#34;, TV-MA, as recorded on [[[SCP-2614]]]
**Interference Point:** N/A
**Result:** N/A
**Note:** //We do not usually record denials on experiment logs, but Dr. Schmidt and myself feel the need to be abundantly clear in our response: **over our cold, dead bodies.**//-- Director Naismith

**Subject:** [[[SCP-2835]]]
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** The video begins without the usual opening sequence. SCP-2835-1 addresses the viewer directly, sobbing and visibly intoxicated, and yelling &#34;Naismith, you goddamn snitching swiss cheese-eating //whore!//&#34; and variations thereof. A poorly-drawn SCP-3922-A instance in the background approaches, saying &#34;Let&#39;s go, Paddy. We&#39;re only trying to help.&#34; SCP-2835-1 attempts suicide with a shotgun blast to the face, only to become mildly dazed, with stars circling his head. Video ends.
**Note:** Testing of SCP-2835 afterward, without the influence of SCP-3922, consisted of SCP-2835-1 spending the entirety of the video lamenting its inability to &#34;people die, not just cartoon die.&#34; 

**Subject:** //Nineteen Eighty-Four// (1984), R
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** The film is extended to be 18 hours long, with a large army of SCP-3922-A invading and occupying Airstrip One. At 17 hours, all the Inner Party members, including Big Brother, are executed by SCP-3922-A instances via gunfire. An SCP-3922-A instance holds a speech in Victory Square, where they announce the occupation of the British Isles and the return of liberty and justice to the people of Great Britain and Ireland. They then prepare to invade the rest of the world; a montage of SCP-3922-A instances invade the rest of Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia, where their leaders are executed. The film ends with Winston Smith meeting Julia and presumably falling in love.

**Subject:** A chronological recording of cutscenes from //The Binding Of Isaac: Afterbirth+//, 2017, M (ESRB)
**Interference Point:** Cutscene 20
**Result:** The chest is opened to reveal an exhausted, emaciated Isaac, who looks up to see two SCP-3922-A instances scooping him out of his would-be tomb. A montage follows, chronicling Isaac being fed, given medical attention, and eventually thriving in a 3922-A-supervised foster home, while his mother is apprehended and subjected to an agonizing but ultimately effective regimen of in-patient psychotherapy. The last scene ends with Isaac in his mother&#39;s hospital room, the two of them hugging and smiling tearfully.
**Note:** On the day following this test, //Binding of Isaac// creator Edmund McMillen reported having had &#34;the most wonderful dream&#34; on his Twitter account, and reporting that the world felt &#34;just a little brighter&#34;.

**Subject:** Gameplay of new final boss from //The Binding of Isaac: Repentance//, 2021, M (ESRB)
**Interference Point:** Home level.
**Result:** The player opens the hidden closet with the Red Key item to find their &#34;Tainted&#34; counterpart replaced with an instance of SCP-3922-A. The player interacts with the 3922-A instance who spawns a single Pedestal Item and disappears from the room, similar to the various beggars found throughout the game. The gameplay then proceeds as normal until the Beast fight, where several more SCP-3922-A instances are seen assisting Isaac in the fight with firearms. After the Beast&#39;s death, Isaac&#39;s ascent in the usual cutscene is replaced with visions of events similar to the previous testing, albeit now with the additional presence of his father, who is also subjected to psychotherapy. The narrator then reveals himself to be Isaac&#39;s Father, whom Isaac is visiting in the hospital room.

**Subject:** //The Last of Us: Story Version//, a YouTube video containing every cutscene from the 2013 video game //The Last of Us// (Rated M), excluding the &#34;Left Behind&#34; prequel DLC.
**Interference Point:** After Joel steps out of his apartment in the Boston quarantine zone. 
**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances invade the quarantine zone via armor and infantry storming the main entrance gate; city personnel surrender after two hours of intense fighting. Ellie is located by an SCP-3922-A instance, who uses an unknown medical device to extract the cure to the cordyceps infection while leaving her unharmed; meanwhile, Joel and Tess are arrested by other instances for smuggling unauthorized items into the quarantine zone. After developing the vaccine and inoculating everyone in the area, the remaining five hours show SCP-3922-A instances traveling across the post-apocalyptic landscape and terminating any infected or hostile survivors they find (the hunter-controlled Pittsburgh quarantine zone is obliterated via firebombing). The end of the video shows SCP-3922-A instances arriving at the Firefly headquarters in Salt Lake City and informing them that their &#34;unlawful actions will no longer be tolerated in restored civil society&#34;, implying they will attempt to bring all of the former United States under their control with their dissemination of the cure to the infection.

**Subject:** //La Jetée//, 1962, Not Rated
**Interference Point:** None.
**Result:** End credits are replaced with the phrase &#34;☽☽☽ WE WILL FIND A WAY IN ☽☽☽&#34;
**Note:** //Do not test this again. Let&#39;s be more careful about testing abstract narratives in the future.// - Dr. Naismith

**Subject:** //Metropolis//, 1927, Not Rated
**Interference Point:** During the scene in which the Robot Maria entices the Workers to rebellion.
**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances enter the area where the workers are congregated. The SCP-3922-A instances restrain and deactivate the Robot Maria, which puts up no resistance. The remaining Workers are forcibly dispersed, and the film cuts to SCP-3922-A arresting C.A. Rotwang for crimes including “kidnapping, assault, and the unlicensed creation of an artificial intelligence”, and Joh Fredersen is mentioned to have been deposed and imprisoned for “violation of multiple labor laws”. Both Maria and several members of the Workers receive fines for “inciting rebellion”, and the film ends 20 minutes early with the announcement that SCP-3922-A will be temporarily occupying Metropolis until civil order can be restored.
**Note:** All dialogue for the SCP-3922-A instances is rendered as intertitles, in the style of the original film.

**Subject:** //Sharknado//, 2013, Not Rated
**Interference Point:** [[[spc-2922|SPC-3922-A]]] first appears during the freeway scene, saving George.
**Result:** SPC-3922-A are armed with boxing gloves instead of usual armaments. After the freeway scene, a SPC-3922-A instance will appear whenever a shark would bite someone. The instance will punch the shark. Punched sharks suffer no serious injuries, but usually swim out of the scene, rather than attacking. End credits include the statement &#34;All sharks punched by ARMÁ ORÚN.&#34; 

**Subject:** //Mr. Rogers&#39; Neighborhood//, 1970 episode, TV-G
**Interference Point:** At the beginning of the &#34;Land of Make-Believe&#34; segment
**Result:** Several puppet characters remark on the suspicious absence of Lady Elaine Fairchilde and the disappearance of her Museum-Go-Round. An instance of SCP-3922-A enters, carrying Lady Elaine&#39;s magical Boomerang-Toomerang-Zoomerang in a semitransparent containment capsule labeled &#34;TACTICAL DEZOOMERANGIFICATION MATRIX&#34;. The instance explains to King Friday that Lady Elaine &#34;has to move away for a while on business, but she wishes you all the best.&#34; The rest of the episode proceeds without SCP-3922-A interference. 
**Note:** Further review of the SCP-3922-altered footage at altered volumes revealed muffled sounds of a hostile gunfire exchange in the distance, along with the phrase //&#34;Ya couldn&#39;t leave well enough alone, could ya, you Corbenese sons of--&#34;// from Lady Elaine, interrupted by an explosion before the expletive.

**Subject:** //WCW Bash At The Beach// 1996, Unrated (professional wrestling)
**Interference Point:** After the conclusion of the main event
**Result:** The climax of the show proceeds as normal, with Hulk Hogan entering the ring to attack his presumptive allies and join forces with &#34;outsiders&#34; Scott Hall and Kevin Nash. As Hulk Hogan is delivering his famous &#34;new world order of wrestling&#34; speech to a rain of audience garbage, interviewer &#34;Mean&#34; Gene Okerlund deviates from his recorded questions and instead says, &#34;Hulk, I&#39;m sorry to have to say this, and I hope one day we can be friends again, but in WCW, there&#39;s only //one// order we respect.&#34; A brass-heavy theme plays in the arena, and ten unarmed SCP-3922-A instances emerge from the locker room entrance, marching towards the ring to thunderous applause from the audience and joyous exhortations from play-by-play commentator Tony Schiavone. Three instances recover the beaten Sting, Lex Luger, and Randy Savage, and assist them (as well as a visibly-crestfallen Okerlund) to the backstage area, while the others storm the ring to attack the newly-formed &#34;New World Order&#34;. The SCP-3922-A instances conduct themselves as if they were extremely powerful wrestlers, obeying narrative conventions such as rebounding off the ring ropes when slung towards them by the &#34;Irish Whip&#34; maneuver. Nash and Hall are quickly overwhelmed by the SCP-3922-A assault, though Hogan manages to fight off four of the instances for several minutes before being rendered unconscious. The three are carried backstage for processing, while Schiavone celebrates &#34;the inevitable hand of all justice&#34;, and the camera pans out over the crowd, where more SCP-3922-A instances can be seen handing citations for littering to numerous audience members.
**Note:** Color commentator Bobby Heenan does not speak for this entire sequence. Camera shots of the announcer&#39;s desk show Heenan sitting in anxious silence as an SCP-3922-A instance stands behind him, arms crossed.
//Further testing with professional wrestling recordings shows that 3922-A instances win their battles almost instantly, with the only competitors able to put up a fight being those who had significant creative influence over the product at the time, e.g. Hogan in mid-1990s WCW, Triple H in mid-2000s WWE, and El Santo in his entire EMLL run.[[footnote]]To date, El Santo holds the only pinfall victory over any 3922-A instance.[[/footnote]]// - Researcher Tranh

**Subject:**  //Barney the Dinosaur//, 1997 episode, TV-G
**Interference Point:** Start of episode
**Result:** The episode begins with Barney standing on an empty set with no other characters present. The actor inside the suit removes the headpiece revealing an SCP-3922-A instance. The instance then rotates a nearby whiteboard around with the following message.
 &#34;Is the Foundation staffed by five-year-olds?  Playing this episode in the hopes of watching us vaporize Barney is inappropriate, to say the least. Act befitting your station or playtime is over.&#34;
 The episode then comes to an end with the Three Moon sign on the screen.
 //They do have a point, I suggest we ease up on the kid cartoons and shows. -Researcher Maytus//

**Subject:** CCTV recording of a 24-year-old man smoking a marijuana cigar (&#34;blunt&#34;) outside of his Sacramento, California apartment on 9 Feb 2018.[[footnote]]To meet SCP-3922&#39;s criteria for fiction as established in the &#34;Smokes McGee&#34; test, a fictional narration for the footage and a false name (&#34;Adrian Smith&#34;) for the individual were used.[[/footnote]] At the time of the footage and at present, consumption of recreational marijuana is legal in the state of California, but remains illegal under federal law as per the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.
**Interference Point:** After the man finishes smoking and puts out the marijuana cigar by pressing it against the concrete. 
**Result:** A single SCP-3922-A instance armed with an M16 rifle approaches the man, addressing him as &#34;Mr. Smith.&#34; After the man expresses alarm, the instance explains that it is only there to inform the man that smoking marijuana is a violation of federal law and to dispose of his cigar in the nearby dumpster. When the man replies that consumption is legal under state law, the instance hands him a small piece of paper and explains that the Three Moons Initiative is currently &#34;conflicted as to what action to take in this circumstance&#34; and that he will not face legal consequences as a result. The instance then reminds the man that littering is illegal under California law and to always dispose of his discarded smoking materials in proper trash receptacles after extinguishing them before walking away. 
**Note:** Conflicting laws appear to produce an uncertain and/or confused response from SCP-3922-A.

**Subject:** //Final Fantasy Tactics//, 1997, T (ESRB) (full playthrough recorded)
**Interference Point:** Opening cutscene
**Result:** Ovelia opens the scene by saying &#34;☽☽☽, please help us sinful children of Ivalice&#34;. Then, the screen scrolls down to reveal Agrias, Ramza, and Delita in the monastery with her, all wearing a helmetless variant of SCP-3922-A armor. Agrias waxes enthusiastic about the Order of the Three Moons, who arrived one year prior and swiftly placed Ivalice under martial law, pursuant to exterminating the &#34;Lucavi infestation&#34;. Other topics discussed by the three include the mass-arrest of the Corpse Brigade, the ongoing recovery of Ramza&#39;s father, and concern as to how their friend Algus is handling the execution of Marquis Elmdor. Then, two more SCP-3922-A instances enter and remove their helmets, revealing themselves to be Wiegraf and Miluda Folles. The siblings politely inform the others that it is time to escort Ovelia home and begin patrol. The rest of the recording resembles basic gameplay, with the party of five traveling around the map and occasionally fighting parties of archaeodemons, implied to be the remnants of some brief, massive struggle. All five characters have the class &#34;☽☽☽ Knight&#34; and use battlefield-spanning attacks like &#34;Pacifica Gun&#34; and &#34;All-Holy2&#34; to dispatch their foes swiftly. There are no further cutscenes.

**Interference Point:** After Jesse Pinkman calls Skinny Pete a second time and learns that the latter is unable to find where he and Walt are stranded in the desert. 
**Result:** Two helicopters with the Three Moons insignia on them approach Jesse, Walt, and the RV from a distance. After touching down, four SCP-3922-A instances emerge from a helicopter, two of which immediately arrest Jesse and Walt for manufacturing a controlled substance. The other two inspect the meth lab inside the RV and confiscate the recently created product. After being treated for dehydration, Jesse and Walt are transported to the Albuquerque Metropolitan Detention Center as an SCP-3922-A instance calls a disbelieving Hank Schrader and informs him that his brother-in-law is Heisenberg. The remainder of the episode depicts the consequences of Walt&#39;s public exposure: Hank angrily interrogates an arrogant and defiant Walt, resulting in the two nearly coming to blows. Starting at the halfway point of the episode, a separate subplot chronicles Saul Goodman&#39;s law firm being shut down for his illegal activities, though Saul himself manages to evade capture by either SCP-3922-A instances or the police and vanishes from Albuquerque. The closing shot of the episode depicts Walt coldly staring at a conflicted Hank through his prison cell doors after delivering a monologue in which he revealed his role in the death of Tuco Salamanca. 
**Note:** Gus Fring, Mike Ehrmantraut, and other law-breaking characters introduced later in the series are absent from the episode and apparently remain undetected by SCP-3922-A.

**Interference Point:** The day before the festival, right after Sayori&#39;s confession.
**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances appeared as character sprites just before the day is supposed to fade out, signaling the end of the scene. Dialog is consistent with vocalizations made in previous tests. A series of scenes from the main character&#39;s point of view show SCP-3922-A stopping Sayori&#39;s suicide attempt and placing her in therapy, arresting Natsuki&#39;s father on charges of child abuse and neglect and transferring the aforementioned girl to a foster care system, confiscating Yuri&#39;s knife collection and admitting her to a mental hospital, and using weapons marked as &#34;CODE ERSR&#34; to quickly dispatch Monika. The end card then immediately fades onto the screen, displaying the message &#34;Feel better.&#34;
**Notes:** Acts 2, 3, and 4 are completely absent through the use of SCP-3922.

**Interference Point:** The first scene at the office, wherein the unnamed main character meets his love interest. 
**Result:** The cognitohazardous mural in the background of the scene has been painted over by a non-hazardous mural featuring the &#34;☽☽☽&#34; symbol. Other cognitohazardous images have been similarly censored throughout the movie. The plot proceeds as normal.

**Interference Point:** After Jimmy McGill (Saul Goodman) and Tuco Salamanca shake hands in agreement on the skateboarding twins&#39; punishment for insulting Tuco&#39;s grandmother. 
**Result:** Before Tuco has a chance to break the twins&#39; legs, a helicopter similar to the one seen in the previous //Breaking Bad// test approaches the scene. Tuco is executed via a long-range sniper rifle shot to the head; No-Doze and Gonzo are killed and Nacho is seriously injured as they return fire. After the helicopter touches down, an SCP-3922-A instance begins treating Nacho for his gunshot wounds while other instances interrogate Jimmy and the skateboarders. Although initially planning to arrest all three of them for &#34;financially motivated confidence scams,&#34; Jimmy successfully persuades the 3922-A instances to not take any action, arguing that he saved the twins from a worse punishment from Tuco and that they are &#34;so scared of you that they won&#39;t even think about jaywalking for the rest of their lives&#34;. Additionally, he claims his attempted scam of the Kettlemans was &#34;my homage to Robin Hood&#34; and that he planned to donate their embezzled money to a local charity after stealing it. The 3922-A instances let all three of them off with a stern warning to &#34;refrain from any future criminal activities, even with altruistic motivations&#34; and exit the scene after loading Nacho into the helicopter via a stretcher. 
**Notes:** No SCP-3922-A instances demonstrate recollection of the previous //Breaking Bad// test. Additionally, this marks the first known occurrence of 3922-A instances reneging on their planned punishment after persuasion from a character.

**Result:** Two SCP-3922-A instances armed with advanced weaponry raid the hotel room and arrest Bird before she can shoot Roy, who is horrified to learn of her actual intentions when they are explained to him by the instances. After Bird is placed in a psychiatric hospital, the remainder of the film depicts Roy&#39;s successful career as a pitcher for the Chicago Cubs. In the end, he throws a perfect game to close out a World Series win over the New York Yankees, striking out &#34;The Whammer&#34; (a stand-in for Babe Ruth) for the 27th and final out.

**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances, possessing full knowledge of the maze&#39;s structure through unknown means, establish communication with Chiaki through an earpiece (absent in the original), guiding her as she navigates the maze and warning her of any traps. The screen in which Class 77-B is watching Chiaki&#39;s torture is destroyed by gunshot, and other SCP-3922-A instances storm the room they are in to rescue them, while Junko Enoshima and Mukuro Ikusaba are terminated with extreme prejudice by sniper fire.

**Result:** During the course of the film, instances of SCP-3922-A are seen in the background, hidden from the characters, including the omnipresent Ghosts of Past, Present, and Future. Before the end credits, as Scrooge sits at his desk, an instance of SCP-3922-A approaches him, holding a letter. After a cry of alarm from Scrooge, he reluctantly accepts it. The SCP-3922-A instance then leaves the room. After Scrooge opens the letter, the camera cuts to its contents, which detail that while Scrooge&#39;s actions were legal, the morality of said actions prompted them to observe and eventually capture him. However, due to recent events coming to light, the arrest was called off, in favor of &#34;letting you redeem yourself, you&#39;ve suffered enough as it is.&#34; The film ends with the camera zooming in on the &#34;☽☽☽&#34; signature at the bottom of the letter.
**Note:** Morals appear to play a factor in determining if instances of SCP-3922-A will carry out the arrest and punishment for an individual&#39;s crimes, even if they are considered legal.

Human SCP-3922-A instances are holding the man at gunpoint while their leader collects the bottle of glue and Lord Business Minifigure, explaining to The Man Upstairs that the toy is a tyrant who is to be punished for his crimes. SCP-3922-A instances then exit. The Man Upstairs expresses extreme confusion about the events.
**Note:** We don&#39;t really understand what happened, but the unaltered version of the movie wasn&#39;t much clearer.

**Result:** The girl in the video is tapped on the shoulder by an SCP-3922-A instance to her surprise, causing her to remove her headphones which stops the music. Out of shot, the SCP-3922-A instance briefly lectures the girl on the dangers of prolonged work, telling her that while studying is important, doing so for such lengthy periods of time can be hazardous to one&#39;s physical and mental health. The remainder of the video stays on a shot of the girl&#39;s empty desk while quiet snoring and rainfall can be heard in the background.

After being informed of their destination at the Valley Lodge, they direct them to an alternate route that will get them there more quickly. The remainder of the film is dedicated to the SCP-3922-A instances assaulting the compound where The Master&#39;s cult resides. The Master is seen using several anomalous abilities which would have been impossible to render with film technology circa 1966 but is eventually shot in the medulla by a sniper using beryllium-bronze rounds. Torgo is taken into custody, and the Master&#39;s wives are all freed. The final scene shows the family enjoying their vacation at the Valley Lodge.

**Interference Point:** During the invention exchange.
**Result:** Several instances of SCP-3922-A enter Deep 13 and apprehend Dr. Forrester and TV&#39;s Frank; the equipment used by these instances, while identical in function, appears to have been adjusted to fit the hand-made aesthetic of much of the show&#39;s props. On the Satellite of Love, Joel Robinson, Tom Servo, and Crow appear confused as a ship piloted by SCP-3922-A instances appear on Rocket #9&#39;s camera. The instances offer to return them to the Gizmonic Institute. Joel and the bots agree they want to riff on the film, even if they are not being forced to do so. The episode largely proceeds as normal (with the first Host Segment after the film starts being replaced with Joel and the bots expressing confusion as to the nature of the SCP-3922-A instances), with no changes to the version of //Manos: the Hands of Fate// playing within this episode.

The film switches to show Hell&#39;s Gate being destroyed by a nuclear explosion. The film then shows a scene in a classroom revealing that the previous events were part of a history lesson being taught by an SCP-3922-A instance. The SCP-3922-A instance explains that shortly after the Resources Development Administration was forcibly shut down, scientists discovered a new type of environmentally clean room-temperature superconductor that could be created on earth much more cheaply than unobtainium could be shipped from other planets. The SCP-3922-A instance notes that afterward humans and Na&#39;vi had lived peacefully with no further conflicts of any sort happening between them. The film abruptly ends.

An SCP-3922-A sniper tags the Behelit with a magnetic charge labeled &#34;BEHELITIC INTERFERENCE ORDINANCE.&#34; The Behelit forms a smiling face that proudly sings the opening lines of //Homo Sapiens Invcitus// (Anthem of the ☽☽☽ Initiative), causing Griffith to disappear. SCP-3922-A troops forcibly escort the remaining members of the Band of the Hawk to safety. The leader of the detachment, identifying herself as General Spiegel, offers a statement to the bewildered survivors: &#34;Provisional aid will be supplied for the time being, however, more time will be needed to prepare for wider-scale corrective action in Midland and the surrounding jurisdictions, on the grounds that -- pardon my Kushan -- I have no fucking idea where to start with this hellhole.&#34;  
**Note:** The DVD of the episode included a special &#34;Deleted Scenes&#34; section, along with a new scene labeled &#34;Dinner with the Kids,&#34; consisting of a six-hour cut of JALAKÅRA feeding Griffith to several thousand unidentified arachnoid entities.

**Interference Point:** Beginning of the recording
**Result:** A small group of SCP-3922-A instances appear at the Gate of Alchemy where they encounter ‘Truth’, an omnipotent being in the show. Confused at first, the instances approach the entity and ask why they have arrived there instead of their chosen destination. Truth proceeds to explain that all set events occurring in its reality are governed by strict laws of exchange,[[footnote]]Reflecting the show&#39;s major themes of &#39;equivalent exchange&#39; regarding the rules of Alchemy[[/footnote]] and that even if they were to prevent harm from occurring, this would ensure that equal suffering and injustice would transpire elsewhere, ultimately making their efforts pointless. The scene then cuts to the instances leaving, appearing dissatisfied.
**Note:** Testing with the original 2003 episode produced near-identical results.

The camera cuts to Fathers Ted and Dougal outside, running from the house as Father Jack is heard loudly exclaiming &#34;FECK OFF!&#34; Two instances of SCP-3922-A are subsequently hurled out the living room window, and signs of a violent struggle from within the house are obvious. After ten minutes, all five instances - one of which is carrying a bottle of whiskey - leave the house, in various states of disarray and heavily wounded, pursued by an enraged Father Jack. Episode length is extended to over three hours, during which Craggy Island is occupied by SCP-3922-A instances in increasing numbers, who conduct a manhunt for Father Jack. John and Mary O&#39;Leary are arrested for repeated attempted murder, and Father Ted is investigated on suspicion of illegal activities but cleared of charges. After this, both Dougal and Ted meagerly protest the occupation with the placards bearing the phrases &#34;CAREFUL NOW&#34; and &#34;DOWN WITH THIS SORT OF THING.&#34;[[footnote]]Identical to the ones depicted in &#34;The Passion of Saint Tibulus&#34;[[/footnote]] At the end of the episode, the commander of the SCP-3922-A instances is shown in the house, investigating Father Jack&#39;s room. Upon finding several bottles of whiskey which are ordered confiscated, Father Jack is heard shouting &#34;GET THE FECK AWAY FROM MY DRINK!&#34; before crashing through the upper window and viciously assaulting the SCP-3922-A instances. It is unknown what the outcome of the engagement was.

However, once Becker confronts Lutze and closes the gates, SCP-3922-A ceases attempts and instead watches the events and were even observed to unfold seats and exchange popcorn, with no other interference, save for jeering at Lutze when he tried to leave the camp. At the end of the credits, the following message was produced: &#34;THE TRIAL AND SENTENCING OF CAPTAIN GUNTHER LUTZE HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE ☽☽☽ INITIATIVE!&#34;

**Subject:** //Robert Novak&#39;s Car Accident//, 2019, Not Rated. A Foundation-made dramatization of the life of political columnist Robert Novak (1931-2009), focusing on the 2008 incident in which Novak did not stop after having struck a pedestrian with his car; two days later, as a direct result of this incident, physicians examined Novak and discovered that he had a malignant brain tumor which was interfering with his vision.
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** As Novak prepares to leave his home on the morning of the incident, he is intercepted by five armed instances of SCP-3922-A, who confiscate his car keys and explain that his friends and relatives are concerned about his health and safety. The instances lead Novak through a series of field neurological tests, at the end of which a weeping Novak concedes that his ability to process visual input is no longer sufficient to enable him to drive safely. The instances then deliver Novak to a local hospital for diagnosis and treatment. Novak tells them that &#34;just because you helped me doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to let you get away with anything,&#34; then promises to investigate them and expose any corruption he finds; the instances tell him that they would welcome this. A montage then depicts scenes from the next 13 months of Novak&#39;s life: unsuccessful medical procedures, reconciliations with political and professional foes, and the publication of his final column, in which he reluctantly states that he was unable to find any evidence of malfeasance from &#34;those Three Moons bastards&#34;.

**Note:** //No, no, and again no. As amusing as this would be, let&#39;s be clear: Deadpool as a character is aware of the fourth wall. He knows he&#39;s in a narrative. SCP-3922 invades narratives. I don&#39;t want to even risk giving someone as psychotic as Wade Wilson the ability to travel between narratives. Yes, I know about Deadpool: Killustrated, but that was written with the express purpose of exploring said concept. This, on the other hand, runs the risk of giving a self-aware character free will. And that could only ever result in pure and utter chaos.// - Director Naismith.

**Subject:** Music video for &#34;We Are Number One,&#34; a song from the children&#39;s television show &#34;LazyTown.&#34;
**Interference Point:** When Robbie Rotten, disguised as an elderly woman, gives Sportacus an apple.
**Result:** Two SCP-3922-A instances arrive.  One apprehends and arrests Robbie Rotten, and the other confiscates the apple and explains to Sportacus that the apple would have rendered him unconscious, allowing Robbie and his cohorts to capture him.  More SCP-3922-A instances arrive, having detained Bobbie, Tobbie, and Flobbie[[footnote]]The three Robbie Rotten lookalikes featured in the video.[[/footnote]]. Throughout this exchange, the instrumental for the song continues playing.  How the apple would have been able to render Sportacus unconscious is unmentioned, and Robbie is only arrested for attempted kidnapping.
**Note:** Perhaps the music video was sufficiently edited so that SCP-3922 considered it a separate narrative from &#34;Robbie&#39;s Dream Team&#34; and the rest of &#34;LazyTown.&#34;

**Subject:** A recording of //Toy Story 2//, 1999.  This recording was taken in a room that was decorated to appear as a movie theater, with Foundation personnel playing the roles of the patrons.
**Interference Point:** Beginning of the film.
**Result:** An instance of SCP-3922-A steps in front of the personnel holding the camera, confiscates it, reminds him that recording in a movie theater is illegal, and turns off the camera.
**Note:** SCP-3922 seemed to consider the recording of //Toy Story 2// as the narrative, rather than the plot of the movie being recorded.

&gt; //SCP-3922-A does as instructed. Mel Brooks proceeds to face the camera and holds up a document, revealing the signatories of several individuals, including the Founder of the Foundation.//[[footnote]]Analysis has confirmed it to be genuine.[[/footnote]]
&gt;

&gt; //Brooks turns to the SCP-3922-A instances//
&gt; 
&gt; **Brooks:** You&#39;re all free to go!

**Subject:** Justin Timberlake&#39;s &#34;//TKO//&#34; music video, 2013, Explicit lyrics
**Interference Point:** Nearing the end of the video.
**Result:** While Justin Timberlake is dragged through the sand by a car, several SCP-3922-A instances ran after it, and when the girl bailed out of the car, one instance of SCP-3922-A jumped into the car then turned off the engine, then the other instances of SCP-3922-A untied the rope then picked up Justin Timberlake to take him back to safety. The one instance of SCP-3922-A turned the engine back on then jumped out of the car, following the other SCP-3922-A instances; the video continues normally with the car getting off the cliff.

**Subject:** A recording of a playthrough of //Pokémon Red//, 1997, E (ESRB).
**Interference Point:** Mt. Moon
**Result:** Instead of Team Rocket Grunts, there are now sprites resembling SCP-3922-A. Said individuals do not fight Red, instead only offering advice to the player that in real life they should not partake in animal cruelty, and avoid behavior featured in the game such as wandering in remote locations without proper equipment. Later in the game, it is made clear that SCP-3922-A have taken down Team Rocket, with cities that had a heavy presence of said crime syndicate such as Celadon, Saffron, and Lavender being placed under martial law, and leader Giovanni being replaced in the Viridian City Gym with a man named Paolo. The Game Corner which hid Team Rocket&#39;s headquarters has been replaced with an ☽☽☽ Initiative Laboratory, featuring a gift shop offering the same Pokémon that could be won at the original game and posters against gambling. New battles are found in Cerulean City - the burgled house, which has not been ransacked, features a trainer who upon defeat gives TM28 - and the Pokémon Tower - with the Marowak mother never murdered, she, along with her Cubone son, is instead being trained by Mr. Fuji. The guards who opened the gates to Saffron by being bribed with drinks are seen in a prison building, and Trainers of the Burglar class cannot be found in the game. Another major difference is that the game only features 150 Pokémon, ending with Mew - who can be captured at Cerulean Cave - because, as revealed once Red discovers a still-intact Pokémon Mansion that serves as a four-floor Cinnabar Gym, SCP-3922-A shut down the illegal genetic experiments that created Mewtwo.

**Result:** A still image of ☽☽☽ Initiative logo covered the screen, with the phrase //Lasciate ogni speranza voi ch&#39;entrate//[[footnote]] Italian for &#39;Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.&#39; [[/footnote]] underneath. Examination of audio revealed there to be retching, gunfire, sobbing, and various people speaking and yelling in Italian. Several still frames were found upon examination of the footage, depicting [REDACTED]. At the end of the film, a recording of the trial of director Deodato is played, though all civil servants are replaced by instances of SCP-3922-A. Deodato is cleared of murder charges but later found guilty of animal cruelty. As punishment, he is subjected to [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Subject:** //Star Trek: Voyager,// Season 2, Episode 24 (&#34;Tuvix&#34;)
**Interference Point:** Shortly before Captain Janeway sends Tuvix to the transporter room to be separated into his component individuals.
**Result:** Six (6) armed SCP-3922-A instances &#39;materialize&#39; aboard Voyager&#39;s bridge with the same transporter effect used in the series. The ship&#39;s Red Alert is activated. The bridge crew is apprehended after a brief shootout with the SCP-3922-A instances, notably fainting dramatically upon being hit instead of vaporizing as expected from a high-powered energy rifle. Captain Janeway is imprisoned for attempted murder on a planet the narrator refers to as Corbenic.[[footnote]]The painted styrofoam rocks, among other set design elements, indicate this is not the real Corbenic[[/footnote]] Tuvix continues his combined duties aboard Voyager, with Chakotay becoming acting Captain. The SCP-3922 end title card&#39;s slogan is replaced with &#34;The ends do not justify the means.&#34;
**Note:** This is the first instance of the ☽☽☽ Initiative&#39;s home planet being depicted, albeit fictitiously.

**Result:** As Dan Backslide approaches Dora, a SCP-3922-A instance comes onto the screen and prepares to apprehend him, only for the action to pause as the old man in a one-piece bathing suit passes by. Once he exits, Dan proceeds to grab Dora and pulls both her and the tree into the car, only to later return to pry Dora from the tree once he realizes what has happened. Throughout this, SCP-3922-A remains motionless, though it can be observed blinking. The cartoon proceeds as normal until the ending when it cuts back to the SCP-3922-A instance, with the narrator asking “So, you gonna move buddy?” SCP-3922-A instance proceeds to stand up straight, face the camera, bow, and then walks off in the same manner as the old man.

**Interference Point:** Title screen of the //HD ReMIX// collection. The title screen is a group shot of the player characters, several of which are wearing ☽☽☽ iconography, as well as SCP-3922-A instances referred to in-game as Lightning, Beatrix, Cecil, and Kain. It should be noted that these characters all of these instances strongly resemble characters from the Final Fantasy series.
**Result:** Plot deviates heavily from the source material. See below for details.
||~ Game ||~ Synopsis ||
|| Kingdom Hearts Final Mix|| The game begins in media res, with Sora and Riku as members of the ☽☽☽ initiative, working with a squad SCP-3922-A instances to evacuate the Destiny Islands before they are swallowed by darkness. Sora and Riku, now having keyblades, work together to seal the Keyhole, but fail to save Kairi. Tidus, a childhood friend of Sora&#39;s, questions him as to why they left the destiny islands and why they returned. Sora explains via flashback how they were recruited into the ☽☽☽ Initiative to fight the Heartless, due to being destined to weld Keyblades, Sora using the Kingdom Key, and Riku using a ☽☽☽-created weapon referred to in-game as &#34;Warring Triad&#34;. Afterward, Sora meets with his superior, Captain Edgar. It should be noted that while all signs point to Edgar being a character from Final Fantasy 6, with biographical information referring to him as the &#34;Prince of Figaro&#34;, this version of Edgar does not resemble his canonical design, and instead resembles Terra-Xehanort&#39;s Heartless, who was the primary antagonist of Kingdom Hearts 1. Captain Edgar then introduces Sora to Goofy and Donald, is told to help them with their search for King Mickey, and sends Riku and the other ☽☽☽ Initiative members to fight Maleficent&#39;s forces. Individual worlds largely proceed as normal for Sora&#39;s side of the story, with the occasional assistance from one or more of the SCP-3922-A instances due to the villains of each world being associated with Maleficent. Riku has a running subplot that involves being tempted to the dark side by Kain, who is eventually revealed to be mind-controlled by Edgar. Edgar then reveals to Riku that he doesn&#39;t want to destroy the Heartless, but instead seeks to control them so that he can overthrow JALAKÅRA. This, however, turns out to be yet another ruse, as Edgar later reveals that he is actually Terra-Xehanort&#39;s Heartless (though this isn&#39;t revealed until later; as in canon, in this game, he claims to be Ansem the Wise), and takes control of Riku by &#34;opening his heart to the darkness&#34;. Once Sora reaches Hallow Bastion, Xehanort-Riku then destroys Sora&#39;s keyblade using a &#34;Tactical Keyblade Nullification Device&#34;, and Lightning dies in order to give Sora enough time to escape. Sora manages to acquire Riku&#39;s Keyblade, and uses it to stop Xehanort-Riku, though Xehanort-Riku uses the last of his strength to turn Sora into a Heartless, freeing Kairi&#39;s heart in the process (which Xehanort-Riku reveals was trapped inside Sora&#39;s heart the entire time). Sora is then restored to his human form by Kairi, leaving Sora, Goofy, Beatrix, and Cecil to travel to The End of the World and confront Terra-Xehanort&#39;s heartless.||
|| Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories|| The main campaign and Riku&#39;s &#34;reverse rebirth&#34; storyline are largely unchanged, with Sora, Donald, and Goofy exploring worlds of memory inside Castle Oblivion, save that in addition to being made to forget about Kairi, Sora also begins to forget that he was ever a member of the ☽☽☽ Initiative, and the traitorous members of Organization XIII&#39;s motivation changing from wanting Kingdom Hearts for themselves, to wanting to distance themselves from Organization XIII out of fear of the ☽☽☽ Initiative, complete with excessive monologues about how paradoxical it is to feel fear without hearts. Riku&#39;s campaign has more changes, with Beatrix, Cecil, and later Kain joining his party, being represented as &#34;party member cards&#34; that work similarly to how Goofy and Donald worked in Sora&#39;s campaign. Throughout the story, Riku is hounded by Memory-Terra-Xehanort&#39;s Heartless tempting to &#34;embrace his darkness&#34;, the wisdom of which Cecil and Beatrix are at odds over, with Beatrix being confident in Riku&#39;s strength and Cecil concerned that Xehanort will end up controlling Riku again. Ultimately, Riku resolves to &#34;take control of his darkness&#34;, and proves himself to Cecil by purging Xehanort&#39;s influence from Kain, who is also trapped in Castle Oblivion. A post-credits scene shows DiZ (an alias for Ansem the Wise) being confronted by a cloaked figure threatening with a crossbow, revealed in the next game to be the real Edgar. DiZ claims he knows that the ☽☽☽ Initiative has every right to prosecute him for his crimes, but for now they have a common enemy in Organization XIII.||
|| Kingdom Hearts 2||Roxas&#39; prologue has been greatly truncated, taking place over three days rather than seven, and without any intrusions by Axel or Organization XIII. A cutscene with Edgar, DiZ, and Riku reveals that this is because of the ☽☽☽ Initiative&#39;s more advanced technology, which has already debugged Hallow Bastion OS, and recovered the name of Radiant Garden. DiZ is more forthcoming with information to Roxas in this version, explaining that while Nobodies ought to &#34;return to nothing&#34;, Roxas is a special case and that if he agrees to return to Sora&#39;s heart he&#39;ll be given a new body to use once Organization XIII is thwarted. Sora is also warned not to kill Xemnas, Xehanort&#39;s Nobody, because if he did Xehanort would be able to reconstitute himself. From there, Sora wakes up to find that only a month has passed since the last game, and Mickey brings, goofy and Donald up to speed, revealing the identities of Ansem the Wise, Edgar, the nature of Nobodies, and how Xehanort is the mastermind behind the entire thing. Notably, Mickey&#39;s explanation uses information that would not be revealed until Birth by Sleep, namely the fact that Xehanort had been impersonating Ansem the Wise. It is also revealed that Maleficent has already been defeated by Riku, nullifying the threat to Radiant Garden, but he&#39;s been on a secret mission from Edgar ever since, leaving it up to Sora to travel the worlds and fight Organization XIII. Plots of individual worlds are largely the same as before, with a few exceptions: Firstly a new character, Xelicar, has taken Roxas&#39;s place as number XIII in the Organization following his betrayal. This character is later revealed to be Lightning&#39;s Nobody[[footnote]] This follows the canonical naming conventions of Organization XIII, as Lightning&#39;s real name in Final Fantasy XIII is &#34;Claire&#34;. [[/footnote]], as well as a double-agent ultimately working for the ☽☽☽ Initiative. The plot of the Olympus Colosseum level does not occur, due to a treaty made between Hades and JALAKÅRA between the events of 1 and 2. The contents of the treaty are not elaborated upon, save for the fact that the underworld is empty now due to all of its souls being re-routed to Corbenec, and that Hades is uncharacteristically frightened of any mention of JALAKÅRA.  Most of the level is sealed off, but the underworld cup is available from the start and can still be participated in. The World that Never Was is drastically different from the source material, as the ☽☽☽ Initiative lays siege to the dark city. Sora, Riku, Beatrix, Cecil, Kain, Edgar, and Xion (being introduced before //358/2 Days//) almost manage to subdue Xemnas non-lethally, only for Xemnas to be killed by Xigbar, and reveals that he&#39;s part of the &#34;Real Organization XIII&#34;, a plot point that wasn&#39;t introduced until later. Xigbar acts as the final boss, using weaker versions of attacks from the optional &#34;Data Xigbar&#34; fight from Final Mix. A post-credits scene shows Master Xehanort returning to life, and stating that everything is somehow going according to plan despite all of the massive setbacks.||
||Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded|| Segment is approximately five minutes long, and consists of Edgar installing ☽☽☽ Initiative-branded anti-virus software onto the journal-dataification device.||
||Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days||The story is largely similar, but Roxas receives additional resistance throughout the game from the ☽☽☽ Initiative, including boss battles against Beatrix, Cecil, Riku, and Kain. In addition, Axel, Roxas, and Xion frequently change their meeting locations due to attempts by the ☽☽☽ Initiative to assassinate them. A post-credits sequence shows Xion being revived into a replica body, thanks to Riku using a Tactical [REDACTED] Preservation Device to preserve her essence.||
||Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep||[DATA EXPUNGED]||

//For those of you boggling at how complicated this was, let me assure you that the original games were just as confusing. A few things to note about this particular test://
* Despite the games being played out of chronological order, the SCP-3922-2 instances started from the earliest chronological point of the available narrative but does not take Kingdom Hearts χ into account even though it takes place even further back in the narrative. 
* While we&#39;ve seen SCP-3922-2 instances that resemble actors and characters from other media, this test is probably the most blatant example yet. Not only is Sora being recruited into the ☽☽☽ Initiative a plot point, but Cecil and Kain also come from games that have never had major cameos in the Kingdom Hearts series, nor have they been the subjects of SCP-3922 tests. This implies that SCP-3922 isn&#39;t their only source for metafictional agents.
* Unlike many other tests, SCP-3922-2 instances were heavily involved in the revised narrative, as if complex interpersonal relationships and overly-complicated plots were narrative laws that SCP-3922-2 instances were forced to obey.
//In light of these findings, I propose that the Kingdom Hearts series be used as a case study for narrative complexity, to aid in containing future pataphysical and metafictional SCPs. I also propose we also ban Final Fantasy 6 from being used for future tests, just in case the ☽☽☽ Initiative has been using time travel to recruit from future tests.//

**Interference Point:** When the grandfather begins reading the story to his grandson 
**Result:** During the course of the story, when the camera cuts back to the grandfather and grandson, SCP-3922-A enters the room and requests to speak with the grandfather in private. The grandfather agrees, promising to finish the story. Both SCP-3922-A and the grandfather exit the grandson’s room and have a brief conversation. Analysis of the audio has revealed it pertained to SCP-3922-A’s abilities and how they might apprehend  Prince Humperdinck and Count Rugen without interrupting the grandfather’s time with his grandson. The grandfather assures SCP-3922-A that both characters will ‘get what’s coming to them’ by the end. SCP-3922-A accepts this answer and allows the grandfather to resume reading to his grandson. Though no change occurs to the story itself, SCP-3922-A instances can be observed in the background of certain scenes. The end credits conclude with this message: “Though normally we’d waste no time in bringing such despicable characters as Rugen and Humperdinck to justice, we aren’t going to ruin a bonding moment between a grandfather and his sick grandson. - ☽☽☽”

**Interference Point:** When Hans Gruber and his men occupy Nakatomi Plaza.
**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances move to storm the building, attempting to take out Hans via sniper. However, Hans responds to this by contacting law enforcement and informing them that a heavily far-right militia posing as the US military is storming Nakatomi Plaza and relays the position of their snipers. As a result, when SWAT teams arrive they engage in a firefight with the SCP-3922-A instances while attempting to storm the building. What ensues is a brutal engagement between the police and SCP-3922-A. Though both sustain heavy causalities, SCP-3922-A instances are sorely depleted and reduced to a five-man squad. They are informed that they will not be receiving backup so as to avoid an escalation. John McClane is able to join forces with the remaining instances, and together, they are able to successfully convince the LAPD that SCP-3922-A is not their enemy. The two then work together to defeat Hans. At the film’s climax, the SCP-3922-A instances engage several of Hans’s men, buying time for McClane to reach the rooftop and prevent the deaths of the hostages. After John defeats Gruber and the hostages recovered, Karl is killed by fire from both SCP-3922-A and Officer Al Powell.

**Result:** An SCP-3922-A instance, rendered in the game&#39;s art style, appears to lecture Susie on bullying and eating non-edible items. Susie basically ignores this lecture. Kris and Susie still enter the abandoned classroom and still fall into the &#34;Dark World&#34;. Notably, all plot taking place within the Dark World is completely unchanged. After Kris and Susie &#34;emerge&#34; from the Dark World, the epilogue within the town is unchanged, except for the notable absence of Sans.

**Subject:** &#34;Epidemiology&#34;, //Community// episode, 2010, TV-14
**Interference Point:** During Dean Pelton&#39;s call with the army surplus store.
**Result:** The call is immediately transferred to an SCP-3922-A instance, who lectures the dean on the dangers of irresponsibly purchasing food from dubious sources. SCP-3922-A instances arrive shortly after in full-body tactical armor, and turn on the thermostat, killing the virus. The rest of the episode is dedicated to the SCP-3922-A instances disinfecting the Greendale campus and placing the campus under the control of the Three Moons Initiative to ensure the safety of the students. The episode ends with George Takei&#39;s voiceover remarking on the efficiency of the SCP-3922-A instances. The end tag features an SCP-3922-A instance sitting in between Troy and Abed as they perform a rap about the helpfulness of the Three Moons Initiative.

**Subject:** A recording of a playthrough of //Resident Evil 7: Biohazard//, 2017, R
**Interference Point:** Just before the Garage boss fight with Jack Baker.
**Result:** At this part of the game, a deputy would arrive to help Ethan Winters, but Jack Baker would have killed said deputy. Instead, numerous SCP-3922-A instances invade the garage and administer the serum to Jack to cure the Mold bioweapon. He is quickly cured along with the rest of his family as SCP-3922-A instances search through the Baker residence. In the final cutscene, it shows the Molded creatures being destroyed throughout the home, as well as the B.O.W Eveline (designated E-001) being effectively neutralized. Precautions are made so that bioweapons are never used in the United States again. Mia Winters is also found inside along with some others who were captured. The Three Moons Initiative brings Ethan and Mia back to their home safely.

**Subject:** //Cats//, 2019, PG
**Interference Point:** Immediately following Macavity&#39;s song.
**Result:** Macavity is apprehended by three SCP-3922-A instances. One of them starts listing the laws he&#39;s broken as he&#39;s taken to prison. This list continues uninterrupted for 3805 hours and 33 minutes. Macavity can be seen eating, sleeping, and using the provided litter box during this time. After the instance stops, Macavity says, &#34;I wasn&#39;t there for any of those.&#34; The instance shoots him. The rest of the cast is not seen after the interference point.

**Subject:** //The Cruelty of God//[[footnote]]A short film produced by the Department of Pataphysics for the purpose of testing whether [[[sandrewswann-s-proposal |SWN001]]] entities are held accountable by SCP-3922-A for any adverse events and phenomena they cause in baseline reality. The film consists of Dr. Placeholder McDoctorate depicting a SWN001 entity (&#34;Horror McWriterson&#34;) writing and explaining a narrative in which all Foundation personnel stationed at Site-19 are brutally tortured and killed in a mass containment breach. [[/footnote]], 2020, Unrated
**Interference Point:** Shortly after Horror McWriterson explains the narrative to the audience and starts to write
**Result:** Five minutes into the film, a single SCP-3922-A entity emerges from the doorway behind McWriterson and quietly looks over his shoulder until he becomes aware of its presence. The SCP-3922-A entity then sits down in a chair next to McWriterson and lectures him on the specific steps that should be taken when writing a short story, recommending that he focus on attempting to evoke specific emotions in the reader and avoid overly graphic depictions of wanton destruction and violence for shock value. McWriterson appears to take this advice to heart and alters the narrative to follow a single unnamed Foundation employee struggling to move on after the loss of a loved one in a containment breach. The film fades to black as McWriterson begins to draft the story, and the screen displays a message suggesting that the SCP-3922-A entity aided him in proofreading and helped him publish the story to an online forum.

**Subject:** Season 1 of //Columbo//, 1971-72, Not Rated
**Interference Point:** Entire narrative.
**Result:** Plot remains largely unaffected. Detective Columbo and all other members of the Los Angeles Police Department are instances of SCP-3922-A, though Columbo still wears his typical raincoat while doing detective work. The only major narrative change is the execution of each suspect directly following their incrimination, typically with laser weaponry. Notably, the show&#39;s opening theme is arranged similarly to [[[SCP-5319]]].
**Note:** //It appears SCP-3922 interference with police-related plots extends further if said plots involve police-related, rather than suspect-related conflicts (see above test).// -- Junior Researcher Falk

**Subject:** A recording of a playthrough of the online social deduction game //Among Us// (2018), done in a private researcher-run server. The playthrough in question ended with an Imposter victory. Unrated. 
**Interference Point:** Beginning of the playthrough. 
**Result:** An additional player with the handle THREEMOONS spawns in at the start of the playthrough, with a black spacesuit and a gas mask cosmetic consistent with masks worn by instances of SCP-3922-A. The game proceeds as normal until the first body is reported, with the SCP-3922-A instance appearing to follow the imposter just out of sight before catching them in the act of killing and immediately reporting the body. In the resulting meeting, the SCP-3922-A instance attempts to argue in favor of ejecting the correct imposter, writing that they caught them in the act, but is ejected after the Imposter replies &#34;black kinda sus ngl&#34;. The Imposter is struck with what appear to be several dozen Impaler events from all directions following the end of the meeting, after which the recording ends.

**Subject:** Playthrough of //Half-Life: Alyx// (2020), Not Rated
**Interference Point:** At the point the player finds Alyx Vance&#39;s father, Eli Vance, being detained by the Combine.
**Result:** Shortly after the elevator door opens, the Combine soldiers are shown being detained or killed by the SCP-3922-A instances. The player and Eli hide within the elevator as the instances fight Combine soldiers responding to the disturbance. Eventually, the player leaves the elevator and goes outside, only to find that massive aircraft have arrived all over the city, and are either deploying SCP-3922-A instances or abducting Combine technology. Footage of the conflict continues for around 10 minutes before the player is rendered unconscious by falling debris. They are awoken an unknown amount of time later inside of an empty building on a mattress, and upon entering the outside world, the Combine, along with the SCP-3922-A instances, seem to have completely vacated the city. The remainder of the gameplay recording (4 hours) shows the player doing mundane tasks that would be expected of a virtual reality game, with very little combat.
Snippets from dialogue with NPCs and other contextual clues seem to indicate that SCP-3922-A instances successfully removed the Combine, along with most of the Xen wildlife brought to Earth. Despite this, they were unable to help with the disastrous climate left behind by the previous invaders and therefore left humanity to decide its own fate from there.
In a newspaper picked up by the player at one point, it is shown that Dr. Wallace Breen, the administrator for Earth under the Combine, who negotiated humanity&#39;s surrender, was charged with various crimes. Scientists who previously worked at Black Mesa (including Gordon Freeman, the protagonist in various other Half-Life titles) were also charged due to their involvement in causing the Resonance Cascade.

**Subject:**  &#34;Unedited Footage of a Bear&#34;, 2014, TV-14
**Interference Point:**  Approximately 30 seconds after the beginning, when the titular footage would normally be &#34;interrupted&#34; by a surreal advertisement for fictional allergy medication Claridryl.
**Result:**  A brief message reading &#34;ADVERTISEMENTS BLOCKED BY ☽☽☽ TACTICAL AD-BLOCKER&#34; appears in the bottom left corner of the screen.  The unedited bear footage (a male grizzly bear sitting in the forest, with quiet narration by an unseen videographer) continues uninterrupted for the entire duration of the short.

**Subject:**  //Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off//, 1986, PG-13
**Interference Point:**  When the titular character claims to his mother that he is ill, in order to skip school.
**Result:**  An SCP-3922-A instance enters Bueller&#39;s bedroom and reveals to his mother the various means by which Bueller has faked illness.  Bueller&#39;s mother expresses disappointment and forces him to get out of bed.  She then thanks the SCP-3922-A instance and promises to make sure that Bueller does not skip school again.  The movie continues for the full duration, chronicling Bueller&#39;s normal day at school.  During the end credits, an SCP-3922-A instance wearing a striped bathrobe over its armor emerges from the Bueller house&#39;s bathroom and approaches the camera until its face fills the screen.  It then says &#34;You are watched.  You are protected.  You are loved.&#34; and returns to the bathroom.  The film then ends.

**Subject:** //Fate/stay night: Heaven&#39;s Feel I. presage flower//, 2017, TV-MA
**Interference Point:** Fifty seconds into the film. 
**Result:** The film opens as original, with all relevant company logos, and the initial flashback sequence with Shirou Emiya practicing archery initially appears unchanged. However, when Shinji Matou appears at about fifty seconds into the movie, he is immediately shoulder-tackled by an SCP-3922-A instance, followed by several more holding steel folding chairs, who proceed to beat him to the point of apparent death with the chairs while yelling various expletives directed at his incestuous and rapacious behavior. Shirou is visibly confused and frightened by this and attempts to assist Shinji, but the initial SCP-3922-A instance blocks him and begins shaking its head slowly, telling him to &#34;just let this happen.&#34; The film then skips to what would ordinarily be around the four-minute mark, with Sakura Matou arriving at the Emiya house, except in the changed film she is accompanied by yet another SCP-3922-A instance. Shirou reacts with confusion as in the original film, but the instance cuts him off, stating that Sakura&#39;s grandfather (presumably Zouken Matou as in the original) has been executed for child abuse and human experimentation and that when asked where she would be able to stay, Sakura chose the Emiya house. Shirou briefly looks dumbfounded, then nods and takes her inside. The film fully diverges from the original at this point, cutting to a shot of the Matou basement being invaded by SCP-3922-A instances holding flamethrowers, followed by a shot of the Matou house burning in its entirety. The film then proceeds as a relatively light romantic drama for the remainder of its original runtime, with Shirou and Sakura slowly entering a relationship, interspersed with the latter getting occasional psychotherapy sessions from yet another SCP-3922-A instance wearing a lab coat and a stethoscope. The &#34;Holy Grail War&#34; battle royale featured in the original as its central premise appears to be entirely missing, as is the character of Rin Tohsaka, aside from a few passing mentions from Shirou&#39;s classmates in school scenes.
**Note:** //I&#39;m not entirely sure whether this would fall under the &#34;don&#39;t give the SCP gods or superweapons&#34; blanket denial, but Director Naismith appears to be on sabbatical, so... better to beg forgiveness than wait for permission. The SCP seems to have ignored several plot twists that come up in the second and third films, which gives me the impression that, when given part of a series, it only maintains awareness of that specific part rather than the series as a whole; this merits further testing. Also, god **damn**, it was satisfying to see Shinji get his shit beaten in with steel chairs.// -- Junior Researcher Tucker

**Subject:** //Godzilla//, October 7 1954, TV-MA
**Interference Point:** After Godzilla&#39;s first appearance on Odo Island
**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances evacuate the island and pursue Godzilla using helicopters, firing on him with missiles as he retreats to the sea. SCP-3922-A instances aid in the efforts to destroy Godzilla alongside the Japanese government, ignoring the advice of Kyohei Yamane. After a thorough bombardment of Godzilla&#39;s last known location using depth charges, Godzilla is declared destroyed. Come nightfall, Godzilla emerges from the ocean and attacks Tokyo, to the shock and horror of SCP-3922-A forces. In the ensuing battle, SCP-3922-A uses several weapons to try and destroy Godzilla, all to seemingly no avail. At one point, a large mecha is deployed, but it too is destroyed. When the option of nuclear weapons is brought up, it is shot down on the basis of Godzilla having already survived such a weapon. By the end of Godzilla&#39;s rampage, SCP-3922-A has taken heavy casualties, many of which suffer radiation burns and poisoning. When Dr. Serizawa offers the use of the Oxygen Destroyer, the SCP-3922-A instances requests a demonstration after which they fully support Serizawa&#39;s wishes to destroy his notes and ensure it is only used once, making it clear they do not want any copies of this weapon. The film ends much the same way as in the original, with SCP-3922-A instances watching Godzilla&#39;s death solemnly. The only other notable end is the following message in Hiragana; &#34;Nature has no master. One of its creatures reminded us of that. - ☽☽☽&#34;

**Subject:** //Catch Me If You Can//, 2002 , PG-13
**Interference Point:** Shortly before the scene where Frank Abagnale gets shoved into a locker by an unnamed bully. 
**Result:** An SCP-3922-A instance can be seen in the background armed with a submachine gun, which the bully and friend pass and are visibly intimidated with a drastic change in their demeanor, quietly passing by Frank on their way to their next class. Frank Abagnale does not appear to notice the instance and instead continues to his French class, where another SCP-3922-A instance is standing at the front of the classroom, armed with a blaster rifle slung over a shoulder. The instance gives a brief stern lecture to all the students on giving their authority figures the proper respect they deserve until the substitute teacher arrives. A short brief exchange ensues between the two, coming to a mutual agreement that the instance would stay in the class to keep order for the rest of the school year. Frank Abagnale is inspired by the incident and later in the film, with the help of a “Initiative Marriage Counselor”, reconciles both of his parents and pursues a new dream of being a criminal investigator, discovering a talent of discerning check fraud. The film ends with Frank Abagnale shaking hands with his new superior Carl Hanratty while Hanratty’s colleagues and SCP-3922-A instances look on. The camera zooms out a nearby window, revealing the exterior of the FBI J. Edgar Hoover building with a large Three Moons Initiative sign, before fading to black with the credits.

**Subject:** //Recorded Playthrough of Deltarune: Chapter 2//, 2021, T
**Interference Point:** Arrival of Kris and Toriel at the school by car.
**Result:** Upon arriving at the school, Kris and Toriel discover that SCP-3922-A instances have taken over the building, citing the detection of an &#34;extradimensional gateway of unknown origin.&#34; As a result, the school is cordoned off, and residents of the town are protesting outside. SCP-3922-A instances are seen confiscating items from the abandoned classroom. Alphys, who is waiting nearby with the protesters, explains that she has sent the rest of the class home to complete their project as homework. Kris suggests to Susie that they head to the Library and enter the new Dark World through the computer room. Upon encountering Ralsei, they learn that the entrance to the closet has been barred, and the well-being of the Darkners is unknown. Susie insists on speeding up their quest to seize the new Dark Fountain. After this point, the game sees minimal changes, including the absence of encounters with Lancer[[footnote]] In the game&#39;s section where Kris and Susie are imprisoned by Queen, where originally the key item needed to escape was Lancer, Susie instead asks Queen if she could go to the bathroom, after which Queen complies without any suspicion or doubt and releases her, resulting in Susie freeing Kris herself in the same way as Lancer. [[/footnote]] or Rouxls, and the Spamton fight ending abruptly due to a &#34;☽☽☽ TACTICAL AD-BLOCKER.&#34; Sans&#39;s grocery store is also closed. Playing through the &#34;Weird Route&#34; does not result in any major changes, aside from the absence of the final boss.
Note: It appears that the SCP-3922-A instances are treating the Darkners in a similar manner to how the Legos were treated in The LEGO Movie test, incarcerating objects that are only sapient in a specific dimension/plane of existence. However, it remains unclear why SCP-3922-A did not notice the portal in the first chapter. It is possible that the Dark Fountain was created recently, but SCP-3922-A is known to be faster than normal police forces, making this theory uncertain. - Director Naismith

**Subject:** What&#39;s Up: Balloon to the Rescue!, 2009, Unrated
**Interference Point:** During the dinner scene at the end of the movie, before Amanda introduces Ching Ling, her new boyfriend.
**Result:** An airship appears behind the windows, followed by SCP-3922-A instances bursting through them. They order the entire family to put their hands up, followed by them being handcuffed. They are promptly told that they have been mishandling interdimensional technology, using it to imprison another person with three monsters. They then search for the rock that was used to do it, eventually finding it and releasing Jean-Pierre from the dimension, before arresting him for also mishandling the same technology, via recklessly releasing the same three monsters and hypnotizing the family. He is also charged with trapping them in a cave in the Amazon, as well as drugging Guto, Dr. Crumb, and Dr. Zoox. After all, 5 of them are taken away, Ching Ling walks into the dining room, now occupied by SCP-3922-A instances. He is told that while he did help with capturing the monsters, he shouldn&#39;t be involving himself with it and that he should leave it to the proper authorities. As he wasn&#39;t involved with any of the crimes the family and Jean-Pierre were charged for, Ching Ling is instead offered a position to work with the Three Moons Initiative if he shows a genuine interest in catching monsters. At this point, the experiment was halted, due to the possibility of Ching Ling entering the real world.
**Note:** //Let this be a warning not to do these kinds of tests without watching the whole movie. The scientist that ordered this had only watched a [[[https://youtu.be/j9S3I-_S3QQ | review]]] of the movie before proceeding, and they have been reprimanded accordingly. -Researcher Masterson//

**Interference Point:** The opening cutscene, just before the initial murder.
**Result:** A dropship lands on the main deck of the ship, and several instances of SCP-3922-A come out, and proceed to detain Mrs. Villensey suspected of conspiracy to murder her husband.[[footnote]]It is never directly stated whether she had planned to murder her husband prior to doing so.[[/footnote]] They also detained several other characters, including Lady Armstrong for several counts of blackmail, Lieutenant Ander for impersonation of a military officer, and the initial murder victim of the game, Mr. Villensey, for several outstanding debts in his name as well as having shown fascist sympathies. Mrs. Villensey is confined to her cabin for the entire playthrough, an instance of -A guarding the door. The game ends with a -A instance interrogating Mrs. Villensey in a New York Police Station, the latter denying all charges, before a newspaper end results screen with the headline &#34;CRIMES HALTED ON THE HIGH SEAS!&#34;, covering the prior events appears on screen, with the end result checklist changed to &#34;WATCHED, PROTECTED, LOVED.&#34;

**Subject:** //Babylon 5//, Season 4 Episode 6, &#34;Into the Fire &#34; (1997), PG
**Interference Point:** When the cast call in the First One ships.
**Result:** An additional ship appears bearing the usual three crescent moon decals. The cast are surprised at its presense, as they &#34;didn&#39;t ask //them// for help&#34;. The new ship sends a transmission appologising that &#34;this was all we could spare&#34;. Remainder of the episode proceeds largely as per script. However, when the character Lorien prepares to leave, he takes a moment to glance at the new ship, and appears to call to them and warn that &#34;Nothing lasts forever - not even me, and not even you.&#34; Any response from the ship is not shown.
//One interpretation of this is that while SCP-3922-A&#39;s supply of manpower doesn&#39;t seem to have a limit, their supply of capital spaceships appears to be quite finite. - Research Assistant Charlotte//

**Interference Point:** Beginning of game.
**Result:** Game begins as normal. When Rex walks into Chairman Bana&#39;s office, the Nopon is cleaved in half by a gunblade-wielding SCP-3922-A instance serving as a Driver[[footnote]]A person or being who bonds with a &#34;Blade&#34; creature and can wield their weapon.[[/footnote]] to a Common Blade.[[footnote]]A lifeform born from a Core Crystal that can generate a weapon as an extension of itself for its Driver to wield.[[/footnote]] We then see that multiple Drivers bearing the ☽☽☽ insignia are in Bana&#39;s office, and they recruit Rex into their ranks. During Chapter 1, Rex, Nia and Jin (now bearing ☽☽☽ uniforms of their own) travel to the now-intact but abandoned Kingdom of Torna, where Mythra (the Aegis) is resting instead of Pyra. Jin is corrupted by JALAKÅRA at the start of the game, and now backstabs Rex for a chance to claim the Aegis for his own. As Mythra awakens and bonds with Rex, a dormant Malos also awakens (with mention of JALAKÅRA) and bonds with Jin. Plot then follows the same general beats as the original game, but with Mythra replacing Pyra in all instances,[[footnote]]Pyra&#39;s absence from the game implies that the events of the prequel game //Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna ~ The Golden Country// (2018) were also affected, in which she manifested as a result of Mythra&#39;s trauma.[[/footnote]] Vandham surviving as a permanent party member, Praetor Rhadallis replacing Praetor Amalthus in a non-villainous role, and the Poppibuster sidequest being changed to arrest Grampypon Soosoo on charges of sexually explicit material of minors.

Give up hope now!&#34; The player attempts to attack, but the SCP-3922-A instances avoid it. They then fire an unavoidable rain of bullets at the player&#39;s SOUL, killing them quickly. After the battle, Toriel appears and expresses concern, but one SCP-3922-A instance explains to her that they just saved her from taking in a murderer, and she thanks them.

**Interference Point:** 20 minutes, 45 seconds into the video.
**Result:** The narrator begins discussing an event known as the &#34;Eighth Incursion&#34;, wherein hundreds of players resembling pixelated versions of SCP-3922-A instances flooded onto the server and engaged in player-versus-player combat with other server members. The narrator explains that because the SCP-3922-A instances were not using hacked clients, the other players were able to easily beat them back. The video proceeds as normal after this point, although at the end, a screen is shown displaying the ☽☽☽ logo with the word &#34;UNSALVAGEABLE&#34; written below it.
**Notes:** //Admittedly, I am too old to know what any of this means, but I do find this result interesting. The fact that SCP-3922-A instances refused to use &#39;Hacked clients&#39; might imply that they are operating in the universe of the game directly, as opposed to operating in the universe of those playing on the server. -Senior Researcher Talapus//

A &#34;Tactical Financial Regulation Unit&#34; occupies the island and announces an audit will take place to confirm Cryptoland&#39;s compliance with the financial laws of Fiji.[[footnote]]The original Cryptoland proposal involved purchasing an island within Fiji territory for $12 million, though this plan subsequently fell through when the bid for the island did not succeed.[[/footnote]] Shortly afterwards, the island&#39;s casino is shut down (gambling is illegal in Fiji) and the anthropomorphic &#34;Connie&#34; NFT coin is arrested by SCP-3922-A instances after an audit reveals a planned rug pull[[footnote]]Slang term in the cryptocurrency world for fraudulent projects designed to steal the money of investors.[[/footnote]] of the island&#39;s preferred Cryptolanders currency. The SCP-3922-A instances compel all residents of Cryptoland to take a &#34;Financial Literacy Course&#34; which warns of the dangers of unregulated financial markets. The video ends as the local authorities in Fiji are contacted by SCP-3922-A and announce a national investigation into Cryptoland in response to SCP-3922-A&#39;s findings.

**Result:** The character &#39;Shroomy&#39; alerts the other characters that he has requested backup from the &#34;Three Moons People&#34; to help get Mario out of the door. Several poorly rendered soldiers enter into Mario&#39;s house through the back door and windows. The soldiers explain that they are going to implement &#34;Protocol November Golf Sierra,&#34; while wildly flailing most of their limbs.[[footnote]] this kind of movement is common in videos uploaded by the SMG4 youtube channel.[[/footnote]] After telling everyone to back away from Mario and the door, a handheld power saw appears in the hands of one of the soldiers. This soldier proceeds to make a semicircular cut in the door to remove the locking mechanism, but is unsuccessful. At this point, the house is attacked by alien spaceships, killing several SCP-3922-A instances and throwing the rest of the unit into disarray. One instance, presumably the commander, yells into a radio that &#34;these [expletive] aliens just showed up, I don&#39;t know what the hell is going on.&#34; After about 2 minutes 30 seconds, reinforcements arrive on site to combat the threat. SCP-3922-A forces initially appear to be winning the engagement, but at approximately 7 minutes, 20 seconds into the video, the aliens begin launching freestanding doors at the soldiers via ship-mounted cannons. These doors attach themselves onto the groin areas of hundreds SCP-3922-A instances, who display great amounts of distress. The commander then screams into his radio &#34;What the [expletive] is this video they don&#39;t pay me enough for this [expletive],&#34; before giving the order to fall back. The rest of the video proceeds as normal, with an end card displaying the phrase: &#34;KEIN SCHLACHTPLAN ÜBERLEBT DEN KONTAKT MIT DEM FEIND&#34;[[footnote]] &#34;No battle plan survives contact with the enemy,&#34; a quote attributed to German military strategist Helmuth von Moltke. [[/footnote]] 
**Notes:** //It would seem that SCP-3922 did not have beforehand knowledge of the outcome of the video. This, along with the end card message, implies that SCP-3922-A does not manifest with prior knowledge of the media, instead making tactical decisions in real-time. -Senior Researcher Talapus//

**Subject:** //Hololive Funkin&#39;// version 5.0.0, 2021, unrated (full playthrough recorded)
**Interference Point:** Week 2, before the song &#34;Mythbuster&#34;
**Result:** Amelia Watson&#39;s dialogue is interrupted by a phone call from a &#34;Chief Subaru,&#34;[[footnote]] Subaru Oozora is mentioned in supplementary material as the implied chief of an unseen police force Amelia works for. Neither appear or are mentioned in unaltered gameplay. [[/footnote]] who asks her to set her watch&#39;s &#34;destination&#34; to October 2001 under orders from &#34;those Three Moon guys again,&#34; adding that an armed escort is waiting outside the mansion to come with her. Though Amelia is initially hesitant to comply, Subaru convinces her to go through with the operation. Amelia then exits the scene despite obvious confusion from protagonists Aloe Mano and Nene Momosuzu, which is followed by a fade to white. The game crashes and restarts with all story progression wiped; upon proceeding to the tutorial, the game&#39;s dialogue is revealed to have been radically altered even further.

In this altered narrative, Kouta Kurayami is absent from the story, having been arrested 19 years ago for various crimes related to gang violence. This additionally causes a butterfly effect where background characters Hana and Kaede Kurayami do not exist, Aloe&#39;s adoptive father Mamoru Mano remains alive, and Aloe remains a thriving talent under Hololive Production; this is reflected in her dialogue through increased confidence and improved emotional health compared to unaltered events. Specific changes are documented below, sorted by week.

||~ Week # ||~ Original events ||~ Change ||
|| Tutorial || Nene prepares to help restart Aloe&#39;s music career. || Dialogue is rewritten to instead be about Aloe diversifying her current musical record into rap. ||
|| 1 || Calliope Mori finds Aloe in the building where she is practicing with Nene Momosuzu, and offers a rap battle to help her out. || Dialogue is altered to suggest practice sessions similar to Week 1 occur regularly. The visuals for Nene&#39;s &#34;impromptu stream&#34; no longer obscure Aloe. SCP-3922-A does not appear or directly influence events/dialogue during this week. ||
|| 2 || Aloe and Nene take shelter from a storm in a mansion revealed to belong to Mr. Kurayami. They meet Amelia Watson and Gura Gawr, who offer to sing to pass the time. Haachama, the mansion&#39;s cook, interrupts in an attempt to kill and eat all four, but they manage to escape after Mr. Kurayami tells off Haachama. || The mansion is implied to belong to a different occupant in Mr. Kurayami&#39;s absence, though the overall plot remains unchanged until the cutscene for the song &#34;Haachama.&#34; As the character of the same name appears, SCP-3922-A instances appear to restrain and institutionalize her over her violent dissociative identity disorder episodes, wearing protective equipment to resist her cognitohazardous abilities. The end card that appears in this week is replaced by the standard SCP-3922 ending message, drawn in the style of the //Holo no Graffiti// web series similar to the appearance of the original. ||
|| 3|| Aloe and Nene are approached by their friend Botan Shishiro, having been misled using her mercenary background into an assassination attempt on them by Mr. Kurayami. Upon learning the truth, Aloe and Botan settle to sing with each other instead, with Aloe revealing her past midway through the week. || Entire scene is rewritten into a routine meetup between the three characters. Botan makes no mention of her criminal past but retains her training in firearms. Careful analysis reveals a Three Moons insignia etched into her AK-47 where the drawing of the &#34;SSRB&#34; mascot normally appears. Aloe&#39;s exposition about her backstory is replaced with Botan discussing a brief career period within the Three Moons Initiative implied to have ended years before the events of the game; due to the urban fantasy setting, neither Aloe nor Nene is seemingly fazed by this. Botan&#39;s &#34;WANTED&#34; poster is absent from the background, and Pico&#39;s &#34;WANTED&#34; poster is replaced with one sponsored by the TMI crudely depicting a fox spirit. _
 _
The ending dialogue for the week is replaced with Botan noticing said poster and tearing it off the pole it is attached to. Aloe attempts to question her on the matter, but she simply replies that &#34;some people don&#39;t deserve to be associated with the memories of their actions.&#34; The week ends without further elaboration.||
|| 4 || Aloe goes to Coco Kiryu&#39;s yakuza clan alone in an attempt to keep Botan out of harm. Coco obliges after a song battle and sudden moral support from Aloe&#39;s friends, but accidentally reveals the news of her impending retirement. || Rather than going to Coco for help, Aloe is invited by her to participate in a &#34;rap review.&#34; Coco makes an offhand mention of an agency implied to be a group of SCP-3922-A shutting down the Kiryu Clan&#39;s drug trade but adds that they had received a grant to bolster their legitimate operations from an unknown benefactor. ||
|| 5 || Nene takes Aloe shopping for clothes in a mall, which is hosting a Christmas promotion with Ina&#39;nis &#34;Ina&#34; Ninomae dressed as a mall Santa. Calliope appears with Kiara Takanashi and holds Ina at gunpoint, with Aloe successfully coaxing her into another song battle to stall for time. After Kiara and Aloe successfully dissuade Calliope, Haachama appears again and invokes her cognitohazardous abilities in another attempt to kill Aloe and Nene, though they escape unharmed.|| Calliope no longer attempts to hold Ina at gunpoint; though the dialogue does not explain this change, SCP-3922-A instances can be seen staring in the background where Hana, Kaede, and Haachama normally stand in the unaltered course of events. Noticeably, background character Kenji Tensei is also absent from the background but is not filled in by SCP-3922-A. The song &#34;Red and Black&#34; is removed from the narrative due to the absence of Haachama. ||
|| &#34;Killer Scream&#34; (freeplay) || Nene takes Aloe to a secluded grotto to practice singing. Its groundskeeper, Rushia Uruha, threatens to transform them into undead for trespassing, but is convinced to stand down on the condition that she be beaten in a song battle. || A fence with a Three Moons insignia surrounds the grotto, preventing Aloe and Nene from entering; they elect to leave after recognizing the symbol. ||
Repeating the test with the alternate story route //The Adventures of Detective Fubuki// yields negligible changes from the original dialogue aside from the continued absence of Haachama, Kenji, and the Kurayami family. However, both Fubuki Shirakami and Mio Ookami have TMI iconography added to their clothing, which is semi-frequently commented on by the rest of the cast.
**Notes:** //That&#39;s... one way to treat her better than the old story, I guess? I can see why the actual replacement story cuts out the middlemen entirely, though.// - Researcher Vesia
//At the request of Pataphysics, I cross-referenced the wanted poster with internet archives related to the game.

**Result:** As Ador follows the criminal, several SCP-3922-A instances descend from helicopters and take over, revealing themselves as members of The Three Moons Initiative. The SCP-3922-A instances successfully capture the criminal for extortion, and SPO1 Ramos for manipulating the criminal to commit the crime. After this, Ador is held in interrogation for a while by the SCP-3922-A instances, who explain that they have taken over the war on drugs and other illegal activities nationwide and that Cardo can retire to be happy with his family. Ador is later set free from the interrogation but continues his work as a police chief. The next scene shows a long montage where the SCP-3922-A instances successfully capture various criminals. In one scene, they successfully capture Don Emilio and his associates, using a combination of laser weaponry and stun grenades. The remaining scenes of the episode show Ador adjusting to life with his wife and son, and occasionally being checked on by SCP-3922-A instances. The episode ends with Ador and his wife guiding their son to school, as the camera pans out showing multiple SCP-3922-A instances protecting the school and other buildings nearby which are all painted with The Three Moons insignia.

The next scene shows SCP-3922-A being tasked with cleaning up the aftermath of the main character&#39;s rampage. The recording then fades out, showing the normal Three Moons ending title card.

**Result:** The camera then flips to the back to show SCP-3922-A instances barging through the door. SCP-3922-A instances immediately shoot the man holding the gun, this continues after the death of the man. The SCP-3922-A instances then proceed to untie the woman and escort her out of the room.

**Subject:** [[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vffu6FG4YP4 | LACKADAISY (Pilot)]]], 2023, Unrated
**Interference Point:**  5:51 into the video, When the Lackadaisy trio[[footnote]] Consisting of Ivy Pepper, Calvin &#34;Freckle&#34; Mcurray, and Roark &#34;Rocky&#34; Rickaby.[[/footnote]] are Ambushed by the Marigold Gang.
**Result:** As Ivy turns around, an SCP-3922-A instance steps out of the vehicle, carrying a Browning Automatic Fire, before opening fire. The video continues as normal (aside from the lack of the Marigold Gang) until 15:52 in the video, when one of the SCP-3922-A instances says, supposedly to a superior, “We lost them, we’ll try again later.” The episode continues as normal, except for the post credit scene, which is removed entirely.
**Note:** //Usually, SCP-3922-A would’ve taken care of them by the first chance, but it’s almost like they were purposefully going easy on the Lackadaisy Crew. But that begs the question, what makes Lackadaisy so different from any other sort of media they’ve encountered before? Surely, given the legality of prohibition at the time, they would have gone much harder on them, right? Perhaps more indie media needs to be tested in the near future.// - Dr. Nasimith

**Interference Point**: N/A
**Result:** N/A
**Note:** //Denied with extreme prejudice. I know I requested more indie media, but the pilot takes place in the same universe as Helluva Boss which not only features powerful demons and demigods but the actual creator of heaven and earth, **GOD**. Moreover, we can&#39;t risk the ☽☽☽&#39;s commandeering access to Stolas&#39; Grimoire and gaining the power to directly enter our baseline reality from the afterlife. On top of that, several movies and shows exist and get referenced all the time. No indie cartoons that involve the afterlife like Obituary or Welcome to Hell.//- Dr. Naismith

**Subject:** Robots, 2005, PG
**Interference Point**: When Bigweld knocks over the dominoes on The Bigweld Show.
**Result:** As the dominoes knock over, they land on the pause button of a remote control that resembles [[[SCP-5510]]]. Bigweld and the various object and characters in the background freeze in place. 15 seconds later, Bigweld&#39;s body opens up to reveal a CGI render resembling a
simulacrum of Mel Brooks circa 2005 wearing a blue motion capture suit. The following exchange ensues.
&gt; **Brooks:** Alright, come on out! I know you guys are hiding here.
&gt; //Several automatons resembling anthropomorphic instances of SCP-2578 wearing SCP-3922-A attire materialize around Melbrooks.//
&gt; **Brooks:** I knew it! I thought I was clear about this: You guys are not supposed to interfere with my movies.
&gt; //Brooks points directly to the screen.//
&gt; **Brooks:** And you guys are not supposed to run experiments on my movies.
&gt; //One of the automatons opens up to reveal a CGI render of SCP-3922-A, wearing a white motion capture suit.//
&gt; **SCP-3922-A:** Mr. Brooks, with all due respect, this is not your movie. You didn&#39;t direct or pro...
&gt; **Brooks:** You think I don&#39;t know that! That&#39;s why I got this!
&gt; //Brooks produces a clipboard containing several sheets of paper from the Bigweld exoskeleton and hands it to the SCP-3911-A instance. They proceed to thumb through the sheets for 5 minutes.//
&gt;
&gt; **SCP-3922-A:** Yeah, okay, fantastic.
&gt;
&gt; //Instance directly faces the camera//
&gt;
&gt; **SCP-3922-A:** So um, just so you guys at home know, this is an amendment to the //	Melvin James Kaminsky Exclusion Act of 1945// ratified in 2015. The TL;DR is that it extends the legal definition of a Mel Brooks movie to anything that he was even remotely involved in the creation of. This includes movies that Mel Brooks produced, wrote for, directed, or starred in. It also extends this exemption to any movie that starred an actor whose career was heavily dependent on Brooks like Gene Wilder.
&gt;
&gt; //The SCP-3922-A holds up the document to the screen which contains the signatures of all current, past, and future members the O-5 Council, The Ethics Committee, the Administrator, and Dr. Naismith[[footnote]] Analysis confirms all signatures to be genuine. [[/footnote]]. He proceeds to hand it back to Brooks.//
&gt;
&gt; **Brooks:** Thank you! Now get out of here.
&gt;
&gt; //SCP-3922-A instances climb back inside their exoskeletons and promptly de-manifest. Mel Brooks places a domino into Bigweld&#39;s right hand. He climbs back into Bigweld with the SCP-5510 replica. He pauses to look back at the screen.//
&gt;
&gt; **Brooks:** Honestly, I think you guys have bigger fish to fry than shoehorning the space men into your favorite movies. Don&#39;t cha think?
&gt;
&gt; //Bigweld closes. The film resumes with no further alterations.//
&gt;
**Note:** //... No seriously, how? I don&#39;t even remember signing that thing.//- Dr. Naismith

**Subject:** //Who Killed Captain Alex?//, 1 March 2010
**Interference Point:** End of film
**Result:** In an end credits scene, a single SCP-3922-A instance is sitting in a chair. They turn to the camera and say, &#34;What was that?&#34;
**Note:** //Sounds about right.// - Researcher Lang

**Subject:** //Watership Down//, 19 October 1978, PG
**Interference Point:** Beginning of opening credits
**Result:** The following message is posted;
&gt; The ☽☽☽ Initiative gives this film an NC-15 rating; NOT FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FIFTEEN.
**Note:** //They didn&#39;t even hesitate. But age rating change aside, I just realized that technically, nothing illegal really happens in this film. That makes me curious about what other tests might yield.// - Researcher Lang

**Subject:** //Chainsaw Man//, Episode 1 &#34;Dog &amp; Chainsaw&#34;, 2022, TV-MA
**Interference Point:** The Zombie Devil reveals itself and sends its zombies to kill Denji and Pochita.
**Result:** Multiple SCP-3922-A instances storm the warehouse and gun down the zombies and the Zombie Devil itself. One of the instances then approaches Denji and offers him food and shelter. However, the instance then suddenly undergoes a drastic change in personality, exclaiming to Denji that &#34;the boss&#34; is here. As in the unaltered episode, Makima arrives in a car with her assistants, except the three of them are wearing tactical suits emblazoned with ☽☽☽ symbols. All instances of SCP-3922-A immediately begin praising Makima. Makima approaches Denji, and politely asks him for  Pochita so they can take care of him together. Denji, infatuated with her, obliges as Pochita begins to growl and snarl at Makima. Makima faces the camera and [DATA EXPUNGED], necessitating that all researchers present be administered Class A amnestics.
**Note:** //Proposal to require extensive research of the source material before further testing of SCP-3922. Researcher Kwon hadn&#39;t read the manga and was unaware of Makima&#39;s true nature and power level, and because of her ignorance we nearly got a new dangerous anomaly running loose.// - Dr. Hawthorne

**Subject:** //Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan//, 2006, R
**Interference Point:** The scene where Borat Sagdiyev is chasing an American civilian with the stated aim of &#34;saying hi&#34;.
**Result:** Several SCP-3922-A instances interfere to restrain Borat and place him in a black truck which carries the ☽☽☽ symbol on it. They then take him into a rehabilitation clinic where numerous other Third World country citizens are schooled in classes taught by SCP-3922-A instances. The rest of the movie consists of SCP-3922-A&#39;s semi-successful attempts to teach Borat about Western culture and human decency, however, Borat&#39;s ignorancy and obliviousness make this process extremely difficult. The movie lasts for close to 2 hours 45 minutes, and in the end, Borat is deemed &#34;safe for the public&#34; and is reintegrated into American society.

**Subject:** //Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan//, 2020, R
**Interference Point:** The scene where Borat is being tortured by the residents of his village.
**Result:** Several SCP-3922-A instances intervene with the scene to detain the village residents overseeing Borat&#39;s persecution. They free Borat from his torment with whom they appear to be familiar with from the events of the first movie. SCP-3922-A hold a brief conversation with Borat on the events that unfurled following Borat&#39;s release from the rehabilitation clinic in the first film. The prisoners are hauled into aircrafts similar to SCP-2578-D and taken away to not be seen again. The film continues as normal, however, of note is that Borat&#39;s character is depicted as much more civilized, mannered and culturally literate throughout the movie despite holding on to most of his original characteristics.
**Note:** //This test shows us that SCP-3922-affected mediums are capable of displaying consistency if they are set in a shared universe or inhibit shared characters. In addition to this, seeing Borat actually being polite to other people was the most hilarious thing I had the pleasure of witnessing all day. Requesting further testing be done regarding this matter.// - Dr. Chair
//...We already tried experimenting with SCP-3922 and shared universes Alan. You should try actually reading the log before adding anything to it.// - Dr. Edison
//You should try shutting the fuck up Michael.// - Dr. Chair

**Subject:** //Salad Fingers//, Episode 1 “Spoons”, 2004, Unrated
**Interference Point:** Entire episode.
**Result:** Instances of SCP-3922-A deploy via dropship and proceed to apprehend Salad Fingers and admit him into a mental asylum. The rest of the episode consists of the titular character recovering from his mental state through methods such as psychological therapy with an instance of SCP-3922-A medical personnel, usage of a medication labelled as “Tactical Anti-Hallucinogenics”, peer support involving multiple SCP-3922-A instances, with a significant change in the appearance of the episode to display the main character’s rehabilitation and his severe hallucinations recovering as a result. By the end of the episode, Salad Fingers is displayed as an ordinary human being working at an office building, fully integrated into society. The episode’s credits are preceded by the Three Moons title card accompanied by the words, “Mental stability is of utmost importance.”

**Interference Point:** None, test canceled  
**Result:** None, test canceled
**Note:** //There is no telling how SCP-3922-A would react to this. What if it gets consumed, or even worse, spread?// -- Dr. Une

**Subject:** The security camera footage for [[[d-7294-s-declassified-d-class-survival-guide | D-7294]]]&#39;s holding unit, narrated by Doctor ████████.
**Interference Point:** Beginning. D-3331 was instructed to fire at the first SCP-3922-A instance that made an appearance using [[[SCP-674]]].
**Result:** Before he could fire, D-3331 was killed in a spontaneous Impaler Event by SCP-2578-D. In addition to seizing and violently beating D-7294 to death for serial femicide, SCP-3922-A proceeded to declare war on the SCP Foundation in the name of the Three Moons Initiative for attempting to assassinate one of their agents. The rest of the footage was transformed into a 5-hour-long action-war movie based on a large-scale military conflict between the TMI and the SCPF.[[footnote]]Experiment was halted at this point, however, removing SCP-3922 from the area resulted in all personnel overseeing the experiment (including the security guards observing from the surveillance equipment) to be suddenly assassinated in successive Impaler Events. The rest of the film was recorded via security cameras.[[/footnote]] The film&#39;s continuity is occasionally interrupted by Doctor ████████&#39;s narrating which informs the viewer on the status of the two main belligerents of the conflict and the updated casualty count for both sides. After 3 years of fighting, the large scale mass destruction of 25% of the Earth&#39;s infrastructure and 12% of the total landmass of the extradimensional location known as SCP-2922-C; the two organizations agree to sign a truce, ceasing the fighting on a military stalemate. The title card which appears during the ending credits is accompanied by the words; &#34;YOU&#39;RE PROTECTED, BUT NOT LOVED. YOU WERE LUCKY THAT YOU ARE NOT WORTH IT.&#34;
**Note:** Cross testing between SCP-674 and SCP-3922 is forbidden and Doctor ████████ has received serious posthumous reprimanding for suggesting this test.

//I don&#39;t understand why everybody I&#39;ve talked to is so calm about this subject. There is nothing funny about the results of this test, I don&#39;t care if you think the fighting sequences were &#34;rad&#34;, just think about it: If the Three Moons Initiative was willing to declare war on us just because we tried to kill one of their agents, why didn&#39;t they do it in real life and spent all those resources on a war between themselves and a fictionalized version of the Foundation? There are two obvious answers to this://

//1. The TMI had an incredible opportunity in their hands upon being introduced to an exact replica of our current timeline. Imagine how many resources they developed and collected during 3 years of intense warfare. Furthermore, the unprecedented scale of damage SCP-2922-C suffered during the conflict is enough to seriously piss them off, so we cannot make sure how willing they are now to use all the new stuff they&#39;ve acquired.//
//2. The Three Moons Initiative knew that the SCP Foundation is a potential rival organization due to the unmatched military power possessed by both entities. They simply saw this as an opportunity to simulate how an actual war between the Foundation and the TMI would go if it were to [[[scp-7157 | ever occur]]].//

//Please refrain from testing using live footage until further notice. **Personnel reading this is to consider it a warning.** I do not want to witness any further cases of severe unprofessionalism similar to the ones I&#39;ve described above.// - Dr. Chair
