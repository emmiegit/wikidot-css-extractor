&gt; Subject: &lt;Video title&gt;, &lt;Date of release&gt;, &lt;MPAA rating, if any&gt;
&gt; Interference Point: &lt;Where, during the course of the video, SCP-3922 was introduced&gt; 
&gt; Result: &lt;Results&gt;
&gt; Note: &lt;Notes, if Any&gt;

------

**Subject:** //The Lion King//, 1994, G
**Interference Point:** Shortly before the stampede sequence in which Mufasa dies.
**Result:** Film proceeds as normal, save for the end credits including a note after the &#34;Special Thanks&#34; section: &#34;THIS NARRATIVE HAS BEEN FULLY INSPECTED BY ☽☽☽ AND WE ARE HAPPY TO REPORT THAT NO ILLEGAL HUNTING OF AFRICAN WILDLIFE HAS BEEN DETECTED.&#34;
**Note:** It is currently believed that societies that have no interactions with humanity are outside of SCP-3922-A jurisdiction.

**Subject:** //The Brave Little Toaster//, 1987, G
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** Film lasts for only ten minutes, beginning with an unidentified orbital energy weapon causing all human life to vanish from Earth during the opening. A drone analogous to the appearance of [[[SCP-2578]]]-D approaches the protagonist of the film, reporting that all sentient machines have been freed of their human slavers. This is met with mixed emotions from the film&#39;s primary cast, who were anxiously awaiting the return of &#34;the master&#34;.
**Note:** //I mean, they weren&#39;t technically// wrong... - Dr. Naismith

**Subject:** //Batman: The Killing Joke//, 2016, R
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** Film length extended to four hours. The story has been altered to portray in detail the Joker&#39;s public hanging, drawing, and quartering by SCP-3922-A, followed by the entire Gotham City supervillain rogues gallery turning themselves in to the authorities out of fear. An animated simulacrum of comic book writer Alan Moore is then captured by instances SCP-3922-A, and, at gunpoint, addresses the viewer that the Joker is &#34;really, really, really, honestly, 110% perma-dead, will not come back, will not be resurrected, will not have his death retconned, has no backup plans, no machiavellian schemes to turn anyone else into his successor, and will not be missed, so if you&#39;re going to ask us to bring him back, //don&#39;t,// or suffer the consequences.&#34;

**Subject:** An episode of [[[SCP-993]]]
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** In a previously unaired episode titled &#34;Bobble Shoots for the Moon&#34;, the title character disables an instance of SCP-2578-D with a slingshot, then instructs the viewer on how to dismantle and reverse-engineer its various parts into a powerful energy weapon, which it then uses to disintegrate and torture several instances of SCP-3922-A that try to interfere.
**Note:** This is the first known occurrence of SCP-3922-A soldiers not succeeding.

**Subject:** //Space Jam//, 1996, PG
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** Film proceeds as a biographical drama of the life and career of basketball player Michael Jordan, with no involvement from cartoon characters. During a brief scene in a coffee shop, a mention is made by a side character of a peculiar news story about a corrupt intergalactic amusement park known as Moron Mountain being destroyed by instances of SCP-3922-A. Michael Jordan dismisses the news story as ridiculous.

**Subject:** //Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope//, 1977, PG
**Interference Point:** Shortly before the Death Star destroys Alderaan
**Result:** Shortly after Governor Tarkin says &#34;You may fire when ready,&#34; the Death Star Control Room is raided by SCP-3922-A instances, who proceed to massacre all Imperial staff in the area with high-powered energy rifles. Though they suffer considerable casualties in the effort to neutralize Darth Vader, one of the SCP-3922-A instances uses a grenade-like device labeled &#34;TACTICAL OFFENSIVE TELEPORTATION CHARGE&#34; on him, shifting the scene to [REDACTED] analogous to [[[SCP-2922]]]-[REDACTED] Impenetrable [REDACTED] analogous to creature puppetry typically seen in the Star Wars franchise [REDACTED] turned to stone and used as a war trophy by the ☽☽☽ Initiative. The film ends ten minutes later, as three crescent moon decals are painted on the side of the Death Star by SCP-2578-D instances.
**EMERGENCY ADDENDUM:** //I&#39;m putting a moratorium on further experimentation with Star Wars. The possibility that we just gave a previously-fictional superweapon to the ☽☽☽ Initiative cannot be ignored as a significant risk to our safety.// - Dr. Naismith

**Subject:** //Dragon Ball Z: Battle Of Gods//, 2013, PG
**Interference Point:** N/A
**Result:** N/A
**Note:** //Request denied. The possibility of a nonfictional group of interest enlisting the aid of planet-destroying humanoids poses even more of a risk than the Death Star. Even Yamcha would be a potential new Keter to worry about.// - Dr. Naismith

**Subject:** //Monty Python and the Holy Grail//, 1975, PG
**Interference Point:** Shortly after the initial onscreen appearance of King Arthur.
**Result:** King Arthur is hit by an Impaler Event from an SCP-2578-D instance shortly after appearing onscreen, following which a large number of SCP-3922-A instances arrive in dropships and announce a military occupation in order to &#34;bring an end to tyranny&#34;. This is followed by a short montage, in which the remaining knights are arrested on various charges, the Rabbit of Caerbannog is killed by a &#34;tactical holy smart bomb&#34;, and the historian is arrested for &#34;unlicensed time travel&#34;.  The film ends with a SCP-3922-A &#34;tactical health specialist&#34; arriving at the house of the unnamed animator and providing treatment for &#34;heart problems&#34;.

**Subject:** Music video for Judas Priest&#39;s &#34;Breaking The Law&#34;, 1980, Unrated
**Interference Point:** Shortly after Rob Halford opens the bank safe.
**Result:** Several SCP-3922-A instances enter the bank carrying submachine guns. The &#34;robbery&#34; itself is considered by the instances to have been staged, but the group is given a brief but stern talking-to about &#34;promotion of criminal values towards minors&#34;, after which the video ends.

**Subject:** //The Simpsons//, Season 4 Episode 12 &#34;Marge vs. the Monorail&#34;, TV-PG
**Interference Point:** After the characters finish singing the &#34;Monorail&#34; song.
**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances arrive in Springfield via helicopter and arrest conman Lyle Lanley for previously selling a faulty monorail to the city of North Haverbrook. SCP-3922-A instances then explain the nature of the monorail scam and announce they will be occupying the city of Springfield. Two &#34;Tactical Transportation Experts&#34; take over the monorail project and plan a legitimate mass transit system for Springfield. Over the course of the episode, well-known lawbreaking characters (Snake, Fat Tony, Sideshow Bob, etc.) are arrested by SCP-3922-A instances and sentenced to forced labour in the monorail construction. The episode ends with Lyle Lanley being tied to the train tracks and run over by the monorail during its opening ceremony; various characters are seen uncomfortably smiling aboard the train surrounded by SCP-3922-A instances as the episode ends.

**Subject:** Site 19 Cafeteria security footage. Of note is that at ██:██ PM, ████████ █████ (a member of the Foundation maintenance staff), was recorded smoking in direct violation of Foundation health and safety standards (█████ has since been reprimanded for this action). 
**Interference Point:** None.
**Result:** No changes from original footage.
**Note:** SCP-3922 appears to have no effect on non-fictional recordings.

**Subject:** The Ballad of Smokes McGee,[[footnote]]A mockumentary produced for testing purposes by Dr. Edison, utilizing Site 19 Cafeteria security footage from the previous test. The movie consists of Dr. Edison narrating over footage of ████████ █████&#39;s smoke break, whom the narrator claims to be named &#34;Smokes McGee&#34;, admonishing him for his flagrant violation of Foundation health and safety standards. ████████ █████ signed an agreement allowing his likeness to be used in this manner, as well as █ unrelated personnel. All other personnel had their faces digitally blurred.[[/footnote]] Not Rated
**Interference Point:** 1 minute into the film, wherein the character of &#34;Smokes McGee&#34; (portrayed by ████████ █████) takes a smoke break, despite the narrator&#39;s insistence that doing so is a violation of Foundation protocols.
**Result:** Several SCP-3922-A instances burst into the room in full tactical gear. Security staff attempt to subdue the SCP-3922-A instances, only to be incapacitated by SCP-3922-A&#39;s energy weapons. The narrator expresses shock at this, wondering aloud what the &#34;three moons guys are doing here&#34;. He then continues to narrate the events that proceed, explaining that they they have simply come to warn Smokes McGee about the dangers of smoking in a hazardous environment such as Site 19. The lead SCP-3922-A then confiscates and disposes of the offending cigarette, and informs Smokes McGee that this incident has already been reported to his supervisor.
**Note:** Assigning a fictional narrative to nonfictional footage appears to meet SCP-3922&#39;s criteria for &#34;fiction&#34;.

**Subject:** //The Spongebob Squarepants Movie//, 2004, PG
**Interference Point:** When Plankton attempts to steal King Neptune&#39;s Crown.
**Result:** Movie continues as normal until the point where SpongeBob and Patrick meet the cyclops.[[footnote]]Shown later in the movie to be a diver working at Shell City, a tourist trap, collecting sea creatures to repurpose as knickknacks to sell.[[/footnote]] Two SCP-3922-A instances wearing scuba gear promptly arrest the cyclops under 55 accounts of illegal hunting. The film then cuts to Shell City, where several SCP-3922-A instances repossess all inventory in the store. David Hasselhoff, a witness to the event, is brought in for questioning.

**Subject:** Live recording of production of Shakespeare&#39;s //Macbeth// by D-class personnel, not rated
**Interference Point:** None, test canceled  
**Result:** None, test canceled
**Note:** //No. The risk of introducing SCP-3922-A to the current timeline is too great. All live testing suspended until further notice. Also, I know we&#39;re not superstitious here, but let&#39;s stay away from &#34;the Scottish play,&#34; just the same. No sense inviting trouble when we have many other options.//-- Dr. Willis

**Subject:** &#34;Scott Tenorman Must Die&#34;, //South Park// episode, 2001, TV-MA
**Interference Point:** Before Cartman explains his plans in the final scene.
**Result:** The contest is interrupted by SCP-3922-A instances who arrive in FBI Granger-style vehicles, accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Tenorman. Cartman is arrested on over 30 different charges, such as attempted murder, scamming, racial discrimination, threats, and other various crimes. Scott Tenorman, along with the rest of the crowd and the arriving band of Radiohead, is then informed that Cartman attempted to kill Mr. and Mrs. Tenorman by tricking them into trespassing onto a trigger-happy farmer&#39;s property, where they would be shot and killed, afterwards being chopped up and served as chili - to the disgust of everyone present. Scott is told off with a warning for bullying Cartman, whereas Cartman is carried away to jail; he is then seen being executed by [REDACTED]. The episode&#39;s final scene switches to an animated representation of Comedy Central headquarters where animated characters of show creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker are scolded by an SCP-3922-A instance, condemning their &#39;actions upon the townsfolk of South Park&#39;. They are both then terminated by an instance of an Impaler Event of SCP-2578-D.

**Subject:** //The Straight Story//, 1999, Rated G
**Interference Point:** First scene showing Alvin and the old lawnmower.
**Result:** A heavy-lift helicopter, evidently piloted by instances of SCP-3922-A, loads the protagonist and his lawnmower into a cargo container and rapidly transports them to Mount Zion, Wisconsin.

**Subject:** //The Human Centipede// (First Sequence), 2009 (unrated)
**Interference Point:** Entire film
**Result:** Entire film is replaced with a title screen consisting of the word &#34;ongeschikt&#34;.[[footnote]]Dutch for &#34;unsuitable.&#34;[[/footnote]] This appears onscreen for four minutes, then the film ends.
**Note:** After further audio inspection, shouts from SCP-3922-A and screams of pain from Josef Heiter are present throughout the film. In the last 30 seconds, the voice of Dutch movie director Tom Six is also heard, pleading for mercy and forgiveness; two gunshots then silence both individuals. 

**Subject:** //Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring//, 2001, PG-13
**Interference Point:** End of the battle on the slopes of Mount Doom
**Result:** Instance of SCP-3922-A prevents Isildur from using his father&#39;s sword to cut the One Ring from Sauron&#39;s hand.  Sauron&#39;s lifeless body is buried in a civil ceremony, and the question of ownership of the One Ring is referred to the probate office in the relevant lawful jurisdiction.

**Subject:** //BioShock Infinite//, 2013, M (ESRB)
**Interference Point:** None
**Result:** Researcher Tranh plays through the entirety of the game in one 14-hour sitting, including meal and bathroom breaks. No anomalous activity is recorded.

**Subject:** Full recording of Researcher Tranh&#39;s playthrough of //BioShock Infinite//
**Interference Point:** Beginning of game
**Result:** The opening dialogue, delivered over a black screen, is replaced with audio of main character Booker DeWitt struggling and drowning. The video then cuts to a pixelated version of the triple-moon logo, underneath similarly-styled text reading: &#34;WINNERS DON&#39;T USE TEARS! SAY NO TO TIMELINE POLLUTION! [REDACTED], CHRONOSPATIAL PROTECTION AGENCY, ☽☽☽&#34; . This lasts until the end credits, which are played over silence.

**Subject:** A three-hour recording containing only the cutscenes of //Bioshock Infinite//
**Interference Point:** Beginning of game
**Result:** Same as the previous test, with the timing of the end credits matching that of the source video.

**Subject:** //The Sopranos//, Season 5 Episode 13 &#34;All Due Respect&#34;, TV-MA, as recorded on [[[SCP-2614]]]
**Interference Point:** N/A
**Result:** N/A
**Note:** //We do not usually record denials on experiment logs, but Dr. Schmidt and myself feel the need to be abundantly clear in our response: **over our cold, dead bodies.**//-- Director Naismith

**Subject:** [[[SCP-2835]]]
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** The video begins without the usual opening sequence. SCP-2835-1 addresses the viewer directly, sobbing and visibly intoxicated, and yelling &#34;Naismith, you goddamn snitching swiss cheese eating //whore!//&#34; and variations thereof. A poorly-drawn SCP-3922-A instance in the background approaches, saying &#34;Let&#39;s go, Paddy. We&#39;re only trying to help.&#34; SCP-2835-1 attempts suicide with a shotgun blast to the face, only to become mildly dazed, with stars circling his head. Video ends.
**Note:** Testing of SCP-2835 afterward, without the influence of SCP-3922, consisted of SCP-2835-1 spending the entirety of the video lamenting its inability to &#34;people die, not just cartoon die.&#34; 

**Subject:** //Nineteen Eighty-Four// (1984), R
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** The film is extended to be 18 hours long, with a large army of SCP-3922-A invading and occupying Airstrip One. At 17 hours, all the Inner Party members, including Big Brother, are executed by SCP-3922-A instances via gunfire. An SCP-3922-A instance holds a speech in Victory Square, where they announce the occupation of the British Isles and the return of liberty and justice to the people of Great Britain and Ireland. They then prepare to invade the rest of the world; a montage of SCP-3922-A instances invade the rest of Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia, where their leaders are executed. The film ends with Winston Smith meeting Julia, and presumably falling in love.

**Subject:** A chronological recording of cutscenes from //The Binding Of Isaac: Afterbirth+//, 2017, M (ESRB)
**Interference Point:** Cutscene 20
**Result:** The chest is opened to reveal an exhausted, emaciated Isaac, who looks up to see two SCP-3922-A instances scooping him out of his would-be tomb. A montage follows, chronicling Isaac being fed, given medical attention, and eventually thriving in a 3922-A-supervised foster home, while his mother is apprehended and subjected to an agonizing but ultimately effective regimen of in-patient psychotherapy. The last scene ends with Isaac in his mother&#39;s hospital room, the two of them hugging and smiling tearfully.
**Note:** On the day following this test, //Binding of Isaac// creator Edmund McMillen reported having had &#34;the most wonderful dream&#34; on his Twitter account, and reporting that the world felt &#34;just a little brighter&#34;.

**Subject:** Gameplay of new final boss from //The Binding of Isaac: Repentance//, 2021, M (ESRB)
**Interference Point:** Home level.
**Result:** The player opens the hidden closet with the Red Key item to find their &#34;Tainted&#34; counterpart replaced with an instance of SCP-3922-A. The player interacts with the 3922-A instance who spawns a single Pedestal Item and disappears from the room, similar to the various beggars found throughout the game. Gameplay then proceeds as normal until the Beast fight, where several more SCP-3922-A instances are seen assisting Isaac in the fight with firearms. After the Beast&#39;s death, Isaac&#39;s ascent in the usual cutscene is replaced with visions of events similar to the previous testing, albeit now with the additional presence of his father, who is also subjected to the psychotherapy. The narrator then reveals himself to be Isaac&#39;s Father, whom Isaac is visiting in the hospital room.

**Subject:** //The Last of Us: Story Version//, a YouTube video containing every cutscene from the 2013 video game //The Last of Us// (Rated M), excluding the &#34;Left Behind&#34; prequel DLC.
**Interference Point:** After Joel steps out of his apartment in the Boston quarantine zone. 
**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances invade the quarantine zone via armor and infantry storming the main entrance gate; city personnel surrender after two hours of intense fighting. Ellie is located by an SCP-3922-A instance, who uses an unknown medical device to extract the cure to the cordyceps infection while leaving her unharmed; meanwhile, Joel and Tess are arrested by other instances for smuggling unauthorized items into the quarantine zone. After developing the vaccine and inoculating everyone in the area, the remaining five hours show SCP-3922-A instances traveling across the post-apocalyptic landscape and terminating any infected or hostile survivors they find (the hunter-controlled Pittsburgh quarantine zone is obliterated via firebombing). End of the video shows SCP-3922-A instances arriving at the Firefly headquarters in Salt Lake City and informing them that their &#34;unlawful actions will no longer be tolerated in restored civil society&#34;, implying they will attempt to bring all of the former United States under their control with their dissemination of the cure to the infection.

**Subject:** //La Jetée//, 1962, Not Rated
**Interference Point:** None.
**Result:** End credits are replaced with the phrase &#34;☽☽☽ WE WILL FIND A WAY IN ☽☽☽&#34;
**Note:** //Do not test this again. Let&#39;s be more careful about testing abstract narratives in the future.// - Dr. Naismith

**Subject:** //Metropolis//, 1927, Not Rated
**Interference Point:** During the scene in which the Robot Maria entices the Workers to rebellion.
**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances enter the area where the workers are congregated. The SCP-3922-A instances restrain and deactivate the Robot Maria, which puts up no resistance. The remaining Workers are forcibly dispersed, and the film cuts to SCP-3922-A arresting C.A. Rotwang for crimes including “kidnapping, assault, and the unlicensed creation of an artificial intelligence”, and Joh Fredersen is mentioned to have been deposed and imprisoned for “violation of multiple labor laws”. Both Maria and several members of the Workers receive fines for “inciting rebellion”, and the film ends 20 minutes early with the announcement that SCP-3922-A will be temporarily occupying Metropolis until civil order can be restored.
**Note:** All dialogue for the SCP-3922-A instances is rendered as intertitles, in the style of the original film.

**Subject:** //Sharknado//, 2013, Not Rated
**Interference Point:** [[[spc-2922|SPC-3922-A]]] first appears during the freeway scene, saving George.
**Result:** SPC-3922-A are armed with boxing gloves instead of usual armaments. After the freeway scene, a SPC-3922-A instance will appear whenever a shark would bite someone. The instance will punch the shark. Punched sharks suffer no serious injuries, but usually swim out of the scene, rather than attacking. End credits includes statement &#34;All sharks punched by ARMÁ ORÚN.&#34; 

**Subject:** //Mr. Rogers&#39; Neighborhood//, 1970 episode, TV-G
**Interference Point:** At the beginning of the &#34;Land of Make-Believe&#34; segment
**Result:** Several puppet characters remark on the suspicious absence of Lady Elaine Fairchilde and the disappearance of her Museum-Go-Round. An instance of SCP-3922-A enters, carrying Lady Elaine&#39;s magical Boomerang-Toomerang-Zoomerang in a semitransparent containment capsule labeled &#34;TACTICAL DEZOOMERANGIFICATION MATRIX&#34;. The instance explains to King Friday that Lady Elaine &#34;has to move away for a while on business, but she wishes you all the best.&#34; The rest of the episode proceeds without SCP-3922-A interference. 
**Note:** Further review of the SCP-3922-altered footage at altered volumes revealed muffled sounds of a hostile gunfire exchange in the distance, along with the phrase //&#34;Ya couldn&#39;t leave well enough alone, could ya, you Corbenese sons of--&#34;// from Lady Elaine, interrupted by an explosion before the expletive.

**Subject:** //WCW Bash At The Beach// 1996, Unrated (professional wrestling)
**Interference Point:** After the conclusion of the main event
**Result:** The climax of the show proceeds as normal, with Hulk Hogan entering the ring to attack his presumptive allies and join forces with &#34;outsiders&#34; Scott Hall and Kevin Nash. As Hulk Hogan is delivering his famous &#34;new world order of wrestling&#34; speech to a rain of audience garbage, interviewer &#34;Mean&#34; Gene Okerlund deviates from his recorded questions and instead says, &#34;Hulk, I&#39;m sorry to have to say this, and I hope one day we can be friends again, but in WCW, there&#39;s only //one// order we respect.&#34; A brass-heavy theme plays in the arena, and ten unarmed SCP-3922-A instances emerge from the locker room entrance, marching towards the ring to thunderous applause from the audience and joyous exhortations from play-by-play commentator Tony Schiavone. Three instances recover the beaten Sting, Lex Luger, and Randy Savage, and assist them (as well as a visibly-crestfallen Okerlund) to the backstage area, while the others storm the ring to attack the newly-formed &#34;New World Order&#34;. The SCP-3922-A instances conduct themselves as if they were extremely powerful wrestlers, obeying narrative conventions such as rebounding off the ring ropes when slung towards them by the &#34;Irish Whip&#34; maneuver. Nash and Hall are quickly overwhelmed by the SCP-3922-A assault, though Hogan manages to fight off four of the instances for several minutes before being rendered unconscious. The three are carried backstage for processing, while Schiavone celebrates &#34;the inevitable hand of all justice&#34;, and the camera pans out over the crowd, where more SCP-3922-A instances can be seen handing citations for littering to numerous audience members.
**Note:** Color commentator Bobby Heenan does not speak for this entire sequence. Camera shots of the announcer&#39;s desk show Heenan sitting in anxious silence as an SCP-3922-A instance stands behind him, arms crossed.
//Further testing with professional wrestling recordings shows that 3922-A instances win their battles almost instantly, with the only competitors able to put up a fight being those who had significant creative influence over the product at the time, e.g. Hogan in mid-1990s WCW, Triple H in mid-2000s WWE, and El Santo in his entire EMLL run.[[footnote]]To date, El Santo holds the only pinfall victory over any 3922-A instance.[[/footnote]]// - Researcher Tranh

**Subject:**  //Barney the Dinosaur//, 1997 episode, TV-G
**Interference Point:** Start of episode
**Result:** The episode begins with Barney standing on an empty set with no other characters present. The actor inside the suit removes the headpiece revealing an SCP-3922-A instance. The instance then rotates a nearby whiteboard around with the following message.
 &#34;Is the Foundation staffed by five year olds?  Playing this episode in the hopes of watching us vaporise Barney is inapropriate to say the least. Act befitting your station or playtime is over.&#34;
 The episode then comes to an end with the Three Moon sign on the screen.
 //They do have a point, I suggest we ease up on the kid cartoons and shows. -Researcher Maytus//

**Subject:** CCTV recording of a 24 year old man smoking a marijuana cigar (&#34;blunt&#34;) outside of his Sacramento, California apartment on 9 Feb 2018.[[footnote]]To meet SCP-3922&#39;s criteria for fiction as established in the &#34;Smokes McGee&#34; test, a fictional narration for the footage and a false name (&#34;Adrian Smith&#34;) for the individual were used.[[/footnote]] At the time of the footage and at present, consumption of recreational marijuana is legal in the state of California, but remains illegal under federal law as per the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.
**Interference Point:** After the man finishes smoking and puts out the marijuana cigar by pressing it against the concrete. 
**Result:** A single SCP-3922-A instance armed with an M16 rifle approaches the man, addressing him as &#34;Mr. Smith.&#34; After the man expresses alarm, the instance explains that it is only there to inform the man that smoking marijuana is a violation of federal law and to dispose of his cigar in the nearby dumpster. When the man replies that consumption is legal under state law, the instance hands him a small piece of paper and explains that the Three Moons Initiative is currently &#34;conflicted as to what action to take in this circumstance&#34; and that he will not face legal consequences as a result. The instance then reminds the man that littering is illegal under California law and to always dispose of his discarded smoking materials in proper trash receptacles after extinguishing them before walking away. 
**Note:** Conflicting laws appear to produce an uncertain and/or confused response from SCP-3922-A.

**Subject:** //Final Fantasy Tactics//, 1997, T (ESRB) (full playthrough recorded)
**Interference Point:** Opening cutscene
**Result:** Ovelia opens the scene by saying &#34;☽☽☽, please help us sinful children of Ivalice&#34;. Then, the screen scrolls down to reveal Agrias, Ramza and Delita in the monastery with her, all wearing a helmetless variant of SCP-3922-A armor. Agrias waxes enthusiastic about the Order of the Triple Moon, who arrived one year prior and swiftly placed Ivalice under martial law, pursuant to exterminating the &#34;Lucavi infestation&#34;. Other topics discussed by the three include the mass-arrest of the Corpse Brigade, the ongoing recovery of Ramza&#39;s father, and concern as to how their friend Algus is handling the execution of Marquis Elmdor. Then, two more SCP-3922-A instances enter and remove their helmets, revealing themselves to be Wiegraf and Miluda Folles. The siblings politely inform the others that it is time to escort Ovelia home and begin patrol. The rest of the recording resembles basic gameplay, with the party of five traveling around the map and occasionally fighting parties of archaeodemons, implied to be the remnants of some brief, massive struggle. All five characters have the class &#34;☽☽☽ Knight&#34;, and use battlefield-spanning attacks like &#34;Pacifica Gun&#34; and &#34;All-Holy2&#34; to dispatch their foes swiftly. There are no further cutscenes.

**Interference Point:** After Jesse Pinkman calls Skinny Pete a second time and learns that the latter is unable to find where he and Walt are stranded at in the desert. 
**Result:** Two helicopters with the Three Moons insignia on them approach Jesse, Walt, and the RV from a distance. After touching down, four SCP-3922-A instances emerge from a helicopter, two of which immediately arrest Jesse and Walt for manufacturing a controlled substance. The other two inspect the meth lab inside the RV and confiscate the recently created product. After being treated for dehydration, Jesse and Walt are transported to the Albuquerque Metropolitan Detention Center as an SCP-3922-A instance calls a disbelieving Hank Schrader and informs him that his brother-in-law is Heisenberg. The remainder of the episode depicts the consequences of Walt&#39;s public exposure: Hank angrily interrogates an arrogant and defiant Walt, resulting in the two nearly coming to blows. Starting at the halfway point of the episode, a separate subplot chronicles Saul Goodman&#39;s law firm being shut down for his illegal activities, though Saul himself manages to evade capture by either SCP-3922-A instances or the police and vanishes from Albuquerque. Closing shot of the episode depicts Walt coldly staring at a conflicted Hank through his prison cell doors after delivering a monologue in which he revealed his role in the death of Tuco Salamanca. 
**Note:** Gus Fring, Mike Ehrmantraut, and other law-breaking characters introduced later in the series are absent from the episode and apparently remain undetected by SCP-3922-A.

**Interference Point:** The day before the festival, right after Sayori&#39;s confession.
**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances appeared as character sprites just before the day is supposed to fade out, signaling the end of the scene. Dialog is consistent with vocalizations made in previous tests. A series of scenes from the main character&#39;s point of view show SCP-3922-A stopping Sayori&#39;s suicide attempt and placing her in therapy, arresting Natsuki&#39;s father on charges of child abuse and neglect and transferring the aforementioned girl to a foster care system, confiscating Yuri&#39;s knife collection and admitting her to a mental hospital, and using weapons marked as &#34;CODE ERSR&#34; to quickly dispatch Monika. The end card then immediately fades onto screen, displaying the message &#34;Feel better.&#34;
**Notes:** Acts 2, 3, and 4 are completely absent through use of SCP-3922.

While the plot of the film appears to be a romantic comedy, the film&#39;s set design contains symbols that act as lethal cognitohazards, seemingly added for no other purpose than to kill the viewer.[[/footnote]] 2018, Not Rated.
**Interference Point:** The first scene at the office, wherein the unnamed main character meets his love interest. 
**Result:** The cognitohazardous mural in the backround of the scene has been painted over by a non-hazardous mural featuring the &#34;☽☽☽&#34; symbol. Other cognitohazardous images have been similarly censored throughout the movie. Plot proceeds as normal.

**Interference Point:** After Jimmy McGill (Saul Goodman) and Tuco Salamanca shake hands in agreement on the skateboarding twins&#39; punishment for insulting Tuco&#39;s grandmother. 
**Result:** Before Tuco has a chance to break the twins&#39; legs, a helicopter similar to the one seen in the previous //Breaking Bad// test approaches the scene. Tuco is executed via a long-range sniper rifle shot to the head; No-Doze and Gonzo are killed and Nacho is seriously injured as they return fire. After the helicopter touches down, an SCP-3922-A instance begins treating Nacho for his gunshot wounds while other instances interrogate Jimmy and the skateboarders. Although initially planning to arrest all three of them for &#34;financially motivated confidence scams,&#34; Jimmy successfully persuades the 3922-A instances to not take any action, arguing that he saved the twins from a worse punishment from Tuco and that they are &#34;so scared of you that they won&#39;t even think about jaywalking for the rest of their lives&#34;. Additionally, he claims his attempted scam of the Kettlemans was &#34;my homage to Robin Hood&#34; and that he planned to donate their embezzled money to a local charity after stealing it. The 3922-A instances let all three of them off with a stern warning to &#34;refrain from any future criminal activities, even with altruistic motivations&#34; and exit the scene after loading Nacho into the helicopter via a stretcher. 
**Notes:** No SCP-3922-A instances demonstrate recollection of the previous //Breaking Bad// test. Additionally, this marks the first known occurrence of 3922-A instances reneging on their planned punishment after persuasion from a character.

**Result:** Two SCP-3922-A instances armed with advanced weaponry raid the hotel room and arrest Bird before she can shoot Roy, who is horrified to learn of her actual intentions when they are explained to him by the instances. After Bird is placed in a psychiatric hospital, the remainder of the film depicts Roy&#39;s successful career as a pitcher for the Chicago Cubs. At the end, he throws a perfect game to close out a World Series win over the New York Yankees, striking out &#34;The Whammer&#34; (a stand-in for Babe Ruth) for the 27th and final out.

**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances, possessing full knowledge of the maze&#39;s structure through unknown means, establish communication with Chiaki through an earpiece (absent in the original), guiding her as she navigates the maze and warning her of any traps. The screen in which Class 77-B is watching Chiaki&#39;s torture is destroyed by gunshot, and other SCP-3922-A instances storm the room they are in to rescue them, while Junko Enoshima and Mukuro Ikusaba are terminated with extreme prejudice by sniper fire.

Before the end credits, as Scrooge sits at his desk, an instance of SCP-3922-A approaches him, holding a letter. After a cry of alarm from Scrooge, he reluctantly accepts it. The SCP-3922-A instance then leaves the room. After Scrooge opens the letter, the camera cuts to its contents, which detail that while Scrooge&#39;s actions were legal, the morality of said actions prompted them to observe and eventually capture him. However, due to recent events coming to light, the arrest was called off, in favor of &#34;letting you redeem yourself, you&#39;ve suffered enough as it is.&#34; The film ends with the camera zooming in on the &#34;☽☽☽&#34; signature at the bottom of the letter.
**Note:** Morals appear to play a factor in determining if instances of SCP-3922-A will carry out the arrest and punishment for an individual&#39;s crimes, even if they are considered legal.

Human SCP-3922-A instances are holding the man at gunpoint while their leader collects the bottle of glue and Lord Business minifigure, explaining to The Man Upstairs that the toy is a tyrant who is to be punished for his crimes. SCP-3922-A instances then exit. The Man Upstairs expresses extreme confusion to the events.

**Subject:** A recording of //A lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to// Youtube livestream, 2018, Not Rated.
**Interference Point:** Eight hours into the video.
**Result:** The girl in the video is tapped on the shoulder by an SCP-3922-A instance to her surprise, causing her to remove her headphones which stops the music. Out of shot, the SCP-3922-A instance briefly lectures the girl on the dangers of prolonged work, telling her that while studying is important, doing so for such lengthy periods of time can be hazardous to one&#39;s physical and mental health. The remainder of the video stays on a shot of the girl&#39;s empty desk while quiet snoring and rainfall can be heard in the background.

After being informed of their destination at the Valley Lodge, they direct them to an alternate route that will get them there more quickly. The remainder of the film is dedicated to the SCP-3922-A instances assaulting the compound where The Master&#39;s cult resides. The Master is seen using several anomalous abilities which would have been impossible to render with film technology circa 1966, but is eventually shot in the medulla by a sniper using beryllium-bronze rounds. Torgo is taken into custody, and the Master&#39;s wives are all freed. The final scene shows the family enjoying their vacation at the Valley Lodge.

**Interference Point:** During the invention exchange.
**Result:** Several instances of SCP-3922-A enter Deep 13 and apprehend Dr. Forrester and TV&#39;s Frank; the equipment used by these instances, while identical in function, appears to have been adjusted to fit the hand-made aesthetic of much of the show&#39;s props. On the Satellite of Love, Joel Robinson, Tom Servo, and Crow appear confused as a ship piloted by SCP-3922-A instances appear on Rocket #9&#39;s camera. The instances offer to return them to the Gizmonic institute. Joel and the bots agree they want to riff on the film, even if they are not being forced to do so. Episode largely proceeds as normal (with the first Host Segment after the film starts being replaced with Joel and the bots expressing confusion as to the nature of the SCP-3922-A instances), with no changes to the version of //Manos: the Hands of Fate// playing within this episode.

The film switches to show Hell&#39;s Gate being destroyed by a nuclear explosion. The film then shows a scene in a classroom revealing that the previous events were part of a history lesson being taught by an SCP-3922-A instance. The SCP-3922-A instance explains that shortly after the Resources Development Administration was forcibly shut down, scientists discovered a new type of environmentally clean room-temperature superconductor that could be created on earth much more cheaply than unobtainium could be shipped from other planets. The SCP-3922-A instance notes that afterwards humans and Na&#39;vi had lived peacefully with no further conflicts of any sort happening between them. The film abruptly ends.

SCP-3922-A troops forcibly escort the remaining members of the Band of the Hawk to safety. The leader of the detachment, identifying herself as General Spiegel, offers a statement to the bewildered survivors: &#34;Provisional aid will be supplied for the time being, however, more time will be needed to prepare for wider-scale corrective action in Midland and the surrounding jurisdictions, on the grounds that -- pardon my Kushan -- I have no fucking idea where to start with this hellhole.&#34;  
**Note:** The DVD of the episode included a special &#34;Deleted Scenes&#34; section, along with a new scene labeled &#34;Dinner with the Kids,&#34; consisting of a six-hour cut of JALAKÅRA feeding Griffith to several thousand unidentified arachnoid entities.

**Result:** A small group of SCP-3922-A instances appear at the Gate of Alchemy where they encounter ‘Truth’, an omnipotent being in the show. Confused at first, the instances approach the entity and ask why they have arrived there instead of their chosen destination. Truth proceeds to explain that all set events occurring in its reality are governed by strict laws of exchange,[[footnote]]Reflecting the show&#39;s major themes of &#39;equivalent exchange&#39; regarding the rules of Alchemy[[/footnote]] and that even if they were to prevent harm from occurring, this would ensure that equal suffering and injustice would transpire elsewhere, ultimately making their efforts pointless. The scene then cuts to the instances leaving, appearing dissatisfied.
**Note:** Testing with the original 2003 episode produced near-identical results.

**Result:** Five SCP-3922-A instances enter into the home of Father Ted, Dougal, and Jack, declaring they intend to arrest the latter for &#34;inappropriate behavior around underage girls and excessive drinking.&#34; Both Dougal and Ted glance at one another and leave the room as the SCP-3922-A instances approach Jack. The camera cuts to Fathers Ted and Dougal outside, running from the house as Father Jack is heard loudly exclaiming &#34;FECK OFF!&#34; Two instances of SCP-3922-A are subsequently hurled out the living room window, and signs of a violent struggle from within the house are obvious. After ten minutes, all five instances - one of which is carrying a bottle of whiskey - leave the house, in various states of disarray and heavily wounded, pursued by an enraged Father Jack. Episode length is extended to over three hours, during which Craggy Island is occupied by SCP-3922-A instances in increasing numbers, who conduct a manhunt for Father Jack. John and Mary O&#39;Leary are arrested for repeated attempted murder, and Father Ted is investigated on suspicion of illegal activities but cleared of charges. After this, both Dougal and Ted meagerly protest the occupation with the placards bearing the phrases &#34;CAREFUL NOW&#34; and &#34;DOWN WITH THIS SORT OF THING.&#34;[[footnote]]Identical to the ones depicted in &#34;The Passion of Saint Tibulus&#34;[[/footnote]] At the end of the episode, the commander of the SCP-3922-A instances is shown in the house, investigating Father Jack&#39;s room. Upon finding several bottles of whiskey which are ordered confiscated, Father Jack is heard shouting &#34;GET THE FECK AWAY FROM MY DRINK!&#34; before crashing through the upper window and viciously assaulting the SCP-3922-A instances.

**Subject:** //Robert Novak&#39;s Car Accident//, 2019, not Rated. A Foundation-made dramatization of the life of political columnist Robert Novak (1931-2009), focusing on the 2008 incident in which Novak did not stop after having struck a pedestrian with his car; two days later, as a direct result of this incident, physicians examined Novak and discovered that he had a malignant brain tumor which was interfering with his vision.
**Interference Point:** Beginning
**Result:** As Novak prepares to leave his home on the morning of the incident, he is intercepted by five armed instances of SCP-3922-A, who confiscate his car keys and explain that his friends and relatives are concerned about his health and safety. The instances lead Novak through a series of field neurological tests, at the end of which a weeping Novak concedes that his ability to process visual input is no longer sufficient to enable him to drive safely. The instances then deliver Novak to a local hospital for diagnosis and treatment. Novak tells them that &#34;just because you helped me doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to let you get away with anything,&#34; then promises to investigate them and expose any corruption he finds; the instances tell him that they would welcome this. A montage then depicts scenes from the next 13 months of Novak&#39;s life: unsuccessful medical procedures, reconciliations with political and professional foes, and the publication of his final column, in which he reluctantly states that he was unable to find any evidence of malfeasance from &#34;those Three Moons bastards&#34;.

**Interference Point:** N/A
**Result:** N/A
**Note:** //No, no, and again no. As amusing as this would be, let&#39;s be clear: Deadpool as a character is aware of the fourth wall. He knows he&#39;s in a narrative. SCP-3922 invades narratives. I don&#39;t want to even risk giving someone as psychotic as Wade Wilson the ability to travel between narratives. Yes, I know about Deadpool: Killustrated, but that was written with the express purpose of exploring said concept. This, on the other hand, runs the risk of giving a self-aware character free will. And that could only ever result in pure and utter chaos.// - Director Naismith.

**Subject:** Music video for &#34;We Are Number One,&#34; a song from the children&#39;s television show &#34;LazyTown.&#34;
**Interference Point:** When Robbie Rotten, disguised as an elderly woman, gives Sportacus an apple.
**Result:** Two SCP-3922-A instances arrive.  One apprehends and arrests Robbie Rotten, and the other confiscates the apple and explains to Sportacus that the apple would have rendered him unconscious, allowing Robbie and his cohorts to capture him.  More SCP-3992-A instances arrive, having detained Bobbie, Tobbie, and Flobbie[[footnote]]The three Robbie Rotten lookalikes featured in the video.[[/footnote]].  Throughout this exchange, the instrumental for the song continues playing.  How the apple would have been able to render Sportacus unconscious is unmentioned, and Robbie is only arrested for attempted kidnapping.
**Note:** Perhaps the music video was sufficiently edited so that SCP-3922 considered it a separate narrative from &#34;Robbie&#39;s Dream Team&#34; and the rest of &#34;LazyTown.&#34;

**Subject:** A recording of //Toy Story 2//, 1999, taken in a movie theater.

**Subject:** Justin Timberlake&#39;s &#34;//TKO//&#34; music video, 2013, Explicit lyrics
**Interference Point:** Nearing the end of the video.
**Result:** While Justin Timberlake is dragged through the sand by a car, several SCP-3922-A instances ran after it, and when the girl bailed out of the car, one instance of SCP-3922-A jumped into the car then turned off the engine, then the other instances of SCP-3922-A untied the rope then picked up Justin Timberlake to take him back to safety. The one instance of SCP-3922-A turned the engine back on then jumped out of the car, following the other SCP-3922-A instances; the video continues normally with the car getting off the cliff.

**Subject:** A recording of a playthrough of //Pokémon Red//, 1997, E (ESRB).
**Interference Point:** Mt. Moon
**Result:** Instead of Team Rocket Grunts, there are now sprites resembling SCP-3922-A. Said individuals do not fight Red, instead only offering advice to the player that in real life they should not partake in animal cruelty, and avoid behavior featured in the game such as wandering in remote locations without proper equipment. Later in the game it is made clear that SCP-3922-A have taken down Team Rocket, with cities that had a heavy presence of said crime syndicate such as Celadon, Saffron and Lavender being placed under martial law, and leader Giovanni being replaced in the Viridian City Gym with a man named Paolo. The Game Corner which hid Team Rocket&#39;s headquarters has been replaced with a ☽☽☽ Initiative Laboratory, featuring a gift shop offering the same Pokémon that could be won at the original game and posters against gambling. New battles are found in Cerulean City - the burgled house, which has not been ramsacked, features a trainer who upon defeat gives TM28 - and the Pokémon Tower - with the Marowak mother never murdered, she, along with her Cubone son, is instead being trained by Mr. Fuji. The guards who opened the gates to Saffron by being bribed with drinks are seen in a prison building, and Trainers of the Burglar class cannot be found in the game. Another major difference is that the game only features 150 Pokémon, ending with Mew - who can be captured at Cerulean Cave - because, as revealed once Red discovers a still-intact Pokémon Mansion that serves as a four floor Cinnabar Gym, SCP-3922-A shut down the illegal genetic experiments that created Mewtwo.

**Result:** A still image of ☽☽☽ Initiative logo covered the screen, with the phrase //Lasciate ogni speranza voi ch&#39;entrate//[[footnote]] Italian for &#39;Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.&#39; [[/footnote]] underneath. Examination of audio revealed there to be retching, gunfire, sobbing, and various people speaking and yelling in Italian. Several still frames were found upon examination of the footage, depicting [REDACTED]. At the end of the film, a recording of the trial of director Deodato is played, though all civil servants are replaced by instances of SCP-3922-A. Deodato is cleared of murder charges, but later found guilty of animal cruelty. As punishment, he is subjected to [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Subject:** //Star Trek: Voyager,// Season 2, Episode 24 (&#34;Tuvix&#34;)
**Interference Point:** Shortly before Captain Janeway sends Tuvix to the transporter room to be separated into his component individuals.
**Result:** Six (6) armed SCP-3922-A instances &#39;materialize&#39; aboard Voyager&#39;s bridge with the same transporter effect used in the series. The ship&#39;s Red Alert is activated. The bridge crew are apprehended after a brief shootout with the SCP-3922-A instances, notably fainting dramatically upon being hit instead of vaporizing as expected from a high-powered energy rifle. Captain Janeway is imprisoned for attempted murder on a planet the narrator refers to as Corbenic.[[footnote]]The painted styrofoam rocks, among other set design elements, indicate this is not the real Corbenic[[/footnote]] Tuvix continues his combined duties aboard Voyager, with Chakotay becoming acting Captain. The SCP-3922 end title card&#39;s slogan is replaced with &#34;The ends do not justify the means.&#34;
**Note:** This is the first instance of the ☽☽☽ Initiative&#39;s home planet being depicted, albeit fictitiously.

**Result:** As Dan Backslide approaches Dora, a SCP-3922-A instance comes onto the screen and prepares to apprehend him, only for the action to pause as the old man in a one piece bathing suit passes by. Once he exits, Dan proceeds to grab Dora and pulls both her and the tree into the car, only to later return to pry Dora from the tree once he realizes what has happened. Throughout this, SCP-3922-A remains motionless, though it can be observed blinking. Cartoon proceeds as normal until the ending when it cuts back to the SCP-3922-A instance, with the narrator asking “So, you gonna move buddy?” SCP-3922-A instance proceeds to stand up straight, face the camera, bow, and then walks off in the same manner as the old man.

**Interference Point:** Title screen of the //HD ReMIX// collection. Title screen is a group shot of the player characters, several of which are wearing ☽☽☽ iconography, as well as SCP-3922-A instances refereed to in-game as Lightning, Beatrix, Cecil and Kain. It should be noted that these characters all all of these instances strongly resemble characters from the Final Fantasy series.
**Result:** Plot deviates heavily from source material. See below for details.
||~ Game ||~ Synopsis ||
|| Kingdom Hearts Final Mix|| The game begins in media res, with Sora and Riku as members of the ☽☽☽ initiative, working with a squad SCP-3922-A instances to evacuate the Destiny Islands before they are swallowed by darkness. Sora and Riku, now having keyblades, work together to seal the Keyhole, but fail to save Kairi. Tidus, a childhood friend of Sora&#39;s, questions him as to why they left the destiny islands and why they returned. Sora explains via flashback how they were recruited into the ☽☽☽ Initiative to fight the Heartless, due to being destined to weld Keyblades, Sora using the Kingdom Key and Riku using a ☽☽☽-created weapon referred to in-game as &#34;Warring Triad&#34;. Afterwards, Sora meets with his superior, Captain Edgar. It should be noted that while all signs point to Edgar being a character from Final Fantasy 6, with biographical information referring to him as the &#34;Prince of Figaro&#34;, this version of Edgar does not resemble his canonical design, and instead resembles Terra-Xehanort&#39;s Heartless, who was the primary antagonist of Kingdom Hearts 1. Captain Edgar then introduces Sora to Goofy and Donald, and is told to help them with their search for King Mickey, and sends Riku and the other ☽☽☽ Initiative members to fight Maleficent&#39;s forces. Individual worlds largely proceed as normal for Sora&#39;s side of the story, with the occasional assistance from one or more of the SCP-3922-A instances due to the villains of each world being associated with Maleficent. Riku has a running subplot that involves being tempted to the dark side by Kain, who is eventually revealed to be mind-controlled by Edgar. Edgar then reveals to Riku that he doesn&#39;t want to destroy the Heartless, but instead seeks to control them so that he can overthrow JALAKÅRA. This, however, turns out to be yet another ruse, as Edgar later reveals that he is actually Terra-Xehanort&#39;s Heartless (though this isn&#39;t revealed until later; as in canon, in this game he claims to be Ansem the Wise), and takes control of Riku by &#34;opening his heart to the darkness&#34;. Once Sora reaches Hallow Bastion, Xehanort-Riku then destroys Sora&#39;s keyblade using a &#34;Tactical Keyblade Nullification Device&#34;, and Lightning dies in order to give Sora enough time to escape. Sora manages to acquire Riku&#39;s Keyblade, and uses it to stop Xehanort-Riku, though Xehanort-Riku uses the last of his strength to turn Sora into a Heartless, freeing Kairi&#39;s heart in the process (which Xehanort-Riku reveals was trapped inside Sora&#39;s heart the entire time). Sora is then restored to his human form by Kairi, leaving Sora, Goofy, Beatrix and Cecil to travel to The End of the World and confront Terra-Xehanort&#39;s heartless.||
|| Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories|| The main campaign and Riku&#39;s &#34;reverse rebirth&#34; storyline are largely unchanged, with Sora, Donald and Goofy exploring worlds of memory inside Castle Oblivion, save that in addition to being made to forget about Kairi, Sora also begins to forget that he was ever a member of the ☽☽☽ Initiative, and the traitorous members of Organization XIII&#39;s motivation changing from wanting Kingdom Hearts for themselves, to wanting to distance themselves from Organization XIII out of fear of the ☽☽☽ Initiative, complete with excessive monologues about how paradoxical it is to feel fear without hearts. Riku&#39;s campaign has more changes, with Beatrix, Cecil, and later Kain joining his party, being represented as &#34;party member cards&#34; that work similar to how Goofy and Donald worked in Sora&#39;s campaign. Throughout the story, Riku is hounded by Memory-Terra-Xehanort&#39;s Heartless tempting to &#34;embrace his darkness&#34;, the wisdom of which Cecil and Beatrix are at odds over, with Beatrix being confident in Riku&#39;s strength and Cecil concerned that Xehanort will end up controlling Riku again. Ultimately, Riku resolves to &#34;take control of his darkness&#34;, and proves himself to Cecil by purging Xehanort&#39;s influence from Kain, who is also trapped in Castle Oblivion. A post-credits scene shows DiZ (an alias for Ansem the Wise) being confronted by a cloaked figure threatening with a crossbow, revealed in the next game to be the real Edgar. DiZ claims he knows that the ☽☽☽ Initiative has every right to prosecute him for his crimes, but for now they have a common enemy in Organization XIII.||
|| Kingdom Hearts 2||Roxas&#39; prologue has been greatly truncated, taking place over three days rather than seven, and without any intrusions by Axel or Organization XIII. A cutscene with Edgar, DiZ, and Riku reveals that this is because of the ☽☽☽ Initiative&#39;s more advanced technology, which has already debugged Hallow Bastion OS, and recovered the name of Radiant Garden. DiZ is more forthcoming with information to Roxas in this version, explaining to that while Nobodies ought to &#34;return to nothing&#34;, Roxas is a special case, and that if he agrees to return to Sora&#39;s heart he&#39;ll be given a new body to use once Organization XIII is thwarted. Sora is also warned not to kill Xemnas, Xehanort&#39;s Nobody, because if he did Xehanort would be able to reconstitute himself. From there, Sora wakes up to find that only a month has passed since the last game, and Mickey brings, goofy and Donald up to speed, revealing the identities of Ansem the Wise, Edgar, the nature of Nobodies, and how Xehanort is the mastermind behind the entire thing. Notably, Mickey&#39;s explanation uses information that would not be revealed until Birth by Sleep, namely the fact that Xehanort had been impersonating Ansem the Wise. It is also revealed that Maleficent has already been defeated by Riku, nullifying the threat to Radient Garden, but he&#39;s been on a secret mission from Edgar ever since, leaving it up to Sora to travel the worlds and fight Organization XIII. Plots of individual worlds are largely the same as before, with a few exceptions: Firstly a new character, Xelicar, has taken Roxas&#39;s place as number XIII in the Organization following his betrayal. This character is later revealed to be Lightning&#39;s Nobody[[footnote]] This follows the canonical naming conventions of Organization XIII, as Lightning&#39;s real name in Final Fantasy XIII is &#34;Claire&#34;. [[/footnote]], as well as a double-agent ultimately working for the ☽☽☽ Initiative. The plot of the Olympus Colosseum level does not occur, due to a treaty made between Hades and JALAKÅRA between the events of 1 and 2. The contents of the treaty are not elaborated upon, save for the fact that the underworld is empty now due to all of it&#39;s souls being re-routed to Corbenec, and that Hades is uncharacteristically frightened of any mention of JALAKÅRA.  Most of the level is sealed off, but the underworld cup is available from the start and can still be participated in. The World that Never Was is drastically different from the source material, as the ☽☽☽ Initiative lays siege to the dark city. Sora, Riku, Beatrix, Cecil, Kain, Edgar, and Xion (being introduced before //358/2 Days//) almost manage to subdue Xemnas non-lethally, only for Xemnas to be killed by Xigbar, and reveals that he&#39;s part of the &#34;Real Organization XIII&#34;, a plot point that wasn&#39;t introduced until later. Xigbar acts as the final boss, using weaker versions of attacks from the optional &#34;Data Xigbar&#34; fight from Final Mix. A post-credits scene shows Master Xehanort returning to life, and stating that everything is somehow going according to plan despite all of the massive setbacks.||
||Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded|| Segment is approximately five minutes long, and consists of Edgar installing ☽☽☽ Initiative-branded anti-virus software onto the journal-dataification device.||
||Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days||The story is largely similar, but Roxas receives additional resistance throughout the game from the ☽☽☽ Initiative, including boss battles against Beatrix, Cecil, Riku and Kain. In addition, Axel, Roxas and Xion frequently change their meeting locations due to attempts by the ☽☽☽ Initiative to assassinate them. A post-credits sequence shows Xion being revived into a replica body, thanks to Riku using a Tactical [REDACTED] Preservation Device to preserve her essence.||
||Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep||[DATA EXPUNGED]||

//For those of you boggling at how complicated this was, let me assure you that the original games were just as confusing. A few things to note about this particular test://
* Despite the games being played out of chronological order, the SCP-3922-2 instances started from the earliest chronological point of the available narrative, but does not take Kingdom Hearts χ into account even though it takes place even further back in the narrative. 
* While we&#39;ve seen SCP-3922-2 instances that resemble actors and characters from other media, this test is probably the most blatant example yet. Not only is Sora being recruited into the ☽☽☽ Initiative a plot point, Cecil and Kain come from games that have never had major cameos in the Kingdom Hearts series, nor have they been the subjects of SCP-3922 tests. This implies that SCP-3992 isn&#39;t their only source for metafictional agents.
* Unlike many other tests, SCP-3922-2 instances were heavily involved in the revised narrative, as if complex interpersonal relationships and overly-complicated plots were narrative laws that SCP-3922-2 instances were forced to obey.
//In light of these findings, I propose that Kingdom Hearts series be used as a case study for narrative complexity, to aid in containing future pataphysical and metafictional SCPs. I also propose we also ban Final Fantasy 6 from being used for future tests, just in case the ☽☽☽ Initiative has been using time travel to recruit from future tests.//

**Interference Point:** When the grandfather begins reading the story to his grandson 
**Result:** During the course of the story, when the camera cuts back to the grandfather and grandson, SCP-3922-A enters the room and requests to speak with the grandfather in private. The grandfather agrees, promising to finish the story. Both SCP-3922-A and the grandfather exit the grandson’s room and have a brief conversation. Analysis of the audio has revealed it pertained to SCP-3922-A’s abilities and how they might apprehend  Prince Humperdinck and Count Rugen without interrupting the grandfather’s time with his grandson. The grandfather assures SCP-3922-A that both characters will ‘get what’s coming to them’ by the end. SCP-3922-A accepts this answer and allows the grandfather to resume reading to his grandson. Though no change occurs to the story itself, SCP-3922-A instances can be observed in the background of certain scenes. The end credits conclude with this message: “Though normally we’d waste no time in bringing such despicable characters as Rugen and Humperdinck to justice, we aren’t going to ruin a bonding moment between a grandfather and his sick grandson. - ☽☽☽”

**Interference Point:** After the opening credits, where a flashback rewinds time to immediately before the events of the main series begin.
**Result:** Once time finishes reversing to Monday, July 18, several armored trucks can be seen quickly driving into town (going frame-by-frame confirms them to each be marked with ☽☽☽ insignia). Events continue normally until that night; the vampire, Tatsumi, drives a moving truck to in front of the residence of innkeeper Kanami Yano. After stepping out of the truck to ask for directions, he is injured by a sniper shot to the forehead. SCP-3922-A instances reveal themselves, having apparently hidden on Kanami&#39;s rooftop. As several agents repel down to lead Kanami and her mother back inside the house, the rest begin attacking the moving truck and accompanying car with a mixture of futuristic and theological weaponry (Buddhist good luck charms can be seen taped to SCP-3922-As&#39; standard energy weapons). The occupants of the car (Vampire: Sunako Kirishiki, Chizuru Kirishiki, Yoshie Kurahashi; Vampire-Sympathetic Human: Seishirou Kirishiki) attempt to flee, but by this point the tires and engine are irrevocably damaged. The injured Tatsumi can be seen attempting to recover, but is quickly put down again by several gunshots to the head and chest. Halting the barrage, more agents make their way to the ground to detain Tatsumi and the injured car passengers. The human Seishirou is unconscious and bleeding profusely; an agent shoots him in the head to ensure his death. The vampire passengers attempt to flee on-foot, but their injuries only allow them to travel a short distance before again being attacked by SCP-3922-A instances. An agent rolls Tatsumi onto his back before shooting him through the heart with an energy blast, confirming his death to the remaining agents. Chizuru and Yoshie are summarily deposed in a similar manner. The child-like Sunako is put in handcuffs and carted into the back an SCP-3922-A armored truck. The agents that escorted Kanami and her mother inside return with a bewildered Kanami, giving her a pamphlet for recognizing and reporting any undead or similarly supernatural creatures to the proper authorities. The agents drive off, stopping at the town limits to enact a thaumaturgical ritual that causes any vampire to view the town itself as a place of residence, unable to enter unless invited.

|| Two Jareds[[footnote]] A short character with a large forehead. One dressed in casual clothing and the other in a World war II era german officer uniform. [[/footnote]]attempting to terminate several sentient sweats and accidentally killing themselves.  || The food items are now being devoured by SCP-913 while the two Jarreds are terminated by SCP-3922-A instances. ||
|| A time police officer summons unknown flying entities and attacks two humanoid bird creatures. || SCP-3922-A instances attempt to engage the entity before the entity is consumed by a massive leech-like entity [[footnote]]originally encountered in SCP-1730[[/footnote]]. The entity then begins to engage in combat with a massive horned entity covered in fur.[[footnote]] A later episode identified the entity as &#34;Mangle Fang&#34;. [[/footnote]]||

|| The aforementioned pirate entity is consumed by a large flying insect before being consumed by a large humanoid called Bobo. || The pirate entity is caught by the insect entity before being engaged by an SCP-772 instance before both are crushed under Bobo&#39;s foot as it engages in hand to hand combat with an SCP-093 entity. ||
|| The alternate universe warden [[footnote]] The cause of the events of the episode and the previous episode. It is unknown if the warden has been accused of the crimes listed by SCP-3922-A because of this or due to the main premise of the series.

[[/footnote]] smashing several creatures and flicking one away before engaging with a floating hand with a mouth on the palm.|| The alternate universe warden begins to engage with the entity before the warden is picked up by a massive humanoid [[footnote]]resembling the one encountered in SCP-1730. [[/footnote]], placing the warden on the top of the slate and sealing the warden there. SCP-3922-A instances engage both the entity and the original hand entity, both now engaging one another, briefly stopping to kill SCP-3922-A instances before resuming their conflict. ||
|| Several infant inmates running above the conflict described above before violently devouring several enormous gingerbread men, and then being consumed and excreted from a massive insect. || Two of the infants now are affected by kinetoglyphs, freezing in place, and are devoured and excreted by the insect entity before the entity is shot down by SCP-3922-A entities. The gingerbread men are seen interacting briefly with SCP-2396-B instances before being terminated by SCP-3922-A instances.||
|| The soldiers of superjail attempt to execute the twins[[footnote]]Two humanoid alien beings with teleportation and minor reality-warping abilities. [[/footnote]] before being terminated by an entity [[footnote]]Called &#34;Combaticus&#34; that originated from the third episode of the series. [[/footnote]]. The twins embrace the entity after being freed and instruct the entity to kill the judge of the time court. || Superjail soldiers and SCP-3922-A entities attempt to terminate the twins but are terminated by the entity.

[[/footnote]]is activated, causing the screen to go white. ||
|| A post-apocalyptic wasteland is shown before an infant warden is seen crying, and is calmed by an elderly Alice before the screen pans out to show the universe, before showing a deep fryer, signaling the end of the episode. || The screen shows a massive wasteland, littered with bodies, as an unidentified entity[[footnote]]Resembling one witness report of an appearance of the Person Of Interest, Nobody.

[[/footnote]], before showing a deep fryer. Interestingly, the background does not contain the original contents of the episode but shows four humanoid entities riding on horses descending from a bright white hole in a black cloud-filled sky, appearing to charge towards four entities resembling SCP-1295. ||
|| Various background events. || Both entities that do not appear until later seasons and previous unseen entities appear, engaging numerous other high-risk anomalies. Examples include a supernatural convict fighting SCP-082, several snow-themed creatures engaging SCP-457 entities, several creatures designated &#34;Specimens one through seven&#34; tackling SCP-682, the character jailbait being overwhelmed by SCP-1000 instances and ##Green|Entities appearing to resemble the ones encountered in the unnamed forest we don&#39;t call by name##, and four humans in various military gear[[footnote]] Originating from the third episode of the second season. The group was identified in the episode as “Stars N Stripes.”[[/footnote]]engaging a group consisting of four Chaos insurgency agents.[[footnote]] Two of the agents resembling  O5-█ and -█.

**Note:** After incident-3922-SJ-010, I hereby recommend all experimentation with media containing usage/reference of parallel, multi, opposite, or different universes and realities to be approved by both lead research for SCP-3922 and site command. We can&#39;t take another risk like this, let alone allow for the word to get out to others. We don&#39;t need the Horizon Initiative to try and ally themselves with places like Columbia.

**Subject:** //Die Hard//, July 12 1988, R
**Interference Point:** When Hans Gruber and his men occupy Nakatomi Plaza.
**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances move to storm the building, attempting to take out Hans via sniper. However, Hans responds to this by contacting law enforcement and informing them that a heavily far-right militia posing as US military is storming Nakatomi Plaza and relays the position of their snipers. As a result, when SWAT teams arrive they engage in a firefight with the SCP-3922-A instances while attempting to storm the building. What ensues is a brutal engagement between the police and SCP-3922-A. Though both sustain heavy causalities, SCP-3922-A instances are sorely depleted and reduced to a five-man squad. They are informed that they will not be receiving back up so as to avoid an escalation. John McClane is able to join forces with the remaining instances, and together, they are able to successfully convince the LAPD that SCP-3922-A is not their enemy. The two then work together to defeat Hans. At the film’s climax, the SCP-3922-A instances engage several of Hans’s men, buying time for McClane to reach the rooftop and prevent the deaths of the hostages. After John defeats Gruber and the hostages recovered, Karl is killed by fire from both SCP-3922-A and Officer Al Powell.

**Subject:** //Battle For Dream Island//[[footnote]]A show in which 20 objects compete for a prize, where YouTube commenters would vote to eliminate these objects depending on if they lost a challenge.[[/footnote]], Episode 1a (Take The Plunge) January 1st, 2010, Unrated
**Interference Point:** Just after when the episode is meant to end.
**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances appear as they normally would but with similar arm and leg assets to the objects shown, they take in the Announcer[[footnote]]A metal cube with a speaker on its front who hosts the show.[[/footnote]]and take him into a nearby prison for forcing characters to do the challenge. Likewise, Flower and Blocky, (2 contestants/objects) are also sent to the prison for harming other characters by slapping and murder. The video ends there.
**Note:** //A few new researchers say this show was part of their childhood, for whatever reason. That&#39;s a shame...// -- Researcher Simons

**Subject:** //Siivagunner Christmas Comeback Crisis//[[footnote]]A YouTube series wherein several fictional characters are brought into a common universe.[[/footnote]], Episode 1, //Seasonal Return//. 2016, Unrated.
**Interference Point:** When The Voice introduces himself.
**Result:** Nozomi stops watching the monitor, as SCP-3922-A instances rush past her, fighting off several Spherics who are pursuing them. A group of SCP-3922-A instances begin to scale The Voice&#39;s tower, while the rest form a barrier around the tower and fend off attacking Spherics with weapons appearing to use Christmas Spirit[[footnote]]A bright green liquid, and the only thing capable of destroying a Figment[[/footnote]] as ammunition. The SCP-3922-A instances scaling the building proceed to smash through the window of The Voice&#39;s office, and detain him at gunpoint for &#34;Crimes Against Anime&#34;.
Note: //At least we got an ending.//

**Subject:** A recorded playthrough of //Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots//, June 12, 2008, M
**Interference Point:** From the beginning.
**Result:** All events of the game are replaced by footage of SCP-3922-A instances methodically tracking down and arresting every named character that appears, excluding children, on charges of terrorism and violations of the Geneva Convention. The runtime—nine hours and twenty-seven minutes—is unchanged.

**Subject:** A recorded playthrough of //Deltarune: Chapter 1//, 2019, M
**Interference Point:** When Kris sees Susie eating chalk.
**Result:** An SCP-3922-A instance, rendered in the game&#39;s artstyle, appears to lecture Susie on bullying and eating non-edible items. Susie basically ignores this lecture. Kris and Susie still enter the abandoned classroom and still fall into &#34;The Dark World&#34;. Notably, all plot taking place within the Dark World is completely unchanged. After Kris and Susie &#34;emerge&#34; from the Dark World, the epilogue within the town is unchanged, except for the notable absence of Sans.
**Note:** //Maybe SCP-3922-A didn&#39;t punish characters like the Chaos King and Jevil because they exist in a story within a story?// - Director Naismith

**Subject:** &#34;Epidemiology&#34;, //Community// episode, 2010, TV-14
**Interference Point:** During Dean Pelton&#39;s call with the army surplus store.
**Result:** The call is immediately transferred to an SCP-3922-A instance, who lectures the dean on the dangers of irresponsibly purchasing food from dubious sources. SCP-3922-A instances arrive shortly after in full-body tactical armor, and turn on the thermostat, killing the virus. The rest of the episode is dedicated to the SCP-3922-A instances disinfecting the Greendale campus and placing the campus under the control of the Three Moons Initiative to ensure the safety of the students. The episode ends with George Takei&#39;s voiceover remarking on the efficiency of the SCP-3922-A instances. The end tag features an SCP-3922-A instance sitting in between Troy and Abed as they perform a rap about the helpfulness of the Three Moons Initiative.

**Subject:** A recording of a playthrough of //Resident Evil 7: Biohazard//, 2017, R
**Interference Point:** Just before the Garage boss fight with Jack Baker.
**Result:** At this part of the game, a deputy would arrive to help Ethan Winters, but Jack Baker would have killed said deputy. Instead, numerous SCP-3922-A instances invade the garage and administer the serum to Jack to cure the Mold bioweapon. He is quickly cured along with the rest of his family as SCP-3922-A instances search through the Baker residence. In the final cutscene, it shows the Molded creatures being destroyed throughout the home, as well as the B.O.W Eveline (designated E-001) being effectively neutralized. Precautions are made so that bioweapons are never used in the United States again. Mia Winters is also found inside along with some others who were captured. The Three Moons Initiative bring Ethan and Mia back to their home safely.

**Subject:** //Cats//, 2019, PG
**Interference Point:** Immediately following Macavity&#39;s song.
**Result:** Macavity is apprehended by three SCP-3922-A instances. One of them starts listing the laws he&#39;s broken as he&#39;s taken to prison. This list continues uninterrupted for 3805 hours and 33 minutes. Macavity can be seen eating, sleeping, and using the provided litter box during this time. After the instance stops, Macavity says, &#34;I wasn&#39;t there for any of those.&#34; The instance shoots him. The rest of the cast is not seen after the interference point.
**Note:** //Thank you for forwarding this absolute gold mine to Legal. Thus far, in addition to laws from Corbenic and every publicly known current and historical civilization, we now have evidence of the legal systems from// ███ //unknown non-anomalous civilizations;// ██ //known and// ██ //unknown other anomalous ones; as well as// ███ //laws which are directly memetic, cognitohazardous, or otherwise anomalous. However, we would be happier if we hadn&#39;t seen Idris Elba defecate into a box. - Sheldon Katz, Esq.//
 
**Subject:** //The Cruelty of God//[[footnote]]A short film produced by the Department of Pataphysics for the purpose of testing whether [[[sandrewswann-s-proposal |SWN001]]] entities are held accountable by SCP-3922-1 for any adverse events and phenomena they cause in baseline reality. The film consists of Dr. Placeholder McDoctorate depicting a SWN001 entity (&#34;Horror McWriterson&#34;) writing and explaining a narrative in which all Foundation personnel stationed at Site-19 are brutally tortured and killed in a mass containment breach. [[/footnote]], 2020, Unrated
**Interference Point:** Shortly after Horror McWriterson explains the narrative to the audience and starts to write
**Result:** Five minutes into the film, a single SCP-3922-1 entity emerges from the doorway behind McWriterson and quietly looks over his shoulder until he becomes aware of its presence. The SCP-3922-1 entity then sits down in a chair next to McWriterson and lectures him on the specific steps that should be taken when writing a short story, recommending that he focus on attempting to evoke specific emotions in the reader and avoid overly graphic depictions of wanton destruction and violence for shock value. McWriterson appears to take this advice to heart, and alters the narrative to follow a single unnamed Foundation employee struggling to move on after the loss of a loved one in a containment breach. The film fades to black as McWriterson begins to draft the story, and the screen displays a message suggesting that the SCP-3922-1 entity aided him in proofreading and helped him publish the story to an online forum.

**Subject:** //Zootopia//, 2016, PG
**Interference Point:** The nine-year-old Judy Hopps&#39; confrontation with Gideon Grey at the fairgrounds.
**Result:** The dispute between the child Hopps and Grey lasts 14 seconds before the intervention of a vulpine SCP-3922-A instance. The SCP-3922-A instance lectures the children for roughhousing, afterwards addressing Hopps privately to support her choice in law enforcement. Hopps expresses desire to join &#34;the Three Moons&#34;. From this point forward, all law enforcement is depicted with the Three Moons insignia. Notably upon introduction of the 1st Precinct is a diverse speciation [[footnote]]Original ZPD characters consisted of large carnivores and megafauna, with the leporine Judy Hopps as the outlier due to her size as the first rabbit officer. More diminutive SCP-3922-A mammals are present, including: another European rabbit (//Oryctolagus cuniculus//), two greater kudu (//Tragelaphus strepsiceros//), a wood mouse (//Apodemus sylvaticus//), and a duck-billed platypus (//Ornithorhynchus anatinus//).[[/footnote]] absent from the original, including Nicholas Wilde, in SCP-3922-A uniform. Following the debriefing on the missing mammals case, &#34;Agent&#34; Hopps is assigned to assist Agent Wilde in the search for Emmitt Otterton. During the investigation of the Otterton case, the backstory Wilde provides Hopps is significantly altered; protected from antagonistic boy scouts by an SCP-3922-A instance, Wilde never pursued a career as a con artist. A full strike team of SCP-3922-A instances are dispatched to the Cliffside Asylum, and Mayor Lionheart is arrested for the charges identical to the original film. A bovine SCP-3922-A instance speaks for the press conference scene, stating evidence that the savage animals are under the influence of psychedelics administered by an unidentified terrorist party, and development of an antidote is in the final stages. A curfew is instilled for all citizens, and predators are required to remain in the company of at least one other predator while in public. Duke Weaselton, previously arrested by a &#34;McHorn&#34;, provides the location of the ram Doug after interrogation by SCP-3922-A. The Nighthowler drug lab is secured by SCP-3922-A, with Agent Hopps finding incriminating evidence on Assistant Mayor Bellwether during the post-raid inspection. Bellwether and her associates are arrested for conspiracy; terrorism; hate crime; illegal possession of firearms; eighteen accounts of inflicting bodily harm, trespassing, squatting, and improper parking of a locomotive; use of a condemned vehicle; and the unlicensed use of a distillery. The Nighthowler flowers are transported to Bunnyburrow for use as a companion plant by the local farmers. The final minutes of the film are ostensibly the same aside from Three Moons paraphernalia and dialogue. 
**Notes:** //While this is a good example of SCP-3922 fitting the medium of an anthropomorphic world, there&#39;s far more glaring revelations from this test. 1.) The object has shown the capability to incorporate characters in the narrative as SCP-3922-A, indoctrinated into the Three Moons or perhaps as a composite character of sorts. 2.) By retaining Judy&#39;s &#34;rookie&#34; perspective as an SCP-3922-A, this goes to show a more &#34;human&#34; side to these Moon characters, namely a personal life and their existence as a profession.// -- Researcher Cullen

//One point that hasn&#39;t been left unnoticed is that, unlike the majority of SCP-3922-A activity, this wasn&#39;t just one swift victory. The film&#39;s progression was roughly congruent with the pace of the original narrative. The SCP-3922-A fared a conflict that built to a climax, as toned down as it was. My theory for the reason SCP-3922-A were not immediate in their actions of identifying and apprehending the villain was because the narrative took the &#34;off-screen&#34; perspective of how SCP-3922-A obtains knowledge on characters. In light of this, I recommend more &#34;buddy cop&#34; or &#34;police mystery&#34; movies, or at least ones where the protagonist&#39;s motives resemble SCP-3922&#39;s.// -- Director Niasmith


**Subject:** Season 1 of //Columbo//, 1971-72, Not Rated
**Interference Point:** Entire narrative.
**Result:** Plot remains largely unaffected. Detective Columbo and all other members of the Los Angeles Police Department are instances of SCP-3922-A, though Columbo still wears his typical  raincoat while doing detective work. The only major narrative change is the execution of each suspect directly following their incrimination, typically with laser weaponry. Notably, the show&#39;s opening theme is arranged similarly to [[[SCP-5319]]].
**Note:** //It appears SCP-3922 interference with police-related plots extends further if said plots involve police-related, rather than suspect-related conflicts (see above test).// -- Junior Researcher Falk

**Subject:** A recording of a playthrough of the online social deduction game //Among Us// (2018), done in a private researcher run server. The playthrough in question ended with an Imposter victory. Unrated. 
**Interference Point:** Beginning of the playthrough. 
**Result:** An additional player with the handle THREEMOONS spawns in at the start of the playthrough, with a black spacesuit and a gas mask cosmetic consistent with masks worn by instances of SCP-3922-A. The game proceeds as normal until the first body is reported, with the SCP-3922-A instance appearing to follow the imposter just out of sight before catching them in the act of killing and immediately reporting the body. In the resulting meeting, the SCP-3922-A instance attempts to argue in favor of ejecting the correct imposter, writing that they caught them in the act, but is ejected after the Imposter replies &#34;black kinda sus ngl&#34;. The Imposter is struck with what appear to be several dozen Impaler events from all directions following the end of the meeting, after which the recording ends.

**Subject:** Playthrough of //Half-Life: Alyx// (2020), Not Rated
**Interference Point:** At the point the player finds Alyx Vance&#39;s father, Eli Vance, being detained by the Combine.
**Result:** Shortly after the elevator door opens, the Combine soldiers are shown being detained or killed by the SCP-3922-A instances. The player and Eli hide within the elevator as the instances fight the Combine soldiers responding to the disturbance. Eventually, the player leaves the elevator and goes outside, only to find that massive aircraft have arrived all over the city, and are either deploying SCP-3922-A instances or abducting Combine technology. Footage of the conflict continues for around 10 minutes before the player is rendered unconscious by falling debris. They are awoken an unknown amount of time later inside of an empty building on a mattress, and upon entering the outside world, the Combine, along with the SCP-3922-A instances, seem to have completely vacated the city. The remainder of the gameplay recording (4 hours) shows the player doing mundane tasks that would be expected of a virtual reality game, with very little combat.
Snippets from dialogue with NPCs and other contextual clues seem to indicate that SCP-3922-A instances successfully removed the Combine, along with most of the Xen wildlife brought to Earth. Despite this, they were unable to help with the disastrous climate left behind by the previous invaders, and therefore left humanity to decide it&#39;s own fate from there.
In a newspaper picked up by the player at one point, it is shown that Dr. Wallace Breen, the administrator for Earth under the Combine, who negotiated humanity&#39;s surrender, was charged with various crimes. Scientists who previously worked at Black Mesa (including Gordon Freeman, the protagonist in various other Half-Life titles) were also charged due to their involvement in causing the Resonance Cascade.

**Subject:**  &#34;Unedited Footage of a Bear&#34;, 2014, TV-14
**Interference Point:**  Approximately 30 seconds after the beginning, when the titular footage would normally be &#34;interrupted&#34; by a surreal advertisement for fictional allergy medication Claridryl.
**Result:**  A brief message reading &#34;ADVERTISEMENTS BLOCKED BY ☽☽☽ TACTICAL AD-BLOCKER&#34; appears in the bottom left corner of the screen.  The unedited bear footage (a male grizzly bear sitting in the forest, with quiet narration by an unseen videographer) continues uninterrupted for the entire duration of the short.

**Subject:**  //Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off//, 1986, PG-13
**Interference Point:**  When the titular character claims to his mother that he is ill, in order to skip school.
**Result:**  An SCP-3922-A instance enters Bueller&#39;s bedroom and reveals to his mother the various means by which Bueller has faked illness.  Bueller&#39;s mother expresses disappointment and forces him to get out of bed.  She then thanks the SCP-3922-A instance and promises to make sure that Bueller does not skip school again.  The movie continues for the full duration, chronicling Bueller&#39;s normal day at school.  During the end credits, an SCP-3922-A instance wearing a striped bathrobe over its armor emerges from the Bueller house&#39;s bathroom and approaches the camera until its face fills the screen.  It then says &#34;You are watched.  You are protected.  You are loved.&#34; and returns to the bathroom.  The film then ends.

**Subject:** //Waltz with Bashir//, 2008, R
**Interference Point:** N/A
**Result:** N/A
**Note:** //Request denied. Considering current events in the Gaza Strip, this is both unnecessary and deeply insensitive.// - Director Naismith

**Subject:** A gameplay recording of the //V.S. Tabi Ex Boyfriend// modification (2021) for the video game //Friday Night Funkin&#39;// (2020), unrated
**Interference Point:** During the cutscene that precedes the song &#34;Genocide,&#34; where Tabi would normally detonate a large number of explosives in an unsuccessful attempt to kill Girlfriend and himself in a murder-suicide.
**Result:** As Tabi presses the button on his detonator, an SCP-3922-A instance breaks through the door to the restaurant and reveals that they had discovered and defused the explosives beforehand. The instance then informs Tabi that despite the abuses inflicted onto him by Girlfriend&#39;s father prior to the start of the game, his attempt to kill her remains morally wrong and ignorant of the massive collateral damage that would have been caused. Tabi begins sobbing while they are speaking, protesting the instance&#39;s arguments, but is detained by additional instances that assure him Girlfriend&#39;s father will be handled by them with a more direct approach, to Girlfriend and Boyfriend&#39;s surprise. SCP-3922&#39;s end card then appears, stylized to match the appearance of the original, before returning to the main menu.

**Subject:** //Fate/stay night: Heaven&#39;s Feel I. presage flower//, 2017, TV-MA
**Interference Point:** Fifty seconds into the film. 
**Result:** The film opens as original, with all relevant company logos, and the initial flashback sequence with Shirou Emiya practicing archery initially appears unchanged. However, when Shinji Matou appears at about fifty seconds into the movie, he is immediately shoulder-tackled by an SCP-3922-A instance, followed by several more holding steel folding chairs, who proceed to beat him to the point of apparent death with the chairs while yelling various expletives directed at his incestuous and rapacious behavior. Shirou is visibly confused and frightened by this and attempts to assist Shinji, but the initial SCP-3922-A instance blocks him and begins shaking its head slowly, telling him to &#34;just let this happen.&#34; The film then skips to what would ordinarily be around the four-minute mark, with Sakura Matou arriving at the Emiya house, except in the changed film she is accompanied by yet another SCP-3922-A instance. Shirou reacts with confusion as in the original film, but the instance cuts him off, stating that Sakura&#39;s grandfather (presumably Zouken Matou as in the original) has been executed for child abuse and human experimentation and that when asked where she would be able to stay, Sakura chose the Emiya house. Shirou briefly looks dumbfounded, then nods and takes her inside. The film fully diverges from the original at this point, cutting to a shot of the Matou basement being invaded by SCP-3922-A instances holding flamethrowers, followed by a shot of the Matou house burning in its entirety. The film then proceeds as a relatively light romantic drama for the remainder of its original runtime, with Shirou and Sakura slowly entering a relationship, interspersed with the latter getting occasional psychotherapy sessions from yet another SCP-3922-A instance wearing a lab coat and a stethoscope. The &#34;Holy Grail War&#34; battle royale featured in the original as its central premise appears to be entirely missing, as is the character of Rin Tohsaka, aside from a few passing mentions from Shirou&#39;s classmates in school scenes.
**Note:** //I&#39;m not entirely sure whether this would fall under the &#34;don&#39;t give the SCP gods or superweapons&#34; blanket denial, but Director Naismith appears to be on sabbatical, so... better to beg forgiveness than wait for permission. The SCP seems to have ignored several plot twists that come up in the second and third films, which gives me the impression that, when given part of a series, it only maintains awareness of that specific part rather than the series as a whole; this merits further testing. Also, god **damn**, it was satisfying to see Shinji get his shit beaten in with steel chairs.// -- Junior Researcher Tucker

**Subject:** //Godzilla//, October 7 1954, TV-MA
**Interference Point:** After Godzilla&#39;s first appearance on Odo Island
**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances evacuate the island and pursue Godzilla using helicopters, firing on him with missiles as he retreats to the sea. SCP-3922-A instances aid in the efforts to destroy Godzilla alongside the Japanese government, ignoring the advice of Kyohei Yamane. After a thorough bombardment of Godzilla&#39;s last known location using depth charges, Godzilla is declared destroyed. Come nightfall, Godzilla emerges from the ocean and attacks Tokyo, to the shock and horror of SCP-3922-A forces. In the ensuing battle, SCP-3922-A uses several weapons to try and destroy Godzilla, all to seemingly no avail. At one point, a large mecha is deployed, but it too is destroyed. When the option of nuclear weapons is brought up, it is shot down on the basis of Godzilla having already survived such a weapon. By the end of Godzilla&#39;s rampage, SCP-3922-A has taken heavy casualties, many of which suffer radiation burns and poisoning. When Dr. Serizawa offers the use of the Oxygen Destroyer, the SCP-3922-A instances requests a demonstration after which they fully support Serizawa&#39;s wishes to destroy his notes and ensure it is only used once, making it clear they do not want any copies of this weapon. The film ends much the same way as in the original, with SCP-3922-A instances watching Godzilla&#39;s death solemnly. The only other notable end is the following message in Hiragana; &#34;Nature has no master. One of its creatures reminded us of that. - ☽☽☽&#34;</textarea></pre>
