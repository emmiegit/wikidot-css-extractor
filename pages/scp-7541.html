**Subject:** Orders for today.
[[/div]]
------
First things first, I have received appeals from the crew to sail back to the mainland, despite our mission. While I understand these, and I understand your fatigue, I must remind everyone that Outpost M.01 depends on us, to defend and rescue them. We also need to be here in event that the submersible returns to Outpost M.01, who else will treat and transport your colleagues to safety if not us? Therefore we need to remain steadfast and remain here.
@@ @@
Orders have not changed. You are to remain observant of any approaching vessels. Communication units is to continue attempting to reestablish contact with Site-45. This duty today belongs to Ensign H. Brookes.

++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION 

The documentation you are viewing concerns an ongoing situation. Information within this document may be outdated.

-- Maria Jones, Director, RAISA
[[/=]]
[[/div]]

**Item #:** SCP-7541

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the remote location and relative ease of concealment, it has been ruled that civilian travel within the affected area may continue unabated. Outpost M.01 is to be supplied monthly and the crew rotated on the same basis. A Foundation naval vessel had been permanently deployed within the perimeter of the Mariana Trench. Continuous monitoring implemented until further notice.

All above procedures are subject to change as the situation develops.

**Description:** SCP-7541 is a ten (10) kilometer-deep chamber that had become accessible following the formation of an opening within the seafloor of the Mariana Trench. As a result of this, the current maximal depth of the Mariana Trench is twenty-one (21) kilometers. Geologic analysis suggests the chamber became isolated from the outside world between five hundred forty-one (541) and five hundred thirty-one (531) million years ago, making the formation notably older than most oceanic crust. It is currently unknown how the chamber avoided subduction into the mantle or being crushed by the movement of geologic plates.

SCP-7541 had become accessible following an 8.2M earthquake that occurred on 09/05/2025. Formation of the opening into SCP-7541 was successfully obscured from the general public via the amplification of coverage on the resulting Tsunami waves and the damage caused by thereof. Since 15/05/2025 expanded to [Classified - Level 4 Clearance Required].

Following 05 Council vote,[[footnote]][Classified - Level 4 Clearance Required][[/footnote]] a Foundation outpost had been established within the Mariana Trench on 10/05/2025. Outpost M.01 had been constructed on short notice. Outpost M.01 is an autonomous underwater habitat that had been positioned on a rock outcropping previously known as Challenger Deep.

On 15/05/2025, following an O5 Council vote,[[footnote]][Classified - Level 4 Clearance Required][[/footnote]] a deep-sea crewed submersible was launched from Outpost M.01

Ensign Hal Brookes: No, the interface keeps spewing out error messages since, what was it, 17th of May. Even then, back before that day, when we connected they wouldn&#39;t pick up anyway. I&#39;ve started to question what&#39;s the point of sending us all out here anyway if they weren&#39;t bothered enough to give us up-to date equipment or just pick up the phone.

Ensign Hal Brookes: We were told we&#39;d get changed for a bigger, modern, vessel too, as much as I love the Charybdis, if something more serious than a leak happens our little patrol corvette won&#39;t have the means to handle it. That&#39;s one of the only things that I genuinely fear out here anymore, everything&#39;s else gone numb. How&#39;s it on your end? Still no word from the submersible?

Researcher Alexis Cole: No, I&#39;m afraid, but you&#39;ve read the logs, eh, for what it&#39;s worth, the cable is still taut. As for me, aside from the dwindling supplies, we&#39;re having a headache over seismological readings, if you believed them the entirety of the Mariana-Pacific Subduction Zone, and by extension, the Philippine-Pacific Zone would be getting battered with magnitude 5 and 6 quakes, even if they were correlated to that worm thing, but if that was the case our little rock outcropping would&#39;ve been destroyed. But aside from pulling my hair about that, not too bad yet, and how is it going for you and the rest of the crew?

Ensign Hal Brookes: Bored, extremely so. There&#39;s no civ vessels to talk with, there&#39;s nothing out for miles as far as we can tell up here, shit, even the sea is just flat with no waves at all. The crew, I wish I could say restless I guess, but that stopped being the case for a few days, the atmosphere is stagnant, the morale is resignation, anyone not apathetic is clamoring back for shore.

++ Personal File of: Ensign Hal Brookes.

Today is 24th of June. Supplies in canteen are visibly running thin, even for us. We were supposed to be back at Site-45 weeks ago. I find my thoughts drifting back to those early days of May. We were rushed out in such hurry, to the point of under equipment even. I remember getting only scraps of news before that, anomaly sightings were increasing all over the world in a 24 hour span, green lights, weird beasts bursting from the ground only to retreat back in, a red forest that appeared and disappeared in one night somewhere in Utah.

And then nothing, we sailed out and since then, nothing had come to us. Not news, not communications, not even the messages of our loved ones.

Today we were surrounded by fog, as every other day. Fog and water vapour, as if something below the waves was warming the ocean on which we sail. Today we also did not spot any ships on radar, or comms, visible observation was impossible anyway. Every day, that fact gets more worrying, before all this started, this was a busy part of the Pacific, and now it is vacant safe for us. There are not even sea birds here with us.

I have become the only one who at night looks down into the water, all the others are too uncomfortable to do that. I keep seeing bubbles of air escape the trench, then stop, then begin again, as if breathed out by some giant lung. Sometimes, I could swear at those times I see a glimmer of light from deep there, but I know, I hope, that is impossible.

**Are you certain you want to add a new entry?**
[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop show=+ Yes|hide=- Yes]]
**Saved!**

Today is 25th of June. Outpost is getting irritated too at the lack of supplies and contact. I am looking through the files again, my mind wanders to memories when I lived through these times. The situation is certainly not helped that life onboard is boring at the best of times and my clearance doesn&#39;t allow me to access much more. I pass the day looking through the files I have already read again and again.

I didn&#39;t ask if in the outpost they also see the escaping air from the abyss. I spent the morning looking at the water. I did not imagine it, there is a light flashing down there. Strong enough to be visible in daylight. I do not know how, or why, I don&#39;t want to look at the water again.

**Exploration Video Log Transcript**

**Date:** 18/05/2025

**Exploration Team:** Crew of Outpost M.01 Submersible

**Subject:** SCP-7541

**Team Lead:** Sr. Technician Sam Walker

**Team Members:** Researcher Alan Pauling, Technician Micheal Irwin

[BEGIN LOG]

//Camera shows Sr. Technician Walker against a yellow metal wall.//

**Sr. Technician Walker:** This is the 3rd day of the exploratory mission into SCP-7541. All is going well, the descent is stable, oxygen is stable, and supplies are optimal, but we&#39;re still cramped.

**Researcher Pauling:** You done?

**Sr. Technician Walker:** Yeah, I assume you want the recorder?

**Researcher Pauling:** Yup.

**Sr. Technician Walker:** Knock yourself out.

//Shuffling is heard in the background, camera pans over a metal floor which is covered by cables, it is then positioned closely against the observation window pane//

**Researcher Pauling:** Wait a sec.

//Lights switch on, illuminating a rock wall, on several small outcroppings are rooted plant-like organisms that superficially resemble extinct Charniodiscus, crawling between them and vertically clinging to walls are pale specimens superficially resembling extinct Spriggina. Notably, both specimens are substantially larger than any fossils of the aforementioned organisms.//

**Researcher Pauling:** To the people who are watching this up on the surface, are you also seeing this, or am I just dreaming?

//As the submersible continues descent, a specimen of Spriggina-like organisms is seen feeding on a specimen of the Charniodiscus-like organisms//

**Researcher Pauling:** What we&#39;re seeing is living, breathing, and eating pre-Cambrian, no, Ediacaran biota. These things are THE stem of nearly all modern plants and animals.

//On top of a larger rock shelf are situated several bag-like organisms superficially resembling extinct Pteridinum, appearing to expand and contract sequentially.//

**Researcher Pauling:** If not for the deadly pressure, I&#39;d perch myself up on that shelf and study them for a week, or more. This, this is a goldmine for biologists, paleobiologists, and zoologists.

**Technician Irwin:** As much as happy I am to see you gushing over... These things, we can&#39;t sacrifice too much electricity on those lights.

**Researcher Pauling:** That&#39;s why I&#39;m recording. So that I can bear it &#39;till next time we can turn them on.

**Technician Irwin:** Jeez dude, don&#39;t worry. We have enough to do a session like this every other day.

**Researcher Pauling:** My biologist heart bleeds for each minute I cannot look there.

//Lights outside flicker and then turn off, the rock wall is no longer visible.//

[BEGIN LOG]

**Researcher Pauling:** Shit, shit, you gotta get the camera here. Quick.

//The camera shakes wildly, however is only showing the metal floor of the submersible.//

**Technician Irwin:** Yeah, yeah, give me a moment, I&#39;m working on it.

//The camera footage becomes blurred.//

**Technician Irwin:** No, wait, wrong button.

**Researcher Pauling:** You&#39;re the tech guy, what are you doing.

**Technician Irwin:** Hold on, here, adjusted it to low light conditions.

//Footage becomes clear again. The camera is then brought towards the observation window. Outside of the submersible is visible a large worm-like organism. The organism is partially anchored within the wall of the cave and continues to extend out of it. The organism is covered in semi-gelatinous plates which are connected with soft, hanging, milky-white connective tissue, from underneath the plates are visible bunches of red setae.//

**Technician Irwin:** Do the honors Pauling, because I have no idea what I&#39;m looking at.

**Researcher Pauling:** I&#39;m gonna be honest, I don&#39;t know, and I&#39;m not sure if I should be elated or horrified.

//The organism bends upwards, exposing its anterior, which is wholly covered in further connective tissue and a large array of eyes. Each eye is estimated at 50 centimeters in diameter and emits a faint green light.//

**Technician Irwin:** Is it... looking at us?

//The organism bends downwards and hangs over wall of SCP-7541. A large amount of previously resting Trilobozoa-like organisms escape via high speed rotation of whole organism. The wall is subsequently lit by a large amount of beams of green light which move seemingly at random intervals and directions, each beam leaves a trail of molten rock in its path. Several organisms hit by said beams begin to writhe in pain.//

**Researcher Pauling:** N-no, I suspect what its doing now would be considered looking.

//The organism clamps down onto the wall and begins to move downwards at a rapid velocity while extending itself continually. After approximately thirty (30) minutes, its movement reverses and velocity increases, the rock wall is visibly straining. During this time, several seismic shocks are registered by Outpost M.01. After ten (10) minutes, the organism disappears into the hole in the wall which it had previously made.//

**Technician Irwin:** Holy-.

//The footage shows Sr. Technician Walker seated against the wall of the submersible.//

**Sr. Technician Walker:** Right, so we made it to about 18 kilometers deep, and there&#39;s a big problem.

//The camera pans towards the observation window, which is obscured by thick red hairs and covered with a clear and viscous liquid.//

**Sr. Technician Walker:** We&#39;ve gone and asked if we should continue the mission, asked Alexis back in M.01 to get it to SCPS Charybdis and outwards, but, we only got told that no signal is coming through after the guys on the ship tried to send it forwards.

**Researcher Pauling:** They are are excreting something. I am guessing it&#39;s biological waste of whatever spewed these hairs out. We&#39;re essentially being shat on.

**Sr. Technician Walker:** Any idea what it is?

**Researcher Pauling:** No clue chief, it&#39;s big and eats a lot, all I can say. Maybe it&#39;s related to that thing we saw a few days ago, but that&#39;s it.

**Technician Irwin:** Yeah, we got a bigger problem than being enveloped in hair. See these marks?

//Technician Irwin points towards several white spots on the glass.//

**Technician Irwin:** That&#39;s corrosion. That waste is highly corrosive. Whatever its eating, it sure is toxic.

**Researcher Pauling:** Should we be worried?

**Sr. Technician Walker:** We have no idea if there&#39;s extensive damage. I suppose one of us could exit the craft in the pressure suit to make sure, since that&#39;s the only way to check. I&#39;d be pretty worried what the thing outside would do to them though.

**Researcher Pauling:** What are we supposed to do then?

**Sr. Technician Walker:** Unless the, er, whatever that is can be scared off by lights, we&#39;re sitting ducks. This craft is built only for being submerged and looking out of it, it&#39;s old stock that we&#39;ve been operating on since the 80&#39;s.

//Suddenly, the red hairs simultaneously retreat downwards, the entire submersible begins shaking violently. The camera falls over and for several seconds shows only the feet of the crew and cables strewn across the floor. The camera is picked up once the submersible stops shaking and is once again showing the observation window. Said window is now partially covered in the aforementioned liquid, rendering a portion of it useless to observation. Out of the uncovered portion is visible the wall of SCP-7541 which is now covered in a writhing vein-like structure. Several free-floating bubbles of the substance are visible, within one of which is caught a slowly dissolving organism.//

**Researcher Pauling:** Ouch, poor bugger.

//Out of the depth emerge two tentacle like structures, which using long hairs begin probing the bubble with the dissolving organism. After several minutes of said activity, a keratinous hook shoots out of the depth and drags the bubble with the organism downwards. The submersible shakes again for a second before a loud thud is hears.//

**Researcher Pauling:** N-no, I don&#39;t want to.

//An audible thud is heard.//

**Technician Irwin:** Right, you heard it? We did too. We got an indent after a couple of rounds of those. Walker, he volunteered to check it out, and make sure structural integrity isn&#39;t compromised, we had one of those high-pressure suits here.

//An audible thud is heard.//

**Technician Irwin:** We also asked him to clean up the liquid from the window, more and more of it seemed to appear. So he dives out and...

//Researcher Pauling sobs, and an audible thud is heard.//

**Technician Irwin:** Pauling held the rope when it snapped, we don&#39;t know if he... We can&#39;t see any shapes through the window, but if we turn on the lights we can see some colors.

//An audible thud is heard.//

**Technician Irwin:** There was a lot of red.

//An audible thud is heard.//

**Technician Irwin:** And these thuds are happening more and more.

++ Personal File of: Ensign Hal Brookes.

Today is 25th of June. Outpost is getting irritated too at the lack of supplies. I didn&#39;t ask if they also see the escaping air. I spent the morning looking at the water, I did not imagine it, there is a light flashing down there, strong enough to visible in daylight, I do not know how, or why, I don&#39;t want to look at the water again.
**Are you certain you want to edit this file?**
[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop show=+ Yes|hide=- Yes]]
**Saved!**
Today is... I don&#39;t know. I haven&#39;t seen sunlight in so long. I am writing this as, I don&#39;t know, I think as a warning, reminder, to whom? I don&#39;t know if anyone will find this file, or this computer, or if anyone is even searching for me. I don&#39;t want anyone to find me.

I am currently trapped within a pocket of air aboard the former SCPS Charybdis. By some miracle, my  terminal is still here, still untouched, and I will suffocate by it once the time comes. That fate will be a hundred times better than what my crewmates had gone through.

We were lifted up into the air by it. Not by its will, but by its sheer mass. This sea of antediluvian flesh, so long deep underground that all color was sucked out of it, and so old that it was neither a solid nor a liquid, and with this mass, it replaced the sea, the ocean. It simply pushed it aside, and then it kept coming, and coming. The Trench was as if an infection, spilling pus onto the surface.

The boils on its surface burst, they burst with the force of an aerial bomb, they blasted all around us, and from them came pouring a gas, orange, hot to touch, and burning the lungs, only some of us managed to get gas masks on, those who did not keeled over, and simply died, or jumped over the railing. Before I managed to get my mask on, I felt it too, and I for but a moment, wanted to jump over board onto it.

I went onto the deck and could still see the sea from where we were, and once this orange reached it, fish came to the surface, as far as you could see, constantly upwards, on their backs, and then the birds, which came for the fish, they fell from the sky. Then the ocean began to be dragged into it as it poured out and with it the fish and the birds, and they kept coming.

I wanted to cover my eyes there, everyone on board I think did. I was not a religious man, the Foundation leaves scant few places to preserve what belief you had, I am now, for what I watched was unholy in some regard. 

One of us, a mate first class, jumped overboard, onto the fleshy wetness our craft rested on, and began running, but as he ran, he was coated with the substance of it, and slowly but surely, his skin and flesh melted and sloughed off. The legs on which he ran became shorter and shorter until he simply fell over, and in a second he was gone, sunken into it.

Someone fired off a depth charge, naturally it did not even arm but a low, deep rumble came, I felt it in my bones, in my teeth, in my skin, as if it was threatening to rip it off just with that. At that point, we all could hear warnings from other terminals, someone screamed that part of the Atlantic simply collapsed into the ground, by the space left by this thing pouring out, and it kept pouring.

Then we seen as a tentacle skid on it, tentacle as big as sequoia, for us. I was frozen in place, holding onto a railing, the metal chains bit into my hand. And then the tentacles stopped just before us, and bent over, and a hundred thousand beams of green light shone up on us. Ten were on me, I know, for I still pain from them, and I see the scars they left on me, ten trails on my skin.

But that part was not the worst, I do not know from where, I do not want to know, but I felt a sting, and then I could see it, in its entirety. It wrapped the core, it was the mantle, it is Atlas that moves the plates, and it was the seed that came to Earth in the Hadean.

I writhed in pain on the floor, as did my comrades, those still inside ran out, as if compelled. Only I managed to overcome the pain.

I ran for the door to this cabin. And behind me it slammed onto the deck, and took everyone but me. 

I felt it move back, back towards the dark from which we spurred it. And then it threw the boat and me with it, a breadcrumb after a feast.

I wish I could erase all of these images from my mind, but I find myself repeating them, in action, in mind. I wish I could stop. I can&#39;t. 

There&#39;s a thought that kept ringing out after it ended. It came up before, and so it will come again.
