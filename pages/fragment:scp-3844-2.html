**Item #:** SCP-3844

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** While proper facilities are under construction, SCP-3844 is to be contained at its dwelling within the Dolomite Mountains. A 100m x 100m perimeter is to be regularly patrolled by Foundation personnel to ensure no civilians come into contact with SCP-3844. 

Anti-aircraft artillery is to be positioned around SCP-3844&#39;s dwelling. Artillery is to fire at any airborne entities over the containment perimeter. Any evidence of the existence of SCP-3844 is to be attributed to bombing runs. 

Once a week, one D-Class is to be sent to interact with SCP-3844. Stealing items from SCP-3844 is prohibited.

**Description:** SCP-3844 is a winged reptile, measuring 73.76m from tail to head with a wing span of 67.42m. It is estimated to mass 27,000kg. SCP-3844&#39;s scales are of a purple hue, except around the stomach where they are much lighter. SCP-3844 is capable of expelling fire at 3400°C from its mouth through an unknown method.

SCP-3844 is capable of speech in at least 14 languages, and has an extensive knowledge of world events. During interactions with personnel, SCP-3844 takes on the form of an adult male human, however SCP-3844 can mimic the appearance of any human. 

SCP-3844 inhabits a cavern that contains a currently unquantified amount of valuable metals. SCP-3844 often burrows underneath these materials, where it presumably sleeps. 

**Addendum:** The following is a transcript of an interview between Dr. Lester Fegmont and SCP-3844.

&gt; &lt;**Begin Log**&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Fegmont:** Good evening. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3844:** Lester! It&#39;s been decades, I believe. Although I guess you never specified a time for your return visit. Or circumstances.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fegmont:** I&#39;m sorry about the err... updates, but war time calls for extreme measures.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3844:** Ah, so the new-age knights still fight old-time battles. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Fegmont:** I wouldn&#39;t say that we fight really. We just make sure the battles don&#39;t expose things people aren&#39;t supposed to see.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3844:** Like me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Fegmont:** Yes, like you. But trust me, there are much, much worse things. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3844:** I see. Did you at least bring the gin this time?
&gt; 
&gt; **Fegmont:** //[smiles]// I might run the show around here, but I still can&#39;t drink on the job.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3844:** //[laughs]// Next time, then.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fegmont:** Of course. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3844:** And will I ever be allowed to fly again?
&gt; 
&gt; **Fegmont:** Hopefully. But not before the war ends. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3844:** The war is your whole world, isn&#39;t it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Fegmont:** Not so much. Governments just pay us to keep anomalies out of the hands of the other side. Can&#39;t imagine what would happen if people got ahold of anomalous rifles or—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3844:** Dragons. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Fegmont:** Yes, dragons. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3844:** Do you still perform research like you used to? I remember how you spoke of the lab.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fegmont:** We do. We do. One day, this war will end, but others of uh... your type show no signs of slowing down. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3844:** Sharpening your swords. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Fegmont:** I guess that&#39;s the apt analogy. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3844:** And your fellow men eye me the same way knights did too. Like a prize.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fegmont:** They&#39;re just taking the measurements I should&#39;ve made when we first met. I&#39;ll come back when we discover new things to evaluate.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3844:** And at the end of the war, right?
&gt; 
&gt; **Fegmont:** And at the end of the war. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3844:** I do hope I can trust you to uphold that. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Fegmont:** Of course you can. But until then, do you have any further questions? I believe all of mine have been answered.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3844:** Don&#39;t worry about me when there are larger issues at hand. You have a war to fight after all.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;**End Log**&gt;
