&gt; **Foreword:** This page is to document anomalous events that have attracted the Foundation&#39;s interests, but occurred too briefly for the Foundation to secure or contain them. Instead, the Foundation deploys a cover-up team to conceal the evidence from the public. This is merely a reminder to agents and researchers that not all of them can be contained.
&gt; -Agent Carriontrooper

Due to the increasing number of items discovered by the Foundation, this list is no longer open to new entries. A [[[log-of-extranormal-events-vol-ii| second volume]]] of this log has been made available, and currently remains open to new additions.

Lists of [[[log-of-anomalous-items| Anomalous Items]]] and [[[log-of-unexplained-locations| Unexplained Locations]]] have also been compiled.

//**Note:** Please add new entries to the bottom of the list, not the middle or the top.//

**Event Description:** A sperm whale estimated to be 2 km in length was observed breaching the ocean&#39;s surface, causing three nearby boats to capsize upon re-entry. 
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Puget Sound, Washington, U.S.A
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Foundation removed any details about the anomalous nature of the creature from local news sources. Witnesses on ferries and close enough beaches administered Class A amnestics.

**Event Description:** A glowing humanoid figure manifested on a subway platform and was seen by several eyewitnesses and captured on the station&#39;s surveillance system. The humanoid approached the edge of the tracks while making vague hand gestures and promptly vanished. 
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Barcelona, Spain.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** A team of disguised agents and a portable holographic projection unit were brought to the location. The team explained that the incident was a part of their avant-garde &#39;urban shock art&#39; exhibition all over Europe. Fake viral media planted to give credence to the team&#39;s supposed art group.

**Event Description:** Time skips between 2.5 and 26 hours took place in Concord, North Carolina before normalizing to one day after initial skip. Non self-correcting electronic devices such as digital clocks were seemingly unaffected and displayed incorrect times in different areas of the town. Event bears similarity to a relatively unnoticed event in Carson City, Nevada, though no connection could be traced between the two events.
**Date of Occurrence:** █/██/████
**Location:** Concord, North Carolina, USA
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Local news reported electromagnetic interference caused by a local power plant. Small observation team assigned to area.

**Event Description:** The entire population of Holyhead, Wales was found comatose in a field just outside of town. All individuals were unharmed, but possessed slight burns on their clothing. All individuals woke up 14 hours later with no recollection of the event. 
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Holyhead, Wales.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Population dosed with Class-B amnestics. A road accident involving a Samson-Craig Products (an SCP front company) chemical tanker was staged as a cover story. An emergency evacuation camp was arranged and the population were given £150 per head as compensation. Since the event there has been no recurrence or abnormal behavior in the population.

**Event Description:** Three similar looking men were witnessed fighting in a gas station parking lot. Eyewitness reports maintain that each man claimed to be ██████ █████████, a well-known local car salesman, and were fighting over which individual was the &#34;true&#34; one. Two of the men were killed when the third procured a crowbar. The third was fatally shot by a local police officer.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Friendship, Oklahoma.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Witnesses and involved persons were questioned and given Class B amnestics. Close family members of ██████ █████████ were questioned and given Class-A amnestics. A cover story involving the individual&#39;s suicide was established. The three bodies were recovered for autopsy and are currently maintained in a Site-19 minimum security storage freezer.

**Event Description:** Several students attending ████████ Collegiate began complaining about a loud buzzing noise. A custodian for the school located the source as a single monitor in the computer lab during his duties, and reported the power button was unresponsive. When the lab technicians arrived the next day, they unplugged the monitor after other attempts proved futile. Witnesses of the event report a scream playing through the computer&#39;s speakers, and the image of a digitized face screaming appeared for a moment before power was lost.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ████████ Collegiate in Sandwich, New Hampshire, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The monitor was confiscated for inspection. Nothing of interest has been found.

**Event Description:** During an automobile accident, the body of ████ ██, a passenger in one involved vehicle, expanded to fill the entire interior of the vehicle. Because Mr. ██&#39;s expanded body had taken on a consistency similar to stiff foam rubber, the other occupants of the vehicle were protected from the impact, and were the only survivors of the crash.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Seymour, Connecticut.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Body confiscated, all other occupants and responding personnel administered Class A amnestics. Tissue tests indicate that Mr. ██ is still alive, though the tissues of his body have become an undifferentiated mass, and tests of neurological function are inconclusive.

**Event Description:** Unidentified and unaccompanied child (estimated age: 7 years old) in a hospital waiting room produces more than 400 kilograms of vomit in 5 minutes, before dying; other patients describe hearing sounds of &#34;glass breaking&#34; during the emesis.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Andranomadio Public Hospital, Antsirabe, Madagascar.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Majority of vomit had been incinerated before Foundation agents arrived on-site; inspection of hospital incinerator revealed no anomalies. All remaining samples of vomit were confiscated; analysis revealed no anomalies, except that child had been suffering from salmonella poisoning. Witnesses were given amnestics. Child was never identified; body was removed from hospital morgue and is currently maintained in a Site-19 low-value storage freezer.

**Event Description:** An email is sent to, as near as the Foundation can determine, every active email address in existence, including Foundation intranet-only addresses. The contents are identical across all emails and consist of the following message, in Spanish: &#34;Hi, this is Jorge. It has been fun playing with you, but I am going to visit friends next door now. I will be back later to collect my toys. Take care of the place!&#34; Backtracking reveals that all emails originated from the same unassigned IP address.
**Date of Occurrence:** 12/21/████
**Location:** Worldwide
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Foundation agents edited the internet-rumor-debunking site ██████.com to include a statement that the email was a massive hoax. The Foundation has periodically mass-emailed similar messages to more limited audiences as a smokescreen. The originating IP address is being monitored for any further activity.

**Event Description:** A suspected associate of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. was observed entering an abandoned factory by Foundation operatives. The sound of bubbling water was heard from within the factory prior to two gunshots. Operatives found the suspect&#39;s body in a state of advanced decomposition associated with at least three weeks of exposure. A pistol, which had been fired three times, was found within the subject&#39;s jacket. No signs of the suspect&#39;s assailant were found.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/15/████
**Location:** ███ ██████, Salvador, State of Bahia, Brazil.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Information suppressed in local media. Body removed from site by Foundation operatives disguised as Brazilian Federal Police and interred at morgue at Site-60.

**Event Description:** Six sperm whale carcasses were found beached along a 2 km stretch of coastline at ████████, New Zealand. When autopsy was performed as part of a civilian research program, it was discovered that the chest cavity of all six whales had been hollowed out postmortem without any damage being done to the exterior of the animals. Exploration of the interior carcass revealed the chest cavity of each whale had somehow been stuffed with machinery components trapped in clear plastic.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/18/████
**Location:** Akaroa, New Zealand.
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Area sealed. All members of the research team detained and administered Class-A amnestics. False story disseminated claiming that the decomposition of the whales&#39; bodies had led to the build-up of toxic gas inside the carcasses, leading to government intervention on grounds of public health. Masses found inside body cavities removed and shipped to Storage Site-108. Remains incinerated in the field and disposed of through normal channels.

**Event Description:** The ██████ ██████ flight between Heathrow, London and Hartsfield-Jackson, Atlanta suffered a malfunction and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, 800 km from the Azores archipelago. Despite this, all passengers and crew walked out the destination gate, remembering only a regular flight.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/11/████
**Location:** North Atlantic Ocean.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Information suppressed and mass amnestic treatment performed, recovery of aircraft underway.

**Event Description:** Every domesticated cat inside the city limits of ██████, Norway traveled 10.9 km SE to ██████████████, Sweden over period of 8 hours. Cats congregated in groupings of 13-25 in a field behind [DATA EXPUNGED] for 2 hours, then dispersed.
**Date of Occurrence:** 25/09/2009
**Location:** Norway/Sweden border.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Cats returned of their own accord to their homes. Any footage of gathering confiscated for study. Witnesses processed, debriefed, and administered Class-B amnestic. Field searched for abnormalities, blood and urine samples taken from cats in affected areas. No anomalies found. Both ██████ and the field will be under surveillance until 30/09/2014.

**Event Description:** During a speech to a public committee, the mayor of Bonifay, FL began continuously chuckling at a pun made by a legislative observer for approximately 4.5 hours straight before collapsing into a nearby chair and passing out. He claims to have no memory of the event, nor did anyone else in the room during the speech. The only available evidence of its occurrence was captured entirely on camera.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/19██
**Location:** Bonifay, Florida, USA
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Any and all witnesses who videotaped the event, along with anyone who viewed the videotapes themselves were given Class-B amnestics, and all resulting videotapes were wiped clean. The mayor himself is under minor surveillance from select members of the Foundation.

**Event Description**: At exactly 2pm, 24 instances of a semi-erotic calendar appeared in numerous Foundation sites. Inside the calendar, images of Dr. Elliot, Dr. Kiryu, Dr. ████, Agent Merlo, Director ██████, Dr. Right, Agent █████, Researcher █████, Agent ████, Dr. Marie, Dr. ████, and Dr. Jack Bright. The Calendar displayed the name Double D-class, and despite the statements of personnel included in the calendar, shows signs of being planned and professionally made.
**Date of Occurrence**: ██/01/14
**Location**: Sites-5, 29, 82, 11, and 6
**Follow-up Actions Taken**: Most instances were recovered by Foundation staff, several copies have been confiscated from staff since the incident.
**Note:** Dr. Jack Bright was not inhabiting a female body at the time, indicating that either a prop was used or this is a mistake by the creator.

**Event Description**: After Long Island citizen ███████ ██████ died of alcohol-damage related illness, a recliner chair in his home began ascending at speeds of exactly 3.6m/s before eventually accelerating to 16.3m/s. Attempts at stopping the ascent were futile, and the chair broke through any barriers placed in its way. It has since then left the atmosphere and is believed to be orbiting Jupiter.
**Date of Occurrence**: 2/15/201█
**Location**: Muttontown, New York.
**Follow-up Actions Taken**: Any footage of the incident was wiped and pulled off the internet. Class-A amnestics were given to witnesses. Foundation operatives in various space programs are advised to destroy any information of the chair if found.

**Event Description:** Eighty-eight thousand, eight hundred and eighty-eight citizens of the state of New Jersey fractured their left scaphoid bones within a two-hour period; radiography showed that all fractures were identical down to a sub-millimeter level.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Various hospitals throughout New Jersey.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-A amnestics administered to radiography technicians.

**Event Description:** Viewers of the popular late-night talk show ████ █████ ██ ███ █████ reported seeing two different episodes. Approximately 40% watched an episode featuring the famous actor █████ ███ and the musical guest ██ ██████, while the other 60% watched an episode with ██ ██████ with an appearance by stand-up comedian ████ ██. Neither one of these episodes was the one which had actually broadcast, and neither one has ever been filmed.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Various televisions throughout the USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All recordings of the anomalous episodes showed the actual broadcast episode in later viewings. Viewer&#39;s memories of the anomalous episodes seem to have completely faded by themselves by ██/██/████. ███ channel officials who had been contacted about the episodes were administered Class-C amnestics and their internal investigation into the matter aborted. Social networks mentioning the matter were intercepted and edited.

**Event Description:** A parrot owned by the █████ family was discovered to have the ability to sing the entirety of the song &#34;Crazy Train&#34; by John Michael &#34;Ozzy&#34; Osbourne, including vocals, guitar, bass, drums, and keyboard. No member of the family ever recalls the parrot hearing it.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Greenwich, Connecticut, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-A amnestics distributed to the █████ family; parrot seized and ensconced in the Site-19 Anomalous Wildlife Habitat.

**Event Description:** For approximately 12 minutes, all shed human blood within a 15 km radius of ██████, France spontaneously turned into centipedes. All centipedes in the area turned back into blood following the cessation of the event.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Cherbourg, France.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Aerosolized amnestics were deployed over the town. Additional amnestics were distributed to women on menstrual periods during the event, due to extreme emotional distress rendering the aerosolized version ineffective.

**Event Description:** All written text in the Theater Department at ██████-██ University spontaneously converted to Wingdings. Digital text remained unaffected until printed out. All affected text contained the phrase &#34;You don&#39;t need a script to pretend to be someone else, you&#39;re doing it right now! ( ・ω・)&#34;
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/2014
**Location:** Staten Island, New York.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-A amnestics were administered to all students and faculty present. Affected books were incinerated, and are currently being replaced.

**Event Description:** A translucent digital clock approximately 3 km across appeared in the sky about 1.5 km above the ground. The anomaly counted down from 05:55, stopping short of 01:13 before disappearing completely.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/2006
**Location:** Devon Island, Nunavut, Canada.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Anomaly was only witnessed by a single fishing trawler. Class-C amnestics issued to the entire crew.

**Event Description:** A single specimen of //Dionaea muscipula//, better known as the Venus flytrap, expanded to approximately 2.5m tall and consumed a domesticated cat. The specimen expired shortly after and was reported by passing civilians.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-A amnestics issued to witnesses. Specimen taken for future studying.

**Event Description:** Ten minutes before opening to the general public, three visit team staff and a security officer at ██████ Museum witnessed a //Scutigera coleoptrata// specimen, commonly known as a house centipede, emerge from a small drainage pipe in a storage closet. The specimen traveled approximately 1 m before entering a sink u-bend which had been opened for repairs. Specimen was estimated to be over 12 m in length, though of average width and height for its species. Specimen was visible for several minutes after the head portion had entered the u-bend, while the remainder of its body continued to exit the drainage pipe.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Burnsville, Minnesota.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-A amnestics administered to museum personnel. Facility plumbing was fully examined by Foundation personnel, and specimen could not be located. Presumed to have escaped into city sewer network. Communications watch placed on ████ Public Works to monitor for future reports.

**Event Description:** The Cincinnati metropolitan area and all objects and lifeforms in it became greyscale for approximately 77 hours, starting at approximately 10:00 AM. All humans in the metropolitan area when the change occurred were not aware of the existence of color while the effect persisted. Those who entered the area of effect after the change occurred were not affected, but affected individuals treated them with fear and suspicion. When the change was reverted through unknown means, all individuals within the affected area lost their memories of the event, although those who had left the area of effect before the restoration of color retained their memories.
**Date of Occurrence:** 3/21/2014 through 3/23/2014
**Location:** Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class A amnestics administered to individuals who retained memories of the event, and all records of the event destroyed.

**Event Description:** All weights within the ██████&amp;Son Gym assumed a red coloration for a period of five hours. All the affected weights possessed a white sticker reporting the words &#34;**Tired of the old, boring, black weights? (T_T) ██-██ ##red|Try the red ones! (*A*) ██-██##**&#34;.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2014/██/██
**Location:** Birmingham, England, UK.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-B amnestics were administered to all witnesses. All weights were taken in custody for further studying. Following the event, the objects displayed no apparent anomalous effect. However, closer inspections revealed that the words &#34;Brought to you by the Kobayashi Athletics&#34; were inscribed on the items. All weights were replaced by new ones. The establishment is to be kept under surveillance until 2016/██/██.

**Event Description:** Two individuals were observed to spend seven hours attempting to move past each other in a narrow hallway before one collapsed from exhaustion, at which point the other decided to take a different route. There is no indication, either from recorded footage of the event or from the testimony of the involved parties, that this was intentional or involuntary.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2014/██/██
**Location:** Boston, Massachusetts office of ██████████, USA.
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Affected subjects were provided with appropriate medical care and amnestics were administered to all known witnesses. The hallway in question and the affected subjects have shown no anomalous properties before or since.

**Event Description:** During a public concert in the town of ██████, Georgia, a large number of //Procyon lotor// (common raccoon) assembled behind the outdoor concert stage, and started constructing an object resembling a shrine out of materials they had collected from various places around the town, including branches, pine cones, fast-food wrappers, old newspaper, and a trash-can lid. After the shrine was constructed, the raccoons proceeded to make motions described by onlookers as &#34;bowing&#34; to the shrine, and then quickly scattered. Upon attempted destruction of the shrine by civilian Joseph ███████, a large and aggressive nursery of raccoons emerged, numbering more than 100 by most witness accounts. The nursery proceeded to assault Joseph ███████, resulting in his death.
**Date of Occurrence:** █/██/20██
**Location:** Brookhaven, Georgia, USA
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All those who witnessed the event were given Class-A amnestics. Death of Joseph ███████ covered up with a report of a violent mugging. Concert zone acquired by Foundation under the cover of construction. Shrine destroyed by small explosives from a safe distance under the same cover of construction. Observational post disguised as a bird sanctuary constructed. No other anomalous occurrences to date.

**Event Description:** All moths in a 5 kilometer radius of a single porch light made their way towards the light and gathered there for an hour. The moths then dispersed into the surrounding area.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Sandwich, New Hampshire, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** No special actions, due to lack of witnesses at time of event. The area is to be observed for more anomalous activity until 1/1/████.

**Event Description:** A large, ten-centimeter thick layer of snow suddenly fell over the town of ██████, Massachusetts and coated the entire area. No clouds were visible at the time and despite sudden shifts in supported weight no buildings or structures were damaged.
**Date of Occurrence:** █/██/1999
**Location:** Fall River, Massachusetts, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** A sample of the snow was obtained; it was found to be mundane. All residents of the town administered Class-A amnestics. As the event occurred quickly, very little video footage was captured. However, all documentation of the event has been destroyed.

**Event Description:** For a period of approximately five hours, ██████ residents of Pompano Beach, Florida and ████ non-residents working in the city, including ██ Foundation employees, experienced a shared hallucination. Interviews with those affected have provided a detailed, highly consistent account of the entire city being transported to the surface of a planet (believed to be Venus), protected by a dome of unknown design. (See Document E-41567-██ for full account.) However, telephone records, security camera feeds and interviews with non-resident non-employees suggest that nothing unusual happened during the time period and that all those affected were present on Earth and went about their business as normal.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/2011
**Location:** Pompano Beach, Florida, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Affected individuals provided with amnestics after interview. Foundation personnel involved in the event have been commended for controlling media coverage. Amnestic treatment has successfully removed memories of the event. Implementation of further surveillance is currently under debate.

**Event Description:** Towards the end of a show, musician █████████████ began sweating profusely. For 6 minutes, the sweat fell to the floor and pooled together, forming into various miniature trains. Following this, the trains rapidly evaporated.
**Date of Occurrence:** 05/22/2015
**Location:** Earth, Texas, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Witnesses (including the musician) were administered Class-A amnestics. No further action was required, and the show was generally well received.

**Event Description:** Over an eight-minute period, six hundred and ninety-seven lightning strikes occurred within a twenty-mile wide radius around Faeto, Italy. Meteorological data shows that the locations of these strikes formed a &#34;smiley.&#34; At the same time, all drinking water within the settlement was, according to anecdotal evidence, icy cold, scented of strawberries, and could not be boiled or otherwise heated.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2015/07/01

**Event Description:** Commencing at 07:31, all instances of the Basenji breed of //Canis lupus familiaris// barked constantly for one minute and forty three seconds. Commencement/cessation of barking was not linked to any external stimuli.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2015/07/03
**Location:** Australia.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Fallopia, Agent [REDACTED]&#39;s Basenji, taken for post-anomaly testing. No anomalous activity noted since.

**Event Description:** At approximately █:26 AM local time, a train bound from █████████ to █████ (hereafter Train-A) collided with an identical train moving along the same line from █████ to █████████ (hereafter Train-B). Of the 56 casualties observed, only 28 civilians were identified. Each civilian was identified twice, with one instance riding Train-A and the other instance riding Train-B. Examination shows that all electronic and time-keeping devices present on Train-B at the time of collision were 9 hours slow. All passengers are confirmed to have been traveling on the route of Train-B 9 hours before the event, though without incident. Temporal interference has been suggested, though the cause is currently unknown and the logical paradox the situation represents has been deemed unsolvable. Whether all civilians involved caught the same train as one another twice consecutively as the result of coincidence or the effect of causal manipulation is unknown. No passengers of either train survived the impact.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/2015
**Location:** ███████████ train line, Victoria, Australia.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All Train-B passengers were removed from the scene and taken into Foundation custody, currently kept in Site-██ cold storage. The ███████████ train line has been put under observation for further extranormal activity over a 6 month period, which is yet uneventful.

At the 3-minute mark, all calls vanished completely from the queue.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** █████, ██████ ████, Philippines, calls were documented to come from the employee&#39;s address in ████, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Call records for the time frame when the calls occurred were expunged from the system and false records inputted during a routine system maintenance the next day. Class-B amnestics were administered to all parties involved while the employee was monitored for the next 3 months but no anomalous activity was noted.

**Event Description:** At roughly 2:30 PM, sixteen (16) city buses pulled up to a movie theater owned by a private company; all buses were packed full. All people aboard the buses (bus drivers included) as well as the owner of the movie theater shared the same first name: &#34;Greg&#34;.

There was no convention of any sorts occurring at the time in the town, nor any in the world at that time that was summoning people with the name &#34;Greg&#34;.
**Date of Occurrence:** 3/17/199█
**Location:** Greg&#39;s Theater, Unity, Pennsylvania, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Interviews with all 1267 Gregs&#39; involved as well as their families found that this had not been a planned event, and that 97% of all people involved did not know anyone else that had attended prior to the event. No records indicate that there were any advertisements or events that would have sparked such an occurrence. All Gregs&#39; and witnesses involved were given Class-A amnestics. A cover-up story involving a Greg convention was released, and no further incident occurred after cover-up was released. Theater was monitored for two years, but aside from a reduced crime rate for the first two weeks after the event no anomalous activity occurred.

**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Given the time of day and number of potential witnesses, amnestic treatment was not recommended for all but affected individuals. Interviews with affected individuals revealed causes ranging from allergies to infections to sunlight as the source of sneezing. No link between individuals was obtained; most considered the event an amusing coincidence. MTF-Rho-13 (&#34;YouTube Celebs&#34;) deployed an online cover-up story claiming the event was an out-of-season test run for a flash mob.

**Event Description:** Forty-nine fresh human corpses appeared in the master bedroom of a home undergoing construction, during the 30 second duration between the installation of a door in the doorframe, and the opening of the door for the first time. All corpses were of the same individual (identified as former United States Senator Joseph McCarthy, 1908-1957) at different ages, ranging from an estimated 48 years old to a newborn with umbilical cord still attached.

**Date of Occurrence:** 2015-07-18
**Location:** Fairford, Gloucestershire, England.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** A cover story of a house fire was blamed for the fatality; all witnesses were administered Class-A amnestics.

**Event Description:** All photographs, both digital and physical, were altered to include an image of Bahamian-American actor Sidney Poitier at various stages of his life and participating in the actions depicted in the photographs.  Poitier&#39;s age corresponded with the age of the youngest depicted person in the photograph.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2016-02-20
**Location:** Site-17, [REDACTED].
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All photographs were confiscated and replaced with altered versions or versions that had been off site during the event.  Digital backups of the originals are stored on the Site-17 archives.

**Event Description:** Forty-three humanoid individuals, each one resembling a United States president, poured out of a supply closet in the Joint Security Area of the Korean Demilitarized Zone. All individuals remained silent until they all gathered in the MAC Conference Building, where they stood in an unorganized cluster while loudly repeating the phrase &#34;blah blah blah&#34;, all out of sync with one another. These individuals went unnoticed by the guards in the area for seventeen (17) minutes before one guard in the room suddenly screamed and proceeded to open fire on the group in a panic, killing approximately seven (7) of them and sending the rest scattering, none of which bled from their wounds. Other guards rushed into the room, but seemed to take no notice of the anomalous humanoids, instead choosing to restrain the panicked guard. The escaped humanoids all ran back into the same supply closet from which they had previously appeared.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/2017
**Location:** Demilitarized Zone, Korea.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Amnestics administered to all guards involved. Security footage removed with edited versions replaced. Supply closet was found to have no anomalous properties. Corpses of &#34;presidents&#34; removed for study. Autopsies revealed all individuals were biologically human, but were completely lacking blood. DNA failed to match with any others on record, including those of the presidents they resembled (Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump).

Members of the Unusual Incidents Unit headquartered within the building were instructed to monitor the building for further anomalies for a five-year period.

**Event Description:** A family of three created a rudimentary religion after several cereal boxes developed human legs and arms, with the religion centered around the worship of these cereals. The family developed false names for these cereals based on their contents, such as //Narroct, Lord of the Beehive// (Honey-Nut Cheerios), //The Pirate and the Sea// (Captain Crunch) and //The Twins of Rock, Coco and Fruity// (Cocoa Pebbles and Fruity Pebbles respectively). The family members had no recollection of the event when the limbs demanifested after three days. 
**Date of Occurrence:** 9/16/████ - 9/19/████
**Location:** Mountainair, New Mexico, USA.
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** All cereal items belonging to the family were confiscated, and Class A amnestics were administered. The cereals have been sent to Site-551 due to potential anomaly.

**Event Description:** Surveillance camera staff at the natural reserve near Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires City, Argentina, saw what appeared to be the same man in two different parts of the park at the same time, apparently mirroring each other&#39;s movements despite the lack of line of sight between the two. The individuals then disappeared into the brush. People in the reserve at that time talked about a weird man talking to himself about the &#39;████ing Paraguayans&#34; before walking off-road.
**Date of Occurrence:** 01/██/2018
**Location:** Natural reserve, Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, Argentine Republic.

**Event Description:** An intestinal tumor located in the body of Grover ███████, a 52-year-old man from Des Moines, Iowa, is found to contain an entire secondary brain, including medulla, pituitary gland, and  part of a spinal cord. DNA from the brain does not match that of Mr. ███████, and is currently believed to belong to a twelve year-old girl who vanished from Calgary, Alberta, Canada in 1992.
**Date of Occurrence:** 04/05/2010
**Location:** Des Moines, Iowa
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Doctors involved with the surgery amnesticized. Mr. ███████ died following the surgery. Despite several autopsies and examinations, no definitive cause of death has been determined. His cadaver, as well as the brain excised from his stomach, remain in cold storage.

**Event Description:** $237,981 manifested simultaneously, spread across various countries on flat surfaces at approximately $1.3 per square kilometer. This money changed to a different currency depending on the country it manifested within.
**Date of Occurrence:** 5/9/2014
**Location:**  Worldwide.
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** None, due to the very obscure nature of the event, and that 87% of all the manifested money was made unusable from external forces.

**Event Description:** The PA system in a Giant Eagle supermarket announced, &#34;Attention Giant Eagle shoppers: the ritual will now commence,&#34; whereupon all individuals within the store stopped what they were doing and hummed an intricate series of notes for approximately five minutes. After another tone, the humming ceased and all affected individuals resumed their business as though nothing had occurred.
**Date of Occurrence:** 10/10/2014
**Location:** Columbus, Ohio
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Event would not have come to Foundation attention if not for discovery of security footage during in-store theft investigation. Individuals affected during event have no memory thereof. As such, it has been determined that attempting to identify and interview each person visible on the tape is unfeasible. Videos confiscated, amnestics administered to store staff, and Foundation agents stationed at Giant Eagle supermarkets to monitor for future events or signs of PA system tampering.
**Update:** As of 27/04/2016, surveillance of Giant Eagle stores has produced no further evidence of anomalous activity. Agents recalled.

**Event Description:** Every human on earth simultaneously blinked. During the event ███ people disappeared.
**Date of Occurrence:** 3/5/18
**Location:** Earth.
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Various cover up stories to explain missing persons have been enacted. Blinking resulted in minor containment breaches at various sites relating to SCPs pertaining to sight.

**Event Description:** Between 16:00:04 UST and 19:53:02 UST, black hole Cygnus X-1 underwent a series of rapid fluctuations in registered x-ray flux density, up to 194.2% of the normal value. When converted into Morse Code, the fluctuations spelled out an expanded, 2018 updated version of the 1988 book //A Brief History of Time// by the recently deceased physicist Stephen William Hawking. Analysis shows the writing style of the updates to be consistent with that of the original author.
**Date of Occurrence:** 3/14/18
**Location:** Cygnus X-1
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Non-Foundation observers were administered Class-A amnestics, and the observation data in question was covered up. Cygnus X-1 is to be monitored for further anomalies. Whether to release the book under an appropriate cover story is currently under debate.

**Event Description:** All water in the Samur River was converted to human blood for four days. All water which entered the river at its source was converted into blood, and all blood which flowed out of the river was converted into water. Blood collected directly from the river did not change. 
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/2018-██/██/2018
**Location:** Samur River, Russia and Azerbaijan
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Amnestics were dispersed aerially through the nearby village of
Samurçay following completion of event. DNA analysis of collected blood compared against the Foundation genetic database identified all blood as originating from one Joshua Havaldar, a 34-year-old Indian-American man living in San Francisco. He was unable to provide information on the event, but did report exhibiting symptoms consistent with hypovolemia in the preceding week. Mr. Havaldar was administered Class-A Amnestics following interview. Both the Samur River and Mr. Havaldar are currently under a standard five-year monitoring period.

**Event Description:** A small canoe in the Mississippi River was consumed whole by a //Carcharocles megalodon//, along with its two occupants. //Carcharocles megalodon// has been extinct for 2.6 million years, and the river in question is much too shallow to contain a creature of that size.
**Date of Occurrence:** 02/14/2018
**Location:** Undisclosed location on the Mississippi River, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Amnestics were administered to witnesses, and a cover story was circulated claiming the canoe occupants were intoxicated and capsized their vessel accidentally. A task force was sent to locate and capture the anomalous entity, but all attempts to locate the specimen failed.

**Event Description:** Unscheduled subway train passes through 36th Street subway station in Brooklyn at approximately 80mph. Eye witnesses describe the train as purple with Arabic lettering on the side. Train wasn&#39;t reported appearing anywhere else.

**Location:** 36th Street, Brooklyn New York, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Witnesses administered Class-A amnestics, and footage of the event was confiscated.

**Event Description:** During a Toys R Us staff meeting, an employee later identified as William J. Horack stood, announced, &#34;Well, guess I won&#39;t need these anymore,&#34; and removed his lips with one hand. Afterward, he began to consume the remaining flesh around his mouth -- described by witnesses as having the appearance of &#34;pulled pork&#34; -- as the other employees returned to normal operations. Horack continued to autocannibalize over the course of the day, captured only intermittently by security cameras despite not leaving the meeting room. At 19:05, Horack had been reduced to skeletal remains, which then vanished. Eyewitnesses reported confusion that the event did not strike them at the time as being out of the ordinary.
**Date of Occurrence:** 15/03/2018
**Location:** Mayfield Heights, Ohio, USA
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Amnestics distributed to store employees and customers after interviews conducted. Investigation of security cameras revealed no fault. No personal information about William Horack could be attained, and all documentation involved in his three-year employment at Toys R Us appeared to be an intricate forgery. Lips retrieved from initial event location, determined to be faux lips made of wax.

**Event Description:** Over the course of five days, the entire student population of ██████ ██ Elementary School in Seven Hills, Ohio developed allergies to all nut-based food products.  Faculty and individuals not attending ██████ ██ Elementary who enter the building were unaffected. The symptoms ceased if individuals were removed from the premises for sixty-two hours. Notably, a student at the school, Isaac ██████, is currently comatose following a severe allergic reaction as a result of being force-fed a peanut butter sandwich.
**Date of Occurrence:** 02/19-02/23/2018
**Location:** Seven Hills, Ohio, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** School was shuttered, students were integrated into other elementary schools in the area. Isaac ██████&#39;s condition has shown no improvements. Foundation medical staff are currently attempting to treat and revive him in an attempt to find a link between his current state and the anomaly within  ██████ ██ Elementary.

**Event Description:** All canned food sold at Miller&#39;s Supermarket in Craig, Iowa was found to contain one or more live specimens of //Lampropeltis triangulum// (milk snake) in place of their intended contents. X-ray imaging shows that prior to opening, the cans contained their intended contents, and only upon opening do the snakes appear.
**Date of Occurrence:** 4/18/2017
**Location:** Craig, Iowa, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Anomaly ceased within twelve hours of its first manifestation. amnestics were administered to all affected, dispatch logs recording emergency calls of the event were scrubbed.  All milk snakes contained by the Foundation have yet to show anomalous properties.

**Date of Occurrence:** August 17th, 2017
**Location:** A submerged cave in Quintana Roo, Mexico.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Corpses moved to Site-17, all witnesses amnesticized.

**Event Description:** Twenty kakapo, representing approximately 24% of the extant members of the species, spontaneously combusted over the course of three minutes. Twenty kakapo chicks were found in the remains, genetically identical to the twenty deceased instances.
**Date of Occurrence:** 9/04/2018
**Location:** Codfish Island, New Zealand
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Amnestics administered to all witnesses, and a brood of mature cloned kakapo were released to account for the disparity. Genetic testing of the chicks found them to be a hybrid of a kakapo and an unidentified species of parrot.

**Event Description:** At least 1000 instances of plains zebra (Equus quagga) emerged from the opening of the volcanic cone of Shira, located on Mt. Kilimanjaro. Said instances descended Mt. Kilimanjaro and roamed the Kilimanjaro National Park for 2 hours before subsequently disappearing.
**Date of Occurrence:** 02/23/1988
**Location:** Kilimanjaro National Park, Tanzania
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** All witnesses to the event were given Class-A amnestics.

**Event Description:** All personal within provisional Site-████-█&#39;s life-support maintenance access tunnels reported hearing the voice of Agent ██████ ████ ████ from The █████ Project speak with distortion akin to being played over a speaker several inches from their ears. The content of said speech was calmly requesting staff to not engage in cannibalism despite there being no indication that anybody onsite had considered an act of that nature. The voice at several points attempted to use code phrases to convince staff that it was Agent ██████ ████ ████ but the codes were confirmed to be false codes given to D-███-██ while he was impersonating Agent ██████ ████ ████. Agent ██████ ████ ████ and D-███-██ had both died due to a train crash on the way to the The █████ Project command post before they could become involved in 1963.
**Date of Occurrence:** 11/06/1966
**Location:** Provisional Site-████-█, █████ lake.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** SCP-████-█ denied any involvement with the event and as far as can be determined is correct. No unusual circumstances have been discovered in Agent ██████ ████ ████ or D-███-██&#39;s deaths.

**Event Description:** All doors within the University of Wisconsin&#39;s Music Hall led to what is currently assumed to be an alternate version of the Music Hall. All students who entered this alternate hall were considered lost when the effect ceased, until all missing students exited the university through the main entrance two months later. According to the students, they had all been absent for an estimated ten or twelve minutes. 
**Date of Occurence:** 12/4/1999
**Location:** University of Wisconsin, Wisconsin, USA
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Affected students amnestitized, cover story of a class field trip spread. School placed under a ten year monitoring period.

**Event Description:** During the decommissioning and deconstruction of Specialized Laboratory 4389-UC!S-11 in Research Sector 8-Alpha of Site-15, ███████ █████ began to experience what was later determined to be a stroke and died in the site medical ward. At the time no actual anomaly was found and operations proceeded as normal. In 1984, Site-15 underwent a routine casual scan which detected retro-casual ectoentropic interference in the events of his death which was confirmed by further scans. To this day the actual alterations made and the entity responsible are unknown.
**Date of Occurrence:** 06/13/1977
**Location:** Site-15, Canada.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** ███████ █████&#39;s family was told that he died in a civilian construction operation. Deconstruction was completed in 1978 despite set-backs. The event was extensively investigated but no more more information has been gained. It is theorized that the Foundation&#39;s methods of detecting these events are flawed and simply reading a false negative but similar malfunctions have not been noted. The records of Site-15 were examined but none of the tests run in the Specialized Laboratory 4389-UC!S-11 had any known retro-casual or ectoentropic properties.

**Event Description:** Over a period of 23 minutes, Agent ███████ shrank to 5% her original height, before expiring due to low body temperature. No cause of this anomaly was found.
**Date of Occurrence.** 02/27/2012
**Location:** Area 52, India. 
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The next of kin was notified, and Agent ███████&#39;s very small body was delivered for burial.

**Event Description:** At --5:34-- --8:18-- --3:24-- a time, all individuals were unable to deduce the current time for approximately 45 minutes, despite the presence of functional timekeeping devices. All individuals who reference the event, regardless of their involvement, are similarly unable to deduce the time it occurred. 
**Date of Occurrence:** 06/12/2010
**Location:** California, Pennsylvania, USA. 
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** None.

**Event Description:** Four new species of landfowl, with entire populations including a domestic breed, spontaneously manifested worldwide. Similarly, all members of the species //Struthio Camelus Domesticus// vanished, alongside all infrastructure related to their breeding and consumption. The memories of roughly 99.7% of the population were simultaneously altered, causing retroactive acceptance. 
**Date of Occurrence.** 01/18/2008
**Location:** Worldwide
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Distance communication between the 0.3% of the population whose memories were not altered are being intercepted and altered by a Foundation AI.

**Event Description:** For 24 hours, any person entering the █████████ Laundromat would find themselves in a well-furnished Blockbuster video rental store. All reports stated that the titles of the films in the store did not correlate with any known films, some with titles in unknown languages. During the initial exploration of the anomaly, a letter was discovered at the front counter reading //&#34;I lost my job for this? They could have at least turned this place into an arcade or something.&#34;// After 24 hours had passed the spatial anomaly ceased all activity and the █████████ Laundromat could be accessed once again with no signs of anomalous activity.
**Date of Occurrence:** 08/12/2009
**Location:** █████████ Laundromat, Florida, USA. 
**Follow-Up Actions:** Due to the relatively new status of the building all individuals who witnessed the event were informed that the █████████ Laundromat was not complete and was currently being renovated from what was formerly a Blockbuster store.
**Note:** The building in which the anomaly occurred was formerly a Blockbuster store, which was classified as defunct several weeks prior to the current occupation of the █████████ Laundromat. The locations of the previous workers are currently unknown.

**Event Description:** For exactly one and a half hours, all staff at Site-97 spontaneously grew a second, far smaller version of their head on their right shoulder that did nothing but whisper cheese or dairy-related puns into their right ear. These heads could not be removed during the allotted time frame, and would only speak over any sort of audio distractions. After the one and a half hours passed, the heads all said in unison &#34;If you wanted more cheese puns, then that&#39;s just &#34;swiss&#34;-full thinking! Ha, get it?! It&#39;s a cheese pun!&#34; then proceeded to bud off from their original bodies and shrivel into piles of dust. 
**Date of Occurrence:** 03-02-2020
**Location:** Site-97, Alaska, USA.
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Entire site cleaned of dust piles created by anomalously formed heads. Cheese and dairy puns have been banned from Site-97 as staff used to be very fond of such jokes, which researchers suspect is what caused such an absurd event. Poster of claymation duo //Wallace and Gromit// has been removed due to the series&#39; connections with cheese. Site-97 is currently under watch due to this event.

**Event Description:** The pants worn by an unidentified man spontaneously burst into flames. Nearby patrons did not appear startled and instead simply collected available water and hurled it at the man&#39;s pants to quench the flames before returning to what they had been doing.

The train was removed and taken into Foundation custody where it has been monitored and studied for further anomalous properties. As of 4/19/20, none have been shown. Foundation personnel are currently working with UIU agents and British Occult Service officials to keep both stations under a 5 year monitoring period.

**Event Description:** All known humans situated within the general vicinity of a suburb in Seattle, Washington temporarily lost bodily autonomy and invariably maintained their forward velocity for approximately 35 seconds. These bodies were unimpeded by obstructions, with individuals intangibly passing through nearby structures. After the event had subsided, all affected individuals regained autonomy and tangibility, leading to mass cases of suffocation, with exact casualties yet to be accurately determined. 
**Date of Occurrence:** 07/16/2006
**Location:** Redmond, Washington, United States
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Widespread amnesticization efforts among affected individuals and families of victims were initiated. Heads of local groups of interest were queried for a potential explanation of the event&#39;s origins, to no avail. Notably, during this period, the networks of Microsoft, headquarters located in Redmond, Washington, encountered a brief outage.

**Event Description:** A low-frequency pitch was reported emitting from all ground sewers within a city center. Occasional flashes of light were also observed by civilians. This frequency increased in pitch until all glass constructions within close proximity of sewer entrances suddenly shattered, causing an estimated $████ USD in property damage.  
**Date Of Occurrence:** ██/██/2015
**Location:** Livingston, California, United States
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** All witnesses were administered Class-B amnestics. Video evidence of the event has been confiscated by the Foundation. CCTV monitors were installed around area to ensure safety of citizens.

**Event Description:** An entire mosasaurus skeleton materialized roughly 8 feet above the floor of █████ ██████████ Middle School, replacing all solid objects in space it occupied, though this was mostly ceiling tiles. The subsequent weight of this added mass and loss of structural integrity quickly led to the collapse of the western roof of the building.
**Date of Occurrence:** 05/06/2020
**Location:** ████████, Colorado, USA
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Due to quarantine measures already in place in ████████, the school was completely unoccupied and only two civilians witnessed the event, both of whom were administered amnestics. All video footage was recovered and replaced to match a cover story of unchecked mold growth and frequent rain leading to a roof collapse. The skeleton was found to have no signs of decay and was covered in fresh, recently-deceased mosasaurus tissue, and was moved to Site-███ for temporal-paleontological research and subsequent storage. The building is to be monitored until 05/31/2025 for future anomalous occurrences.

**Event Description:** One //Blatta orientalis// (Oriental Cockroach) grew to a length of 1.2 meters within a civilian residence. The specimen displayed frantic behavior before fleeing the home and impacted by a passing pickup truck. The residents of the house then contacted the local authorities while passersby began taking photographs of the insect. 
**Date of Occurrence:** 05/06/20██
**Location:** ██████ ████, Iowa, USA
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Foundation agents arrived shortly after the call was made and administered appropriate amnestic dosages after confiscating evidence of the event. Despite the efforts of Foundation entomologists, the cockroach perished due to breathing difficulties. Roughly 22 minutes after the cessation of life, the insect returned to average size while unobserved. The body was monitored for potential anomalous properties before disposed of via Site-██&#39;s industrial incinerator.

**Event Description:** A charred humanoid entity was seen on CCTV records logged in workplaces and industrial areas. Frequently observed to lay in a fetal position next to an indescribable organic mass for approximately five minutes before rousing and subsequently stepping onto the mass. Audio and video footage afterward damaged/deleted; corporate management denied involvement. 
**Date of Occurrence:** Unclear.
**Location:** Worldwide
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Interrogation attempts unsuccessful. Foundation agents have been embedded within areas of such occurrences posed as civilians. All records containing the event have been confiscated and transferred to Site-██ for further research. Amnestics have been administered accordingly along with regular information suppression tactics.

**Event Description:** On 21/██/20██, A team of 31 researchers, sailing through the Drake passage on an expedition to Antarctica, sighted what seemed to be a surfacing submarine 10km away off the coast of Smith Island. The expedition team, confused as they hadn&#39;t been informed of any submarines in the area, attempted to contact via radio but to no avail. A look through binoculars indicated that it was a military submarine, of unknown design, displaying an unknown flag. Not long after, a bright light and thunderous roar were seen and heard as a supposed missile was launched from the distant submarine, and travelled in an easterly direction. The submarine sank back down under the waves and was not seen again. The expedition was called off subsequently.
**Date of Occurrence:** 21/██/20██
**Location:** 6km NW of Smith Island, Antarctica.
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** The 31 researchers were interrogated individually and administered Class-A amnestics after. A covert foundation-led search team were deployed to the region to search for the rogue submarine, but found nothing after 14 months of searching. The launched missile, an SLBM, reached space and successfully deployed its stages. A single projectile, supposedly a warhead, was detected entering the atmosphere near Bouvet Island, but didn&#39;t detonate. Warhead and missile debris were never recovered. The file of this event remains in Site-██ awaiting further investigation.

**Event Description:** The sky visible from inside Site-19 became pale red for 5 seconds, during which the text &#34;SQUONKIPEDIA&#34; in bold white lettering rapidly moved across the sky.
**Date of Occurrence:** 09/12/2019
**Location:** Site-19
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** None, due to all witnesses being Foundation personnel. The cause of this is under investigation.

//Note: No known organization or popular media element with the name &#34;Squonkipedia&#34; has been identified.//

**Event Description** All doorways and windows to Site-25&#39;s northeastern guard tower converted into impermeable opaque barriers and communication with the tower was lost. The event immediately ended upon a drilling attempt successfully breaching the floor. For the duration of the event, muffled shouting and construction noises were heard emanating from the inside, although all personnel rescued from the tower report instead hearing an &#34;unearthly warbling&#34; emanating from the outside.
**Date of Occurrence:** 08/05/2020
**Location:** Site-25
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Due to security concerns, the tower may not be closed for more than 24 hours. As subsequent investigations found no anomalous items or entities, no changes will be made to guard schedules. Further anomalous events relating to this location are to be reported immediately.

**Event Description:** At 9:32am, an instrumental piece of music, lasting 3 minutes and 52 seconds, and with composition style resembling that of a national anthem, began playing from the geometric center of the ██████████████ Building of the ██████████████ University, prompting every person within hearing range to interrupt their current activities, stand up with their hand over their heart, and passionately sing along in an unknown language for the duration of the piece, after which they proceeded to resume their activities as if nothing had happened. 
**Date of Occurrence:** 03/11/2019
**Location:** Bogotá, Colombia
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Security camera footage retrieved and destroyed, mock footage created to replace it. Witnesses interviewed. All witnesses involved retained clear memories of the event, but showed disinterest or outright aversion in discussing it. None of them seemed willing to mention the event unprompted, and when questioned about it either tried to deflect to other topic, claiming disinterest, or outright refused to discuss it. Amnestics proved ineffective in removing memories of the event. However, due to the unlikeliness of them deciding to discuss it on their own accord, and the destruction of the only footage of the event, amnestic treatment has been deemed unnecessary for the time being. Witnesses are to be placed on a 5-year observation period to detect any potential changes in their behavior and/or the self-containing nature of the event.

**Event Description:** An as-yet unidentified woman, dressed in what witnesses described as &#34;steampunk-style&#34; clothing, was seen walking a live thylacine (//Thylacinus cynocephalus//) down a busy street.  When approached, she was heard to warn the approaching person or persons away by saying, &#34;Careful, she bites,&#34; in a Boston accent.  After walking the animal for twenty-five minutes, she and the animal entered a taxicab, which promptly drove away.  It is worthy of note that the thylacine is known to have been extinct since 1936.
**Date of Occurrence:** 4/8/2020
**Location:** New York City, NY
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Cover story of a promotional event for a movie shoot circulated.  Through questioning of eyewitnesses, the Foundation was able to trace the woman&#39;s starting point to another taxicab at the intersection of [REDACTED].  Neither of the cabs has been identified, despite considerable effort.  The cabs in question have not been found to belong to any taxi company in the city.  Descriptions of the drivers have not been helpful, largely due to the fact that eyewitnesses were captivated by the strangely-dressed woman and her pet.

**Event Description:** A public telephone outside of an abandoned grocery store began to ring.  A young woman picked up the receiver and heard a heavily-distorted voice say, &#34;Everything you thought you knew is wrong.&#34;  When she asked what the voice meant, it answered by saying, &#34;The world is not what you think it is.&#34;  Further questions did not elicit answers, only similar phrases.  After nearly three minutes, the woman hung up the phone in frustration.
**Date of Occurrence:** 6/8/2020
**Location:** Miami, FL
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Telephone in question examined and discovered not to be connected to any telephone lines.  Investigation revealed that the telephone had not been connected since 2002 and is only still in place because of a dispute about who should be responsible for its removal.  Interviews with the woman provided no useful details; woman was amnesticized.  Telephone placed under observation for 5 years.

**Event Description:** Every human (//Homo sapiens//) on Earth simultaneously lost consciousness for approximately one second. Recording devices left running during this period show that all affected people abruptly screamed for the entire duration of the event.
**Date of Occurrence:** 7/9/2020, 3:23:42 GMT
**Location:** Worldwide
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Published evidence of event removed and edited, hoax websites developed to paint event as conspiracy theory.

**Event Description:** A Western Rock Lobster (//Panulirus cygnus//) transmuted into a live human infant whilst being boiled alive.
**Date of Occurrence:** 09/9/2019
**Location:** Geraldton, Western Australia.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All witnesses were administered Class-A amnestics. A window at the Jefferson house had to be repaired. Autopsy revealed the DNA of the carcass was identical to that of an ordinary human. Remains of the infant were cremated and buried.

**Event Description:** A team of seven archeologists attempted to open the sarcophagus of Cleopatra. Within the sarcophagus, no body was discovered; however, a single living bee had left the tomb after being opened and proceeded to escape. The location of the specimen is unknown at this time.
**Date of Occurence:** 2/3/2018
**Location:** Alexandria, Egypt
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Archeologists amnesticized. The public perception of Cleopatra&#39;s tomb is to be maintained as lost or currently unknown.

**Event Description:** A woman got up from her table at a restaurant and walked directly toward the women&#39;s restroom in a straight line, passing through several other tables and diners in the process.  Security footage of the event shows the woman appearing to wade as she passes through solid objects, as though walking through deep water.
**Date of Occurrence:** 29/9/2020
**Location:** New York City, New York
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Witnesses interviewed and amnesticized. Security footage copied for Foundation records, original files deleted.  The woman was placed under observation for future anomalous abilities, to continue until 2025.

**Event Description:** A school basketball match between the Marymount School of New York and New Anglia international school. The only anomalous event related to this match was its location and date of occurrence.  
**Date of Occurrence:**  20/06/1969
**Location:** West Crater, Lunar Surface
**Follow-up Actions taken:** Apollo 11 crew provided with Class-A amnestics. Footage of the landing edited and cut to remove all traces of the game. Students involved lost memory of the incident naturally.

**Event Description:** All of the dogs in a local dog park were replaced by Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches (//Gromphadorhina portentosa//). Roaches were all the same size as the dogs that were replaced, and the effect lasted for about five and a half minutes before the dogs reappeared unfazed.
**Date of Occurrence:** 03/12/2020
**Location:** Dog park in Revere, Massachusetts. 
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All pet owners were given Class A Amnestics and all camera footage was seized by Foundation personnel.

**Event Description:** Edward Jacobs, age 34, described as a tall and thin Caucasian man with short curly brown hair and pale green eyes, entered a single-occupancy bathroom in an antique store, but did not exit.  The man who exited the bathroom was noticeably short and slightly overweight.  His identification showed that he was Alex Wong, age 22.  Mr. Wong was not in the bathroom at the time Mr. Jacobs entered.  Witnesses could not recall ever having seen him before, but did not regard his presence as unusual.
**Date of Occurrence:** 19-1-2021
**Location:** New York City, NY
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Alex Wong was detained and questioned.  His testimony revealed nothing unusual, and amnestic treatment was deemed unnecessary.  Cover story of a missing person enabled Foundation agents to obtain the owner&#39;s permission to search the entire store, even the areas customers are not permitted to enter.  Edward Jacobs was not located and has been classified as a Person of Interest.

**Event Description:** A young woman visiting an office building for a job interview discovered a male white rhinoceros wearing a security guard&#39;s hat.  Staff in the building referred to the rhinoceros as &#34;Jake.&#34;  The young woman made a short video and uploaded it to the popular video hosting site [REDACTED], where it was discovered by Foundation web crawlers, prompting an investigation.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2-4-2021
**Location of Occurrence:** Seattle, WA
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** After being found to be non-anomalous, the rhinoceros was taken to a nearby zoo.  The video was removed from the video hosting site.  The young woman who made the video was interviewed, as were staff at the building.  All staff assumed that the rhinoceros was a member of security staff and found nothing unusual about this.  All involved were given class A amnestics.

**Event Description:** A mannequin in a window display at a women&#39;s clothing store became a living woman.  She maintained the pose the mannequin had been placed in, merely watching those nearby with mild interest.  She remained in this state for 1 minute and 23 seconds before becoming a mannequin again.
**Date of Occurrence:** 3-5-2021
**Location of Occurrence:** New York City, New York
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Uploaded photos and videos of the event allowed to remain in place.  A cover story regarding a movie promotion was circulated.  Staff at the store were interviewed.  No member of staff recognized the woman, although most claimed she looked familiar.

**Event Description:** After drinking a full 1-liter bottle of a generic soft drink, a teenage boy was able to belch the entire first verse of the Swedish national anthem in a single breath.
**Date of Occurrence:** 3-10-2021
**Location of Occurrence:** Chicago, Illinois, USA
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The boy and all present when the event occurred interviewed and amnesticized.  No useful information was gained.
**Note:** //No one had any Swedish ancestry, knowledge of Sweden beyond the most basic geographical information, or knowledge of the Swedish national anthem.  When the song was played by one of the responding agents, none of those interviewed were able to recognize it.  Yet another mystery we&#39;ll probably never be able to solve.// - Dr. Malkin

**Event Description:** Approximately all flags in Washington D. C. became the now-popular &#39;Gay Pride&#39; flag. All instances of the US flag in the District disappeared, and were found the following day in the capitol building with a label reading &#39;Happy Gay Pride month! Sorry for borrowing these.&#39; The object was scanned for fingerprints and video recordings were observed, the person responsible was unable to be located. The following occurred in 2019 on the same date to a similar effect, and the person responsible for the events was still unable to be traced.
**Date of Occurrence:** 06-11-2009 / 06-11-2019
**Location of Occurrence:** Washington, District of Columbia
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The President of the US, all American political figures, and all present were given Class-A Amnestics on both occasions. Flags were removed and replaced with the modern incarnation of the flag of the United States before amnestics were administered on both occasions.
**Note:** //This happened to have occurred on both the Tenth and Twentieth anniversaries of the US&#39;s &#39;Gay Pride Month&#39; holiday. Whoever did this sure likes the occasion. -Dr. Ypres//

**Event Description:** The words WONPON suddenly appeared in the night sky, seemingly made of out flames, for 15 minutes before disappearing. The source of the lights is currently unknown. 
**Date of Occurrence:** 7-03-2021
**Location of Occurrence:** Rama&#39;s Bridge, Indian Ocean
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Significant clean-up efforts deemed unnecessary, as most witnesses mistook the event for fireworks. Any individuals found to be spreading information opposite of this were amnestied, and evidence supporting the idea of fireworks has been dispersed among the population. 

**Event Description:** A man sitting on a bench in a subway station was heard to say something about having forgotten his phone.  This was presumably in response to a smartphone at the opposite end of the bench.  The man remained sitting, but another man completely identical to him stepped out of his body, walked to the opposite end of the bench, retrieved the phone, and returned.  When the second man sat down, he appeared to merge into the first.
**Date of Occurrence:** 4-13-2021
**Location of Occurrence:** Chicago, IL
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** As this event happened very late at night, few witnesses were present.  All witnesses described the event accurately, but seemed oddly disinterested, as though nothing out of the ordinary had occurred.  As no useful information could be gained, witnesses were given low-level amnestic treatment.  The man responsible for the event has been placed under Foundation surveillance until 2026.

**Event Description:** An entry was submitted to the site which described an anomalous item which does not exist. The entry was submitted by a terminal which had ceased functioning several days prior to the entry&#39;s creation.
**Date of Occurrence:** 5-23-2022
**Location of Occurrence:** Site-64
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The terminal was removed from the SciPNET intranet connection and efforts to find the culprit are underway.

**Event Description:** A number of food items within a local McDonald&#39;s restaurant suddenly animated and restructured themselves to resemble a number of animals native to the area. The entities then proceeded to attack the staff before fleeing into the surrounding wilderness and disappearing.
**Date of Occurrence:** 12-5-2020
**Location of Occurrence:** Blackfoot, ID
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All customers and staff present were interrogated and given amnestics, with the restaurant&#39;s manager going on record saying, &#34;It was Carl&#39;s boys, I just know it! They&#39;re always pulling crap like this!&#34; An investigation into the neighboring Carl&#39;s Jr. restaurant has since been launched.

**Event Description:** An as-yet unidentified man removed his baseball cap, revealing a small purple cloud on top of his head, which had been completely concealed by the hat.  The cloud floated away in what witnesses described as an unhurried manner.  It has not been located.
**Date of Occurrence:** 4-26-21
**Location of Occurrence:** Cincinnati, OH
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** As neither the man nor the cloud could be located by the time the Foundation arrived, and there was no way to determine who had seen the event, low-grade amnestics were dispersed over the entire area via aerosol.

**Event Description:** Known person of interest POI-11705 manifested a Glock 19 pistol and began to float in a standing posture. POI passed through the bottom of an elevated freeway as if intangible, emerged out the top and began to travel along the freeway, firing his pistol in the air while still intersecting with the freeway. POI made an abrupt upward motion while &#34;dabbing&#34; before exploding into fireworks.
**Date of Occurrence:** 5/10/2021
**Location of Occurrence:** Los Angeles, CA
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-A amnestics administered to witnesses. Cover story of an illegal firework show implemented.

**Event Description:** Shortly after one woman entered an elevator in an office building, 13 copies of the same woman exited the elevator.  According to witnesses, the women were completely identical in every respect and all answered to the same name.  Six minutes and 47 seconds later, all but one of the women demanifested, leaving nothing behind.
**Date of Occurrence:** 5-19-2021
**Location of Occurrence:** Austin, TX
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Witnesses interviewed and amnesticized.  None of the witnesses regarded the event as unusual in any way, and seemed puzzled by interviewers&#39; suggestions to the contrary.

**Event Description:** For 0.0000002 seconds, the entire population of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, was teleported to Monrovia, Liberia, before being teleported back; no body was harmed and there were no follow up effects on either Monrovia or Ho Chi Minh.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2-22-1979
**Location of Occurrence:** Ho Chi Minh City and Monrovia
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Due to the fact that it was a very short amount of time and that it was midnight in Vietnam, most of the civilians did not notice. Those who did were given amnestics; a cover up story was spread in Monrovia of chemical smog playing tricks on the mind.

**Event Description:** An abandoned building became a pleasant, well-kept suburban home with obvious signs of habitation.  Foundation investigation discovered that it was owned by a man named Edward Jacobs, age 32.  He claimed to have lived there alone for 4 years, after his mother moved out to be closer to her ailing sister.  When interviewed, neighbors corroborated his story.  A search of public records discovered that no one with the last name Jacobs had ever lived in the area and there was no such person as Edward Jacobs.
**Date of Occurrence:** 1-1-2021
**Location of Occurrence:** Suburb of Cleveland, OH
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** As the anomalous nature of Edward Jacobs&#39;s existence in the region appears to be largely unknown, he was allowed to continue living in his current location.  His property has been placed under Foundation surveillance until 2026.  At the time of writing, no further anomalous activity has been reported.
**Note:** //One of the clerks at the local courthouse spoke kindly of Edward Jacobs, calling him &#34;a nice young man,&#34; even after showing us evidence that the property has been vacant since 2018.  This kind of thing is above my pay grade.// - Agent Walters

**Event Description:** A group of male Eclectus parrots (//Eclectus roratus//) in a zoo were seen developing humanoid heads and reciting &#34;a song about bananas&#34;. Security footage failed to capture the event, although the occurrence was corroborated by multiple witnesses. Anomalous group hallucination assumed. 
**Date of Occurrence:** 6/3/2021
**Location:**  Ann Arbor, MI
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** People known to be in the area of the bird enclosure were given low-strength amnestics.

**Event Description:** An adult male western lowland gorilla //(gorilla gorilla gorilla)// entered a local playground and began to play on the equipment.  Multiple children happily interacted with the gorilla as though it were another child, and were seen to be very friendly toward it.  Nearby parents were reported to be disinterested in the gorilla&#39;s presence.  After 7 minutes and 38 seconds, the gorilla entered a nearby public restroom, and did not emerge.  No trace of the gorilla was found afterward.
**Date of Occurrence:** 6/3/2021
**Location of Occurrence:** Cincinnati, OH
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All witnesses, both children and adults, were interviewed.  Children did not appear to find the gorilla&#39;s presence unusual.  Adults were disbelieving of the event, saying such things as &#34;children have such imaginations.&#34;  All witnesses were amnesticized, and the playground was placed under Foundation surveillance.

**Event Description:** Two people ran in opposite directions, to see which one their dog would follow.  Rather than following one or the other, the dog split into two identical dogs and followed both of them at once.  When the two people returned to close proximity, the dogs merged back into one.
**Date of Occurrence:** 6/6/2021
**Location of Occurrence:** Buffalo, NY
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Video of the event had already been posted to social media by the time it was brought to the attention of the Foundation. The video was promptly removed and dismissed as a hoax.  Witnesses were located and given amnestic treatment.

**Event Description:** The top three participants in a bodybuilding competition had their muscle mass decreased by roughly 55% each, as they stepped on the podium. The only noted side effects were excess skin, and mental distress.
**Date of Occurrence:** 10/6/2021
**Location of Occurrence:** Los Angeles, California, USA
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Inspection of the locale, the podium, as well as all products (Tanning products, bodybuilding equipment, etc.) used by the competitors revealed no anomalies. Video recordings of the event were taken down, and all witnesses and competitors were administered amnestics.

**Event Description:** Dancers onstage at a concert performed a series of elaborate movements which are anatomically impossible, including several that defied the laws of physics.
**Date of Occurrence:** 21/6/2021
**Location of Occurrence:** Miami, FL
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** As the event was being broadcast live to local TV stations, large-scale amnestic treatment was deemed useless.  Fortunately for the Foundation, no members of the audience seemed to be aware of the anomalous nature of the dance, viewing it as some form of clever trickery.  When interviewed, the dancers claimed to have learned the dance from an online video.  However, the video in question could not be found.  Investigation into the video is still ongoing, and the person responsible for making it has been classified as a Person of Interest.

**Event Description:** During a record-breaking heat wave, a woman was heard to complain about how hot it was.  An unidentified man immediately manifested in front of her and began to lecture her on how hot it was where he came from, frequently using the phrase &#34;You don&#39;t know what real heat is.&#34;  After 2 minutes and 17 seconds, the man de-manifested.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2/7/2021
**Location of Occurrence:** Seattle, WA
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All witnesses were interviewed and amnesticized.  No witnesses were able to identify the man, and no one saw him arrive, leading to the conclusion that he manifested in place.  A sketch was created based on the man&#39;s description, and he has been labeled a Person of Interest.

**Event Description:** Population within a 2-mile radius of ████████ formed a seemingly temporary hivemind and restrained ██████████████. For the next hour and 37 minutes, they attempt to expose ██████████████ to multiple sources of bright lights ranging from lights from cell phones to 7000 Lumen Halogen lights while restraining and forcibly holding ██████████████ eyes open. Afterwards, the temporary hive mind had subsided, leaving connected members confused and disoriented. 
**Date of Occurrence:** 6/7/2021
**Location:** Noblesville, Indiana
**Follow-Up actions:** All who were involved were interviewed, amnesticized, and taken back to their homes. ██████████████ was both interviewed and evaluated by a medical team, and was noted as being passive, compliant, and having slowed reaction times. Before being amnesticized, ██████████████ was confirmed to have gone colorblind (specifically Deuteranopia). Investigation of the home of ██████████████ is noted have a sizeable amount of sloth paraphernalia. Three members of the defunct MTF Iota-5 have been sent to observe the region for a 4 month time frame to ensure return to normality.

**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Hotel searched under the cover story of a missing person.  No trace of Elizabeth Simmons could be located.  Hotel staff, convention staff, and convention attendees were interviewed, and no one remembered anyone named Elizabeth Simmons.  All those interviewed remembered Jessica Watkins having attended the convention instead.  Thorough investigation revealed no evidence that Jessica Watkins existed before the event.
**Note:** //This particular Jessica Watkins, that is.  It&#39;s a relatively common name, but none of those found to have existed previously matched the woman&#39;s description.// - Agent Thompson

**Event Description:** All Foundation personnel viewing their work email accounts from 00:08:08 to 00:09:09 GMT reported observing the presence of several unusual messages from other Foundation staff, all of whom have denied responsibility. Analysis of security footage reveals no obvious discrepancies beyond the reactions of 15 affected personnel, most of whom either contacted technical support or reported a potential cognitohazard and requested immediate amnesticization. Two personnel violated proper procedures and attempted to record the contents of the emails to the best of their ability, though due to its perception-based nature the only extant record is one Post-It Note and its subsequent transcriptions. Remembered email subjects confirmed to possess no infohazardous properties include &#34;Void Duty - Transfer Request&#34;, &#34;SCP-2165 Autopsy Report&#34;, and several references to rain such as &#34;Blue Rain Memo #004&#34;, &#34;Rainfall Increase Data&#34;, &#34;D.R.Y.S.N.O.

**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** All witnesses interviewed and amnesticized.  Wall examined, found to be completely solid and non-anomalous.  Security camera videos erased under the cover story of a malfunction.  Recording of the noises made by the man taken for further analysis.  Attempts to discover which business he was working for are ongoing, but made difficult by the fact that the only visible writing on his uniform is in an unknown and as-yet indecipherable script.

**Event Description:** Files containing Foundation training videos had their contents replaced with much more unprofessional, lower-quality videos, consisting of individuals who allegedly are employed by the Foundation reading off virtual slideshows near-verbatim. On average, this quadrupled the duration of each training video.
**Date of Occurrence:** 14/3/2022
**Location of Occurrence:** Site-79
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Files contained, with new versions of the videos loaded onto Site-79&#39;s servers from a backup.

**Event Description:** A telephone in a painting began to ring, with a sound appropriate to the style of the painted telephone.  When a night watchman answered, a female voice asked for Tiffany, which happened to be the name of his daughter.  When informed that Tiffany wasn&#39;t available, the caller announced that she&#39;d call back later and hung up.
**Date of Occurrence:** 22 May 2022
**Location of Occurrence:** Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City, NY, USA
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Since this occurred late at night, very little action was required.  The night watchman was interviewed, and seemed to find nothing unusual about having a conversation over a telephone in a painting. Witness was amnesticized following interview and placed under Foundation surveillance in the event of further anomalous activity.

**Event Description:** A plate of spaghetti noodles became animate and attempted to strangle a diner.  Witnesses described the animate spaghetti as &#34;absolutely furious&#34;, but were unable to articulate what gave them this impression.  Despite its best efforts, the spaghetti was unable to do any damage, and became inanimate again shortly afterwards.
**Date of Occurrence:** 16 June 2022
**Location of Occurrence:** An Italian restaurant in Fresno, CA
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Review of security video revealed an unidentified man wearing a stereotypical chef outfit in the kitchen, dusting the spaghetti with an as-of-yet unknown substance. When interviewed, several members of kitchen staff were able to recall seeing him, but were unable to identify either him or the substance.

**Time of Occurrence:** May 2nd, 2014
**Location of Occurrence:** Columbus, Ohio, USA
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** An investigation of Columbus, Ohio has been launched, examining events that occurred prior to and immediately following the incident, determining potential anomalous activity within the region, and interrogating all citizens of the town. Due to the scale of the incident, large-scale premeditated murder via anomalous means is currently believed to be the most likely cause.
**UPDATE - 9 May 2014:**It was discovered that at 17:20 hours, one John Zimmerman returned to their home after ~10 hours of work at the nearby █████████ Corporation office building. Zimmerman described the work day as having been &#39;extremely rough&#39;. Once home, Zimmerman proceeded to drop an entire plate of spaghetti on his shoes and subsequently stub his toe during the cleanup. It was determined that Zimmerman stubbing his toe coincided exactly with the deaths of the anomalous individuals. Zimmerman is also noted to have had a history of anger management issues. Zimmerman has been amnestized and enrolled within anger management courses by the Foundation via a front company.

**Event Description:** A human corpse was observed to fall out of the sky. Corpse&#39;s appearance is an exact match with person of interest &#34;Dan Cooper&#34; or &#34;D.B.

**Date of Occurrence:** 11/14/2022
**Location:** ███████ ██ █████ ████ School, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** ██ schoolchildren and █ staff were amnesticized. All footage of the event, taken on 6 cellular phones, 2 digital cameras, and 1 portable film camera, was seized. No persisting spatial anomalies have been found with the wall or ejected items.

**Event Description:** During the course of a highly classified espionage mission, plainclothes Agent ██ D██████ was approached by an individual who repeatedly and loudly introduced themselves as ████████ D██████-Y███, the supposed future child of Agent D██████. The individual proceeded to make a variety of crass, unlikely, and occasionally contradictory claims of future events, only 05.891% of which will occur, before violently kicking Agent D██████&#39;s crotch with a steel-toed boot. Upon D██████ collapsing to the ground, their attacker spat on the agent and started becoming transluscent while saying &#34;Fuck you, fuck your timeline, and fuck your kids. Sunday morning, December 14th, 2053, mom cries, [REDACTED] pays for your funeral services.&#34; The individual then disappeared.
**Date of Occurrence:** 11/14/2022
**Location:** [REDACTED], Afghanistan
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Agent D██████ sustained only minor injuries from his assault and is expected to make a full recovery. Saliva from his shirt has been analyzed and found to bear no close genetic match to D██████ or any high-ranking Foundation staff. As D██████ won&#39;t die until ██/██/206█, his attacker is assumed to have been sent by a hostile group of interest with false information to waste Temporal Department or Prognostication Department resources, and D██████ has been informed of this falsehood. 

**Event Description:** At the end of ███████████&#39;s final day of business before being shut down, all eight mannequins in the store animated and ran towards the front display window before turning to face the remaining staff and patrons. The mannequins then linked hands and bowed synchronously before deanimating in positions normally impossible for their frames.
**Date of Occurrence:** 22/11/2022
**Location:** ███████████, a clothing store in █████████, Michoacán, Mexico
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Class-A amnestics were dispensed to all staff and patrons and all relevant security footage was seized. The involved mannequins have been contained but have not yet displayed any anomalous properties.

**Event Description:** D-466622 had a dream in which ze interacted with several one-armed, one-legged, vaguely humanoid entities that referred to themselves as &#34;gobs&#34; and was offered a finite supply of free shoes in exchange for hir firstborn son. D-466622 agreed to these terms and immediately awoke under a pile of 73 left-foot Nike shoes of varying size, model, and condition. All dormitory cameras in view of D-466622 show the spontaneous appearance of these shoes between the frames 00:26:48.317 and 00:26:48.333 with minor air disturbances expected from a Type-III translocational mid-air displacement.
**Date of Occurrence:** 05-12-2022
**Location:** D-Class Dormitory #B-SL401, Bunk C-40
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Testing showed all shoes to be non-anomalous. Due to the lack of matching right shoes and resulting redundancy, all instances were incinerated. D-466622 is sterile, and so is expected to experience no further interaction with the so-called &#34;gobs&#34;. Standard Covert Former D-Class Monitoring Procedures will be conducted until 5 years after D-466622&#39;s termination of employment.
