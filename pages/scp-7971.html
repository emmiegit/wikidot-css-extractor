**Item #:** SCP-7971

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7971 instances are to be monitored through a dedicated financial tracking system maintained by Foundation accountants. Any individual identified as being overdue on taxes and at risk of SCP-7971 manifestation must be immediately located and the outstanding tax debt paid in full. All Foundation personnel are required to comply with tax regulations to avoid attracting SCP-7971 instances.

**Description:** SCP-7971 collectively refers to a group of anomalous entities resembling agents of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in appearance and behavior. Physical appearance varies, although all instances appear to be wearing a black suit and trousers[[footnote]] The &#34;clothing appears to be fused on the entire body of SCP-7971 [[/footnote]]. Instances of SCP-7971 manifest when an individual is significantly overdue on their taxes. These entities exhibit extreme hostility towards the targeted individual, pursuing them relentlessly until the outstanding tax debt is paid.

SCP-7971 instances possess reality-bending capabilities that allow them to bypass conventional means of containment. They can materialize in any location, regardless of security measures in place. Their primary objective is to seize and drain the bank accounts of the delinquent individual through anomalous means, leading to financial ruin and often resulting in the death of the individual.

The manifestation of SCP-7971 is accompanied by auditory hallucinations resembling tax-related warnings and notices. Victims commonly report hearing phrases such as &#34;Tax evasion is a serious crime&#34; and &#34;IRS agents are on their way.&#34; 

Research is ongoing to develop countermeasures against SCP-7971 manifestations, including exploring the feasibility of utilizing anomalous and automated accounting practices to satisfy their criteria without causing harm to the affected individuals.

**Addendum 7971-01:** Incident Log
SCP-7971 instances were first encountered following an incident involving Mr. ███████, a tax delinquent who failed to pay his outstanding taxes for several years. SCP-7971 manifested at Mr. ███████&#39;s residence, displaying a relentless pursuit. Despite the Foundation&#39;s efforts to intervene, conventional weaponry proved ineffective against SCP-7971.

Upon payment of the overdue taxes by Foundation personnel, SCP-7971 instances dematerialized. However, subsequent investigation revealed that Mr. ███████ suffered severe psychological trauma and financial depletion.

**Addendum 7971-02:** Unexplained Phenomena
SCP-7971 instances have been observed employing unconventional methods to locate tax evaders, including the ability to decipher encrypted financial information and anticipate attempts to conceal assets. Investigations are ongoing to understand the full extent of SCP-7971&#39;s capabilities.
