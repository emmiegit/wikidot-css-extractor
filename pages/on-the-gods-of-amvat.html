++ Chronicle of Ulak the Drifter

+++ Annotated by Shahrazad Keret

&#34;Gods are the forces of the Cosmos given thought and will,&#34; wrote the renowned theologian Viai Somn.[[footnote]] Viai Somn is not native to Midgard, nor do they seem to be a resident of Ulak&#39;s realm. – S.K. [[/footnote]]  &#34;They are born from it, made from the very fabric of existence. From their own flesh, they build worlds and seed life. They were here when Creation started, and they will guide it until its end, when only the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/three-short-scenes-about-death | All-Death]]] remains. As such, trying to kill them is like trying to kill gravity, or fire, or war or philosophy. Yes, they can be bound, banished and defeated. Their temples can be ransacked, their followers exterminated, and their avatars destroyed.[[footnote]] According to Somn, most gods eventually stop manifesting in the mortal realms of their own volition, rather than fading away due to waning worshippers.  [[/footnote]]  They can be cast down and their spirit sent tumbling into the Halls of Death.[[footnote]] Death gods are usually regarded as administrators and keepers of the mortal spirits that enter their domains. However, when it comes to their own brethren, they act as hosts while also determining when it is appropriate for them ascend once more. Mictlāntēcutli, for example, has a penchant for making it very hard for his divine guests to leave Mictlān. [[/footnote]] [[footnote]] Osiris is one of the few deities that had his divine essence butchered, which explains why he, while still alive in some form, did not return until Isis recovered most of his pieces. – S.K. [[/footnote]]  Yet the gods always return. It may take them millennia,[[footnote]] Cronus and the Titans, for example, were freed from Tartarus by the Olympians around the Earth year 2067. – S.K.  [[/footnote]]  even eons, but they will always rise from the Pit and continue to lord over Creation. Such is the nature of all gods: deathless patrons and guardians, protectors and lawmakers.&#34;[[footnote]] Taken from //On the Nature of Gods, Spirits, and other Trans-Dimensional Beings//, by Viai Somn, date unknown. [[/footnote]]   

If an //Amvatiaa// heard these words, they would surely laugh with incredulity. On this world, Somn is a madman, a fool and a heretic. No one in their right mind would ever consider the gods to be benevolent patrons and guides. The gods of this world are primordial beings, sheer forces of nature that create and destroy without any real purpose. They lack the cognitive ability to become patrons of culture, and they have no interest in the development of sapient life on their domains. While other first-generation deities, like Erebus and Gaea,[[footnote]] See //Genealogy of the Divine: from the Demiurge to the New Gods//, by Hykl Veritas, 3022 A.D. – S.K. [[/footnote]] [[footnote]] See //Party of Gods, Volume X// by Ulak the Drifter, circa 2006 A.D. – S.K. [[/footnote]] are inconceivably wise, Amvat&#39;s gods are little more than savage animals. As such, they do not heed prayers and only give something in return when fed through sacrifice. They attack and consume their devout and their enemies alike. To them, the //Amvatiaa// are little more than prey.

There are, of course, a few gods that escape this description. They are the gods that shaped life on Amvat and allowed it to flourish even in this hellish landscape. The following is a list of all named Amvatian deities and spirits, along with a brief, comprehensive description of each.

[[div_ class=&#34;fancyhr&#34;]]

+++ Primordial Gods

[[tabview]]
[[tab Duum-Nok-Nai]]
Duum-Nok-Nai (literally, &#34;He Who Brings the Night&#34;), god of the night, cold and darkness, Father of the Stars,[[footnote]] The Stars are minor deities known collectively as Nyn-Lum (&#34;the Lesser Lights&#34;). [[/footnote]] the Frigid One, Keeper of the Void, His Black Majesty, the Dark Ancestor, the Formless King, is the oldest, most powerful deity known on Amvat. He is a primaveral force, an uncaring and unfathomable god whose flesh is the very darkness that surrounds Amvat at night and whose breath is the deathly cold that covers the land. 

At the beginning of time, Duum-Nok-Nai mated with Visuil-Loh, the Sky Goddess, who gave birth to divine children; first the Stars and then the twin Suns that scorch Amvat&#39;s surface. 

After the birth of the Suns, the Formless King left his mate&#39;s side along with their eldest children, the Stars, who were as frigid as he was. This marked the Great Divide between day and night. Since then, the Dark Ancestor has remained relatively passive, inattentive to the events unfolding elsewhere in the Cosmos and utterly indifferent to the harm his power causes to the inhabitants of Amvat, a world whose existence he barely acknowledges.

[[/tab]]

[[tab Visuil-Loh]]
Visuil-Loh (&#34;The Blue Maiden&#34;), goddess of the sky, Mother of the Suns, Keeper of Light, the Eternal Regent, the Queen in Light, the Vast One, is the consort of Duum-Nok-Nai and the other primordial deity known to the //Amvatiaa//. She came into being at the same time as the Dark God and serves as his counterpart and contrast. She is nearly as powerful and, like him, cares little for the cosmos she has helped shape. 

While her mate favored their elder children, Visuil-Loh seemed not to care much for them, instead favoring their youngest daughters, the Suns. When the Great Divide came, Visuil-Loh ceded a part of her domains to the Stars and their father, while keeping the Suns under her eternal watch. She alternates observance of Amvat with Duum-Nok-Nai and only meets him to copulate at twilight. Like her lover, little more is known of her, since she is a primordial entity with no cults or worshippers centered around her figure. Her legends are scarce and there is no registry of her or her consort ever interfering in the affairs of other gods. For the most part, the Blue Maiden is unconcerned with Amvat, and only pays attention to it to maintain the balance of the Cosmos.

+++ Celestial Gods

[[tabview]]
[[tab Huul-Kot and Huul-Nian]]
Huul-Kot (&#34;White Sun”) and Huul-Nian (&#34;Golden Sun&#34;), goddesses of the Suns, fire and heat, Light Bearers, the Twin Empresses, They Who Hold the Flaming Crown, Mothers of Amvat, are the twin solar goddesses who brought Amvat into existence. While their parents are mostly uncaring, indifferent deities, the Suns are egotistical, cruel and demanding. They created Amvat on a whim, seeing it as a plaything, but soon left it to its own devices, preferring to wait for any life to evolve to subject it to suffering. The twins often bicker over which one of them is the most worshipped Sun and sometimes they even emit solar flares to intimidate the //Amvatiaa// into offering ever more costly tributes and sacrifices.

Although they are creator deities, the Suns have never played any significant role on Amvat besides heating its surface to allow life to develop.[[footnote]] This is quite unusual, even for a world as harsh as Amvat, for nearly all creator deities, from the Rainbow Serpent to Tengri, tend to be actively involved in their world&#39;s development. – S.K. [[/footnote]]  They are considered malevolent goddesses that must be appeased for life to prevail, and all sacrifices to them involve the immolation of living subjects. This grisly task is carried on all three cities of the Blessed Triad by an order of priests known as the //Divkar-Kol//, the Grey Men.[[footnote]] The name comes from the fact that these priests cover themselves in the ashes of those who have been sacrificed.  [[/footnote]]  Every certain number of days, criminals and enemies of the cities are thrown into a massive pyre at the center of the Red Temples and incinerated for the glory of the Twin Goddesses. This is not a ceremony born from love or faith. 

There is no devotion for the Suns beyond fear and pain. The Red Temples, colossal, hollow cylinders dedicated to them, are mostly adorned with grim scenes of fire and death. For the //Amvatiaa//, the Suns are merely two monsters in the sky whose hunger must be satisfied to keep them from engulfing the entire planet with their flames.

[[/tab]]

[[tab Kial-Um]]
Kial-Um (&#34;Moon King&#34;), god of the Moons,[[footnote]] There are three moons orbiting Amvat. They are known as Dal-Um (Small Moon), Nur-Um (Great Moon) and Hol-Um (Old Moon). [[/footnote]]  the Lord in Silver, the Shining One, the Gentle Light, the Star-Slayer, the Reborn One, the Pale King, Father of Amvat, is a lunar deity,[[footnote]] When all three moons are at their fullest, Kial-Um&#39;s powers are as strong as those of other lunar deities, such as Khonsu, Selene or Avatea.  [[/footnote]]  ruler of all Amvatian moons and satellites. He is, like the Suns and the Stars, a child of the two primordial Amvatian deities. However, he was born a weak, frail individual, lacking in the strength of his siblings. As such, he was cast aside and forgotten, left without a realm or a title. For eons, he wandered the void and faced mockery from the Stars. 

However, unlike the Suns, this god is often revered and offered tributes in the form of temples, celebrations and songs. The different lunar cycles are observed by astronomers and astrologists all throughout the world, and there are numerous festivities dedicated to him. He is also the patron deity of the //Kot-Kral//, the White Sages, who specialize in magic that is most potent under the full moons.[[footnote]] The //Kot-Kral// are mostly healers, astrologists and astronomers. They are the only ones allowed to cultivate and care for the Um-Liis (&#34;Moon Flower&#34;), a variety of plant that can only survive under moonlight and has miraculous healing abilities. [[/footnote]] 

When Amvat was created, Kial-Um, then without a name of his own, saw his opportunity. While his sisters bickered and debated, the nameless god shaped from what raw materials were left three spheres. With patience, he robbed the Suns and the Stars of some of their light. With it, he imbued the spheres, making them shine and cast a dim light over the darkness of the world. This would be the testimony of his might. Satisfied, he named himself Kial-Um, and made his palace on the largest of his creations.[[footnote]] Nur-Um is the largest of all Amvatian moons and the furthest away from Amvat&#39;s surface. [[/footnote]]  

As life grew on Amvat, the Suns regained interest in the world they had created and once more set their eyes upon it, only to find Kial-Um&#39;s creations orbiting their plaything. Upon realizing what their brother had done, the Suns were furious. They called their brothers, the Stars, and showed them the light Kial-Um had stolen. Furious, the Stars attempted to seize back their light, and attacked their brother. The Cosmos shook as the Moons and the Stars went to war. However, Kial-Um had grown too powerful to defeat. He swiftly vanquished the Stars, absorbed their power and reduced them to cold, empty shells of their former selves. The Stars, now turned into minor deities of faint light, fled in fear and humiliation. 

Kial-Um chose to spare the Suns, however, for they were necessary to sustain life on Amvat. Now mightier than ever, he bargained with his sisters and reached an agreement. During the day, the Suns would rule over Amvat and do as they saw fit. During night, however, the Moons of Amvat would shine over the land. Under the cold of his father&#39;s breath, Kial-Um would watch from above, shining to further humiliate the Stars, who had returned to Duum-Nok-Nai&#39;s domains and burned with rage. Thus, day and night were given rulers and Amvat was finally complete.

+++ Terrestrial Gods

++++ The Harbingers of Strife
While the word &#34;god&#34; implies a certain degree of nobility or power, the deities known collectively as the &#34;Harbingers of Strife&#34; (Kiju-Zaah) are far from such description. The Harbingers are the deities that truly rule Amvat, and the ones responsible for the planet&#39;s hellish conditions. They do not answer prayers, they do not heed to order, and they are far from being civilized or wise. 

The Kiju-Zaah are little more than slightly clever animals, violent and vicious, acting on instinct instead of reason. The group is composed of a wide variety of deities, with different amounts of power and authority. They range from minor spirits to absolute forces of nature. There are far too many of them to be enlisted here, so this section will cover those most relevant for the //Amvatiaa//.

[[tabview]]
[[tab Jag-Lorhe]]
Jag-Lorhe (&#34;Ender of Peace&#34;), the King of Killers, the Lord of Violence, He Who Murders, the Furious One, the Red Rage, is the closest thing there is to war god on the Amvatian pantheon. War requires thought, strategy, clear objectives and organization. Jag-Lorhe lacks any such attribute, for he is a god of wanton violence and destruction.[[footnote]] Unlike other war deities, like Chiyou or Hanuman, Jag-Lorhe is a personification of senseless violence and blind rage, lacking any wisdom or strategic prowess. [[/footnote]]  

The Lord of Violence is a rabid beast, a twisted deity who seeks only to feed and kill for the sake of violence itself. As such, he favors the Korrh, who often make sacrifices unto him, which involve rituals so gruesome that I refuse to describe them here. A common myth among the Bhalli is that the King of Killers is in fact responsible for the creation of the Korrh, having helped the Desert rape the Goddess. 

This god is also the patron deity of all those Bhalli tribes that dedicate themselves to the hunting and killing of their fellows. He relishes on senseless death and suffering. His followers engage in ritual cannibalism and bathe in the blood of the ones they have killed. As such, Jag-Lorhe and his followers are feared throughout Amvat. So great is Jag-Lorh&#39;s appetite for violence that some groups sacrifice a few of their own in his name to keep him from preying on the rest of the tribe.  

Those who follow Jag-Lorhe are gifted with a sort of frenzy called //Porh-Bac// (&#34;the Crimson Lust&#34;) that makes them authentic killing machines. Whatever pain they feel only increases their rage and thus, their physical and magical might. In fact, the amount of power gained through //Porh-Bac// is such that one might die because of it. While he provides strength and fearlessness to his followers,[[footnote]] Like how berserkers are gifted by their war gods with superior strength and immunity to pain. [[/footnote]]  he has no qualms about turning them on one another, by whispering into their ears and spreading paranoia. The Ender of Peace feasts on suffering, and every soul killed in his name only fuels his power and his everlasting taste for gruesome death. 

[[/tab]]

[[tab Zihn-Kaal]]
Zihn-Kaal (&#34;He Who Hungers&#34;), the Unseen One, the Arid Monarch, the Devourer, the Wind Demon, the Lord of Famine, the Bringer of Plagues, the Insatiable, is the most powerful of the Amvatian wind deities. He is an all-consuming god, a being of unending hunger. The violent, dusty winds that scour Amvat&#39;s surface are him and his siblings hunting for their prey. They, with their thousands of tiny teeth, rip flesh from bone, slowly but surely, eventually flaying their victims alive. 

Zihn-Kaal is the one responsible for the eternal dust storms that cover Amvat, often causing whirlwinds that blot even the Suns&#39; light. He is known for ruining the crops of the Amvatian settlements with dust and sheer force of impact, leading to famine and death.[[footnote]] Some Bhalli settlements have turned to cannibalism due to famine, a behavior they find humiliating, for it is seen as a regression into the practices of the nomadic Bhalli. [[/footnote]]  He is also regarded as a harbinger of plagues and pestilences, for his breath, the Black Wind, carries a great number of toxins and sicknesses. The only way to escape the Black Wind out in the open is to seek refuge under the //Daa-Xiek//, for only their magic is strong enough to protect one against the toxic, corrosive wind.  

While still a feral entity, Zihn-Kaal is somewhat more intelligent than his brethren, having a rudimentary understanding of magic. As such, it is often difficult to keep him at bay, because he quickly learns from his mistakes and attacks in new, lethal ways. It is fortunate for the //Amvatiaa// that this god often competes for prey against the hundreds of other wind deities on the planet. This causes him to face an eternal food shortage, which weakens him, preventing the use of the Black Wind against the //Amvatiaa//.[[footnote]] Zihn-Kaal requires feeding in order to manifest in the physical world and use the Black Wind, for its usage drains him of most of his power. [[/footnote]] 

[[/tab]]

[[tab Muur-Kadev]]
Muur-Kadev (&#34;Seeder of Death&#34;), god of the desert, Lord of Dust, the Great Defiler, the Mad God, the God-Eater, Father of Monsters, the Hated Rapist, the Bastard God, the Dead One, is the epitome of brutality and barbarism amongst the Amvatian gods. His cruelty is legendary, and his power beyond any deity on Amvat. He is so cruel that some priests consider him an archdemon, rather than a god.[[footnote]] Archdemons are the most powerful inhabitants of the realms of Hell, being demons whose power rivals that of actual deities, to the point that some death gods bargain with them to keep the hordes of Hell in check. This title is also granted to those gods so cruel that they are nearly indistinguishable in behavior from real demons. [[/footnote]]  The most feared deity on the planet, Muur-Kadev and his siblings were born from the sands infused by the blood of the Stars slain by the Moon. 

From the moment he was formed, Muur-Kadev was violent and cruel, a rabid animal, a mad beast, a monster. His first act was to immediately rape his sister, the Goddess, bearing his first children, the Korrh. From that moment on, he terrorized Amvat and its inhabitants, killing anything that got in his path. Wherever he went, he killed, raped and destroyed. He devoured countless beings, having a great appetite for the Bhalli, who his sister had created from her own flesh to atone for having birthed the Korrh. He even consumed other deities and absorbed their powers, turning them into slaves of his will.

For millennia, Muur-Kadev sowed the land with suffering, king amongst the Harbingers of Strife. He sired numerous offspring besides the Korrh, all of them deities of immense cruelty and bloodthirst. The beasts that roam Amvat and prey upon the Bhalli are said to be the product of generations of interbreeding between the Mad God and the other deities that share his barbarity, reduced to a mortal form. If not for the intervention of the Goddess, who sacrificed herself to stop Muur-Kadev, the //Amvatiaa// would undoubtedly have been rendered extinct. As such, Muur-Kadev, the Great Defiler, is justly feared and hated by all. Only the Korrh, twisted and monstrous as their ancestor, worship him. 

Despite his defeat, Muur-Kadev is still a source of suffering. The desert, once his domain, still echoes his essence. In truth, Muur-Kadev, although unable to recover his form, still torments the //Amvatiaa//. Now perpetually disembodied, he roars through the hellscape that is Amvat and, together with the Suns, he remains an eternal torturer. For as long Amvat exists, the desert will reign supreme.

++++ Ib-Kubraiv
Ib-Kubraiv (&#34;the Unknown&#34; or &#34;the Stranger&#34;), the Empty One, the Shadow Upon Life, the End, the Great Maw, the One We Await, the One Who Is Imminent, is the sole death deity on Amvat. Amongst most cultures in the Multiverse, death is a subject on which much is written. All followers of a religion must know what is to become of them after they die. For the Khunn, the great goddess Unhal guides the souls of the righteous to eternal glory.[[footnote]] The Khunn are amongst the newest species to become members of the Immortal Empire, having joined on the Earth year 4582. Their home world is located on the farther edges of the Triangulum Galaxy. – S.K. [[/footnote]]  In the Juyoi religion, the Huvcall, spirit of light, indicates the path towards reincarnation.[[footnote]] One of the numerous species that comprise the Coalition of Merchant Kingdoms. – S.K. [[/footnote]]  And for the Bhinlof, the Black Hound awaits on top of Mount Hejr to judge those worthy of entering his kingdom.[[footnote]] The Bhinlof are not from Midgard, which means that Ulak must have met them while traveling a different realm. – S.K. [[/footnote]] 

With so many cultures having a vast and rich mythology regarding the Gods Below,[[footnote]] This title is given to death gods because most of their realms or afterlives occupy the lower branches and the roots of Yggdrasil. – S.K. [[/footnote]]  it is strange that the Bhalli, a people whose life expectancy is truly minuscule in comparison to most primitive races, have little to no myths regarding their sole death deity, Ib-Kubraiv.[[footnote]] I have only ever seen a handful of cases like this, most notoriously the Emerald Hegemony, whose members find the concepts of magic, deities or an afterlife to be utterly alien. [[/footnote]]  The Unknown is a deity feared not because of their cruelty, but because virtually nothing is known about their history, behavior or designs. What little is understood is that they preside over a large palace at the center of Amvat, and that all who reach it must withstand their gaze or be cast into nothingness. No criteria for their judgement are known, no agent of their will is ever mentioned,[[footnote]] Psychopomps, like Anubis, Charon and Thanatos, are found in nearly every religion and mythology. – S.K. [[/footnote]]  and no myths recording their history exist. 

In truth, I only enlist Ib-Kubraiv here because I would find it disrespectful to know of a guardian of the dead and not acknowledge their existence. Death, no matter how terrifying or unknown, must be respected, and its multiple forms,[[footnote]] Death gods are considered by some theologians to be mere manifestations of a larger, more universal concept of Death itself. – S.K. [[/footnote]]  the Gods Below, recognized as what they are: the ones who watch over us when we have departed.[[footnote]] This phrase confirms that the Uhb&#39;Seq, while long lived, are not immortal. – S.K. [[/footnote]]

++++ Inaia
With so many cruel, animalistic deities plaguing Amvat, one might ask how it is possible for life to subsist on this arid rock. The answer is a word invoked with veneration by all //Amvatiaa//: Inaia, the Goddess. Inaia is unique amongst the Amvatian pantheon, for she is a deity that brings the gift of life through water. She is worshiped, loved and elevated as the epitome of ultimate sacrifice. Raped at birth by the Desert, she nonetheless seeded life on Amvat and eventually went to war against her attacker, her own brother, in order to protect it. 

The Bhalli consider her to be the true mother of their world and themselves as a people. Her Law is held no matter the circumstances, and her most precious gift, water, treasured more than anything on the planet. It is said that the water that protrudes from Amvat&#39;s surface is, in fact, the blood of Inaia, who in her mercy and selflessness, gives part of herself to her children, so that they may thrive despite the hardships of their world. Inaia is also the only Amvatian deity to have a role as a lawgiver, for the Laws of Water are her direct words, her teachings of morality and goodwill for her children. In truth, she has given the planet a chance to develop anything resembling civilization.  

Inaia is, nonetheless, a dead goddess. When Muur-Kadev threatened to consume all life on the planet, the Goddess allowed herself to be devoured and, from within her brother&#39;s stomach, pierced his body, forming the //Naaj-Kioo// from her own blood. In this twisted embrace, she and the desert would remain forever, trapped in each other. Her sacrifice allowed life to endure, and her teachings became the backbone of most sedentary civilization. She is a goddess of compassion and kindness, a stark contrast with the violent, crazed beings that are her equals. For her actions, she is forever loved, forever remembered: a symbol of hope for all //Amvatiaa//.

++++ Other Gods
The following is a list of deities worshipped by //Amvatiaa// other than the Bhalli.   

•	Jeha Vie: The god of trade, the main figure in the pantheistic religion of the Yidh.

•	Khae Momme: &#34;The Hallowed Father,&#34; a deity worshipped exclusively by the Khae-Mok as the god of knowledge and magic. 

•	Hjia-Liiav: The Green Spirits, guardians of Viss-Mai, the village of the Silvarii.

•	Bur-Lej: The personification of magic, worshipped only in Diemnia, the Holy City.
