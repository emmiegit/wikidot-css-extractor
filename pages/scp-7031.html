**Description:** SCP-7031 is a series of frequent ontokinetic disruptions affecting the country of Australia. The risk class of these disruptions range from Notice to Critical. Whilst Foundation monitoring only began in the 1910s, retrospective research implies that SCP-7031 has been escalating since European settlement.

**BACKGROUND:** On 1/6/05, SCP-7031-1-384 teleported from Provisional Shelter-300-12-α to a party in Bali, Indonesia. It was in the presence of several functioning Scranton Reality Anchors, and measured a Hume level of 76.

**PROPOSAL:** Our lack of ability on this front poses an Amida-Critical threat, and possibly a CK-Class Restructuring Scenario. As such, Provisional Shelter-300-12-α is to be equipped with arms from Site-300-01 and Site-300-14 in order to decommission all SCP-7031-1 instances.

With the luck of a new century comes yielding convicts and steady progress. Not only do we find ourselves protecting paranormal convicts, but merchants and newborns. The progress over the last 20 years brings a tear to the eye. England shall persevere. No American independence nor Occult War shall bring it to the standards of those European slums. Thousands of convicts are under our secure care, and millions more are to come. May His Majesty&#39;s Foundation persist for centuries to come.
