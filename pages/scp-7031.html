**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7031 should never be held in an official Foundation computer, but instead remain in the hard drive of an Amiga 1000, designated SCP-7031-A. SCP-7031-A should be kept in a standard room with viewing windows on each side of the door in Site-15. The door should be made of thick steel and require clearance Level 3 to open. Near-constant surveillance is advised. Should an event occur, the appropriate FS-15 scenario must be enacted based on the event.

**Description:** SCP-7031 is a computer program written in a common programming language known as Python. When SCP-7031 is started up, the console asks for the user&#39;s name. The program then does something based on the first letter of the user&#39;s name.

It is important to note the first line of code, &#34;{{import jera}}.&#34; In Python, the keyword &#34;{{import}}&#34; looks for the specified module and &#34;imports&#34; it, allowing the program to use that file&#39;s information. However, SCP-7031 is able to use this &#34;Jera&#34; module without it existing on the hard drive[[footnote]]Any attempt to recreate the effect of SCP-7031 in another file has been unsuccessful, because the Jera module cannot be imported, installed, or read about in any Python forum.[[/footnote]]. Next, SCP-7031 seems to use the line &#34;{{if not jera.test(name): print(jera.test(name))}}&#34; to see if the user is lying about his/her name. If it detects as such, then a &#34;Take&#34; scenario occurs(read about scenarios below). If the user isn&#39;t lying, then one of four things will happen based on his/her name&#39;s first letter.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
&#34;Blaze&#34; -- SCP-7031 prints &#34;{{parentheses, EXPONENTS, MULTIPLICATION, division, ADDITION, subtraction}}&#34; and chooses a seemingly random operating device in a 100-meter diameter, chooses a random directory, and rapidly replicates every file or folder in that directory until it is stopped.

&#34;Dark&#34; -- SCP-7031 prints a riddle from J. R. R. Tolkien&#39;s &#34;The Hobbit[[footnote]]&#34;It cannot be seen, cannot be felt, cannot be heard, cannot be smelt. It lies behind stars and under hills, and empty holes it fills. It comes first and follows after, ends life, kills laughter.&#34; - Gollum, The Hobbit, J.R.R.Tolkien[[/footnote]]&#34; and sends a signal through SCP-7031-A to whatever power source it is connected to that causes the power source to shut down.

&#34;Take&#34; -- SCP-7031 prints &#34;{{60 seconds}}&#34; into the console, and the user disappears behind some form of distortion or obstruction of view after 60 seconds.

&#34;Look&#34; -- SCP-7031 prints &#34;We all need people in our lives; it&#39;s never good to be alone&#34; to the console. After that, from the time the user interacts with SCP-7031 to the end of his/her life, the user will always either have the feeling of something watching him/her or the user will see eyes peeking through darkness or around walls/pillars.

FS-15 Scenarios based on SCP-7031 incident:
//written by Doctor ████ Abrams//

FS-15-A: Blaze -- Locate the computer and directory of the replication and insert 
&#34;{{pip uninstall --target=[directory] jera --no-user}}&#34; into the console.

FS-15-B: Dark -- Personnel with clearance 3 or higher must disconnect SCP-7031-A from Site-15&#39;s main power source and reboot the affected power source directly. Use of electromagnetic pulses is not permitted under any circumstances.

FS-15-C: Take -- If possible, before the event starts, keep the victim under surveillance until he/she disappears. Record these events and consider the victim deceased.

FS-15-D: Look -- The victim must attend psychiatric therapy and record his/her experiences in a journal or text file every day.

The repeated lines of &#34;{{jera.[number]()}},&#34; seem to be lists of different letters in the English alphabet, through which SCP-7031 detects the user&#39;s first name&#39;s initial. Each list consists of a different amount of letters with no apparent correlation.

__**Addendum 7031-A: FS-15**__
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Interviewed:** Captain Simon Johnston, MTF Mu-4 (&#34;Debuggers&#34;), Designate Whiskey-11

**Interviewer:** Doctor ████ Abrams

**Foreword:** After the second major incident at Site-15 with SCP-7031, Doctor Abrams requested that Captain Johnston come up with a response to future incidents.

**&lt;Begin Log, 14:00 11/7/2001&gt;**

**Doctor Abrams:** Alright, Captain, you know protocol. State your name.

**Captain Johnston:** //Stands up// My name is Simon Wolf Johnston. I am the captain of Mobile Task Force Unit Mu-4 Designate Whiskey-11. I serve to Secure, Contain, and Protect. //Sits down//

**Doctor Abrams:** Yes, yes, thank you, Captain. So, do you have an idea regarding a response to SCP-7031 incident?

**Captain Johnston:** I do. I&#39;ve just named it Failsafe 15.

**Doctor Abrams:** Alright, let&#39;s hear it.

//Captain Johnston explains the FS-15 scenarios to Doctor Abrams//

**Doctor Abrams:** Hmm, that&#39;s an interesting idea. I&#39;ll look over it, send it to the Council for analysis, and I&#39;ll get back to you. Thank you for your time.

**Captain Johnston:** //Captain Johnston stands up.// Of course, thank you for hearing me out.

**Doctor Abrams:** //Doctor Abrams stands up.// Yes, I&#39;m always glad to help.

**&lt;End Log, 14:04&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** The appeal was sent to the 05 Council a day later, and it was approved a week after that. Captain Johnston claims he has no recollection of this interview.

__**Addendum 7031-B: Incident 7031-02**__

Doctor Abrams instructed Research Assistant Kester to perform a test on SCP-7031 with two Class-D personnel. It was against protocol to perform such a high-risk test on an object that has very little known about it. Research Assistant Kester was stripped of his title, and, appropriate amnestics applied, released to the nearby city of [REDACTED].

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
__**Test B - 27/6/2001**__
**Subjects:** D-7796, D-7797

**Procedure:** D-7796 typed her name into SCP-7031-A, and the output read &#34;False.&#34; D-7797 typed his name into the console and the output read [DATA EXPUNGED]. 

**Results:** Initially, nothing major happened when D-7796 input her name. However, after D-7797 input his name, the generator for Sector-██ of Site-15 went dark, and all communications and surveillance failed. When power returned, D-7796 was missing. Surveillance didn&#39;t pick her up anywhere else in or outside of the Site.

**Analysis:** SCP-7031 performs an action relating to the user&#39;s name, and D-7796 likely didn&#39;t put her real name.

**Author of Incident Report:** RA Collin Kester

**Incident ID:** 7031-02

**Date of Incident:** 27/6/2001

**Date of Record:** 28/6/2001

**Summary of Incident:** Subjects D-7796 and D-7797 were assisting in testing the functionalities of SCP-7031. Subject D-7796 was asked to input her name(her name was Karminn) into SCP-7031-A; SCP-7031 outputted &#34;False.&#34; The researchers all think her initials just weren&#39;t accepted, so we asked Subject D-7797 to input his name(his name is Oliver). The console outputted some stupid riddle before all the power in our wing of Site-15 completely cut out. 
Breakers weren&#39;t flipped, backup generators wouldn&#39;t work, and we couldn&#39;t do anything with the main generator, so we called in MTF Mu-4. They arrived, did something with the main generator, and the lights reappeared. One problem, though. Subject D-7796 was gone. She just disappeared. Mu-4 is investigating further into the problem, so the computer is off-site right now. Doctor Lancaster is about to interview Subject D-7797 and Doctor Abrams is supposed to talk with the captain in a few days, so I hope this thing will be fixed soon.

Doctor █████ Lancaster scheduled an interview with D-7797, the only one of the two Class-D Personnel assisting in testing SCP-7031 to survive Test B.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Interviewed:** Subject D-7797

**Interviewer:** Doctor █████ Lancaster

**Foreword:** Of the two subjects part of Test B(D-7796 and D-7797), only D-7797 seemed to survive. Due to the power outage, the Foundation was unable to record what happened to D-7796. Doctor Lancaster will ask D-7797 about what he saw.

**&lt;Begin Log, 09:31 28/6/2001&gt;**

**Doctor Lancaster:** Alright, let us get straight to the point. What did you see?

**D-7797:** Well, y&#39;know, it was super dark, so I couldn&#39;t see anything. Kary and I were like siblings, yo, so she kinda, like, grabbed onto me when the lights went out. It was scary, dude. But then somethin&#39; just yanked her away from me. She didn&#39;t even scream, I just felt her get pulled off of me. Just like that. When the lights came on, I tried to see where she was but I couldn&#39;t see her.

**Doctor Lancaster:** Peculiar. //Doctor Lancaster writes something down on a clipboard.// Was there anything else you could see? Did you feel any other presence?

**D-7797:** Nah, man, it was just the air or somethin&#39;.

**Doctor Lancaster:** Did you see anything after the lights came back on?

**D-7797:** Nah, just those army-lookin&#39; guys. //A pause. D-7797 looks like he&#39;s struggling to remember something.// Oh, wait! There was something before the lights went out!

**Doctor Lancaster:** What was it? I need to hear every detail.

**D-7797:** It was weird, man. I saw Kary put in her name, but it wasn&#39;t her name. She just wrote [DATA EXPUNGED]. I knew she was angry, but damn, yo. That&#39;s harsh. See, bro, me and her kinda had-

**Doctor Lancaster:** So, she didn&#39;t type out her real name? That&#39;s very interesting. //Doctor Lancaster writes something down onto his clipboard.// Was there anything else? Anything before that? I want to hear every detail.

**D-7797:** We had a fight cuz she was pissed about somethin&#39; I said. [DATA EXPUNGED]. It hurt, man.

**Doctor Lancaster:** What did you say to her?

**D-7797:** She was tellin&#39; me about a dream she had and that she thought it felt super real. I told her it was crap and to just forget about it.

//Doctor Lancaster raises an eyebrow.//

**Doctor Lancaster:** A dream? About what, exactly?

**D-7797:** I didn&#39;t hear a lot, but she said it just had a bunch of creepy stuff. Guns and monsters. You were in it, too.

**Doctor Lancaster:** //Doctor Lancaster writes more into his clipboard. He looks excited.// Anything else?

**D-7797:** Nope.

**Doctor Lancaster:** Alright, this is great. Thank you for your cooperation. You are dismissed.

**&lt;End Log, 9:38&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** D-7796 did not type her name into SCP-7031-A as instructed. Before Test B, D-7796 had a dream that contained &#34;Guns and monsters. [Doctor Lancaster was] in it too.&#34; Foundation agents are currently discussing what this dream meant, as it is likely related to [[[SCP-990|SCP-990]]].
