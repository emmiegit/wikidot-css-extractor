    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-3085-ARC

**Object Class:** Neutralized (Formerly Keter)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3085 is currently held in Site-55&#39;s Humanoid Containment Wing. Medically trained personnel are to clean, change, and re-apply the entity&#39;s EGD tube, a type of feeding tube.[[footnote]]Esophagogastroduodenoscopy tube[[/footnote]] every day on first shift change. General anesthetics are to be administered every 5 hours to keep the entity in a comatose state.

In the event SCP-3085 wakes up, researchers in observation are to restrain and administer tranquilizers as needed until SCP-3085 is subdued. 

**Description:** SCP-3085 is an approximately 90-year-old Hispanic male with short white hair, tan skin, and a birthmark under its left eye; currently suffering from Stage 7 Alzheimer&#39;s disease. When conscious, the entity displays symptoms of extreme regression; having lost the ability to swallow and speak, and responds with fear towards personnel it has known for over 40 years.

SCP-3085 is a Class 4 reality bender, capable of altering its appearance and its immediate area. Though the entity was capable of controlling its abilities earlier in its life, its age and mental health have rendered it unable to do so reliably. For its safety and the safety of Foundation personnel, Containment Specialist Rivers has deemed it imperative for SCP-3085 to be placed in a medically induced coma. 

On ██/██/2017, the entity disappeared from its containment chamber. Video surveillance of the chamber shows SCP-3085 jolting up in its bed and contorting as if in pain. A black orb manifested before the entity, which grew visibly calm before reaching out to the orb. SCP-3085 proceeded to slowly be absorbed by the orb until the entity completely disappeared.

Further information regarding SCP-3085 and its history with the Foundation is available in the accompanying files.

**Interviewer:** Dr. Erikson

**Interviewed:** SCP-3085

**Foreword:** SCP-3085 was undergoing a “lucid moment”[[footnote]]A lucid moment refers to a period in which a sufferer of Alzheimer&#39;s disease becomes aware of themselves and their surroundings.[[/footnote]]. They seemed to be conscious and several of their symptoms had regressed. Researchers decided that this was an ideal time to speak to SCP-3085. 

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Dr. Erikson:** Hello, SCP-3085. How are you today?

//(SCP-3085 is silent)//

**Dr. Erikson:** SCP-3085?

//(SCP-3085’s breathing becomes agitated. Shapes appear in the air and the structure of the room begins to shift.)//

**Dr. Erikson:** SCP-3085, it&#39;s me.

**SCP-3085:** //(Faintly)// Please…

//(The shapes become more vivid and the room changes drastically. SCP-3085 appears less visible.)//

**Dr. Erikson:** It’s me, Dr. Erikson.

**SCP-3085:** (Faintly) Bill?

**Dr. Erikson:** That’s right. It’s Bill. Stay calm. I’m here.

//(Anomalous activity slows.)//

**Dr. Erikson:** Stay with me.

//(SCP-3085 gasps. Anomalous activity stops.)//

**Dr. Erikson:** That’s it. It’s OK. It’s OK.

**SCP-3085:** //(Inaudible)//

**Dr. Erikson:** What was that?

**SCP-3085:** //(Faintly)// It… hurts. It hurts so much.

**Dr. Erikson:** I ca-

//(SCP-3085 starts violently coughing)//

**Dr. Erikson:** Do you need medical attention?

**SCP-3085:** No!

//(The lightbulbs of the containment cell shatter. )//

**SCP-3085:** No… No doctors.

//(Pause)//

**Dr. Erikson:** What can I do for you today, SCP-3085?

**SCP-3085:** You have to- You have to kill me.

**Dr. Erikson:** (Pauses) I… I can’t do that, SCP-3085.

**SCP-3085:** Please Bill, I- You… I can’t live like this.

**Dr. Erikson:** SCP-3085… You’re agitated. Why don’t you calm down and then we can-

**SCP-3085:** No. I have to do this now. I’ve been lucky, most of my kind don’t live this long but…
I have. I’m aging, all of me. I can feel it, I can feel myself losing my mind. Do you have any idea what that feels like? To watch yourself go insane?

**Dr. Erikson:** N-no, I-

**SCP-3085:** It’s the scariest thing in the fucking world. I’m losing myself, Bill, and I&#39;m losing control. My powers have always been a curse and- (Pause)

**Dr. Erikson:** SCP-3085?

**SCP-3085:** I’m terrified of what happens when I lose control. Bill, I need you to understand. These moments of lucidity aren’t an alleviation, they’re just more pain. You’ve seen it. I’m losing control of my powers. My existence is pain and it needs to end. Please, Doctor. I’m begging you. If you don’t, I’ll fucking do it myself.

**Dr. Erikson:** Raul, I’m… I’m sorry.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Dr. Erikson&#39;s Proposal&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
&gt; I have worked with SCP-3085 longer than anyone in Site-55, and longer than anyone in the Foundation. Of the almost 70 years he has been here, I have worked with him for 40.
&gt; 
&gt; The reason I bring this to the committee&#39;s attention is that he spoke to me. In a brief moment of lucidity, he recognized me and begged me to kill him before I applied the anesthetics. He looked me dead in the eye and begged me, as a friend, to kill him, and told me that if I didn&#39;t kill him, he would do it himself the next time he could.
&gt; 
&gt; I have sat on that moment for weeks. I, who treated him strictly, following the rules of interaction laid out by the Foundation, was considered a friend by SCP-3085. I, who never called him by anything other than SCP-3085, was a friend to him. This is a man at the end of his life who can no longer control the curse he did not ask for. I ask you, what use is there in keeping him alive? What research is there left to be done on this man?
&gt; Can you imagine the sheer terror he must be living in when he&#39;s lucid? Absolute power and control, a mere thought away, and yet he can&#39;t &#39;fix&#39; himself because he doesn&#39;t know what the hell is happening? We let it get to this. We could have spared him this suffering. Were it me in those conditions I would have asked to be killed too, as I am sure you all would too.
&gt; 
&gt; I know this is not written in the standards you folks want, and I am prepared to face whatever repercussions come from this.
&gt; I&#39;m not writing to the Ethics Committee as Doctor Erikson, I am writing to you as Bill.
&gt; Please, I beg of you.
&gt; Let Raul Lopera, or as you call him, SCP-3085, die.
&gt; 
&gt; - Dr. William R. Erikson
&gt; SCP-3085 Lead Senior Researcher

&gt; Notice from The Ethics Committee
&gt; Dr. Erkison&#39;s proposal has been denied. Furthermore, Dr. Erikson has been reassigned.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Incident Report&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]
Date: ██/██/2016
Involved Personnel: Dr. Amara, Dr. Nuñez, Dr. Bellus
Report: Doctors Amara, Nuñez, and Bellus entered SCP-3085&#39;s containment chamber to perform routine examinations and a memory test. All three present personnel had over ten years of experience working with SCP-3085 and had conducted a cumulative 90 examinations between them. SCP-3085&#39;s mental state seemed to be further regressed than normal and was behaving erratically.

Dr. Bellus attempted to gain the entity&#39;s attention and made physical contact with the entity, which startled it. SCP-3085 screamed in fear, causing a site-wide power loss. Backup generators came online within 30 seconds of the incident. What happened in the intermittent time frame is unknown.

When video feed of the entity&#39;s room was re-established, Doctors Amara, Nuñez, and Bellus had vanished and SCP-3085 levitated in the center of the room with a stream of images projecting on the walls around it. The images were noted as depicting Site-55, the faces of researchers and personnel who have worked with SCP-3085, and unidentified locations.

The entity continued to scream for one minute before passing out and falling to the ground. A re-containment team administered general anesthetics as per the orders of Containment Specialist Rivers. Containment Specialist Rivers has submitted a proposal to the Ethics Committee to update SCP-3085&#39;s Special Containment Procedures to keep the entity in a comatose state.

&gt; ++++ Notice from The Ethics Committee
&gt; Containment Specialist River&#39;s proposal has been approved.
