++++ **__Special Containment Procedures__**
SCP-5601 will remain in its original cage, held within Standard Containment Chamber 7 at Site-51. SCP-5601 does not require the standard maintenance and care typical of its species and all contact with it should be limited to approved testing and/or interviews.

Under no circumstance is the seal on its cage to be broken, nor any attempt made to breach the confines therein. All personnel attempting to do so will be considered compromised and immediately re-designated E-Class Personnel; exorcism and/or long-term amnestic treatment of comprised individuals may be required.

Interaction with SCP-5601 is restricted to members of the Site-51 Thaumaturgy Department&#39;s Demonology team. Standard Marquis-Class protocols are to be in effect while transporting, interviewing, and/or testing SCP-5601. All inquiries into information ascertained through SCP-5601 must be approved by the Information Security Administration.

&gt;
SCP-5601 is a Marquis-Class Demonic Entity[[footnote]]According to the Glymen Demonology Index, Marquis-Class Demonic entities are mid-tier extra-spatial entities with various anomalous capabilities. Notably common abilities include telekinesis, divination, perception manipulation, and host possession. Marquis-Class entities are typically in control of large groups of lower-class demonic entities, known as legions.[[/footnote]] currently anchored to a grey parrot (//Psittacus erithacus//).  SCP-5601 self-identifies by the name &#34;Phenex&#34;; this title is further corroborated by the sigil used in the binding process. Fluent in both English and Latin, SCP-5601 is capable of perfectly emulating human speech. MRI tests indicate a restructuring of the syrinx and voice box to allow for proper speech, despite its current host originally lacking the physical requirements to do so. SCP-5601 has a small iron band attached to its left leg. The runes and lattices found on the band function as a second binding agent, preventing SCP-5601 from utilizing the full range of its abilities. 
&gt;

    width=100px
]]
&gt;
SCP-5601 is locked within a thaumically sealed iron birdcage. The iron used has been pressure treated with sodium chloride, further dampening any of SCP-5601&#39;s latent telekinetic abilities. Due to the cage lacking any door or entry mechanism, it is theorized that SCP-5601&#39;s host was present within the cage prior to the binding process. Engraved on the bottom of the cage is the Sigil of Phenex[[footnote]]Notably found in The Lesser Key of Solomon&#39;s Ars Goetia, the Necronomicon, and several other tomes of occult academia.   [[/footnote]], along with several sealing lattices and runes of various origins. A repulsion lattice has been etched along the central bar of the cage; it is noticeably newer than the rest of the engravings. This lattice is specifically used to repel other demonic entities from directly interacting with the cage.

++++ **__Discovery__**
On 2020/06/05, SCP-5601 was recovered by Deputy Sheriff Kyle White within an abandoned cabin in Bland County, Virginia. SCP-5601 was found with the skeletal remains of a middle-aged human male. The remains show signs of trauma consistent with long-term torture. The cabin was in a severe state of disrepair, though a small amount of evidence was able to be collected. This evidence was mostly occult in nature and has not been useful in identifying the remains. Deputy White&#39;s report included testimony stating the parrot knew detailed information about his and his wife&#39;s personal life. This testimony, evidence, as well as the inscriptions depicted in photos of the cage led to Foundation WebCrawler-77P30 flagging the file for investigation.

After recovering SCP-5601, all involved individuals were amnestisized and all evidence was subsequently confiscated or destroyed. The following video of SCP-5601 was recovered from Deputy Howard Stanley&#39;s personal cell phone.

**[BEGIN LOG]**

//[Deputy White is standing in front of SCP-5601.]//

**White:** You recording, Stanley? 

**Stanley:** Yeah, yeah go.

**White:** Say it again, little guy. Who am I?

**SCP-5601:** A simple task, with simple delight. A simple man, that Kyle White.

**Stanley:** Holy shit!

**White:** I&#39;m tellin&#39; ya&#39; man, it&#39;s like he knew my name right off the bat.

**Stanley:** No way, you had to coach him before.

**SCP-5601:** I will tell you, that it’s a fact. I know quite more, than this or that. I know what you do, behind closed door. But embarrass you, if I say more.

**White:** Wait, what are you–

**Stanley:** Shhhh! I wanna get this.

//[The camera zooms in further on SCP-5601]//

**Stanley:** Go ahead little man, keep going.

**SCP-5601:** To tell you more, a simple task. You pray do tell, some more you ask. Mr. White and wife, sleep with thy neighbor. For a noble man, such naughty behavior. Tied up and spanked, him and wife. Such a simple man, with a simple life.

//[Deputy Stanley begins laughing.]//

**White:** No, that&#39;s not– give me that!

//[Deputy White&#39;s hand is seen approaching the camera.]//

++++ **__Breach Event__**
After a week of refusing to cooperate, SCP-5601 agreed to an interview. Interrogation specialist Dr. Daniel O&#39;Brien was chosen for this assignment and was scheduled to arrive two days later. The interview took place on 2020/06/14, the following is a transcription of the event.

[[collapsible show=&#34;● Interview SCP-5601 ●&#34; hide=&#34;○ Interview SCP-5601 ○&#34;]]
**[BEGIN LOG]**

//[SCP-5601 is placed on a table in front of Dr. O&#39;Brien, it is emulating the song of the Mourning Bird. Dr. O&#39;Brien clears his throat before he begins to speak.]//

**Dr. O&#39;Brien:** Hello SCP-5601, my name is Doct–

**SCP-5601:** An exchange of words for me to reply in. Is that not why you have come, Daniel O&#39;Brien?

//[SCP-5601&#39;s voice is quiet and child-like, it tilts its head waiting for Dr. O&#39;Brien&#39;s reply.]//

**Dr. O&#39;Brien:** I&#39;m sure you impress many people with that little trick– I, however, am not one of them. I&#39;d like to begin. 

**SCP-5601:** Very well, ask your questions. I will provide, your favored lessons.

**Dr. O&#39;Brien:** Let&#39;s start with, how did you end up in this cage?

**SCP-5601:**  Was summoned of course, the only way. From the deepest depths, to the light of day.

**Dr. O&#39;Brien:** Can you cut the rhyming shit out! I&#39;m sorry, but can you just speak clearly.

**SCP-5601:** You ask of me, speak words clearer. I say no, talk to a mirror. Ask your questions, don&#39;t be uncouth. And when it is done, we&#39;ll both know the truth. 

**Dr. O&#39;Brien:** Right... So, we found skeletal remains in the bunker we recovered you in. Were those the remains of the one who summoned you?

**SCP-5601:** A pompous trickster, nothing more. Locked me away, not even a door. He toiled and prodded, much the same. Until the day, my enemies came.

**Dr. O&#39;Brien:** &#34;A pompous trickster.&#34; He was able to summon and bind you. Surely he was more capable than you&#39;re letting on.

**SCP-5601:**  He called; I came– simple transaction. Dire situation, an impulsive reaction.

**Dr. O&#39;Brien:** Whose dire situation?

**SCP-5601:** My own sadly failed attempt. For power wished, for power kept. A move I made, for an [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5208 empty throne]. To my dismay, t’was not alone. Twenty legions, marched on the son. Twenty legions fell one-by-one. Broken, beaten, locked in a cage. A distant voice, I heard that day. He called; I came– desperate escape. He called, I came and sealed my fate.

**Dr. O&#39;Brien:** Twenty Legions? Sounds like you had quite the following. Why haven&#39;t you attempted to escape, to rally your forces? Dating on the skeleton shows you had almost 10 years before we found you.

**SCP-5601:** To stay I must, I cannot lie. If I return, I&#39;d surely die. What was once mine, is no more. Locked in a cage, not even a door.

**Dr. O&#39;Brien:** Hiding in a bird, bent to the whims of a common trickster. All just to hide from your enemies. Sounds a bit cowardly doesn&#39;t it?  

//[SCP-5601 remains silent as Dr. O&#39;Brien laughs.]//

**Dr. O&#39;Brien:** Oh, no more silly rhymes? No witty dispute? The great Phenex, Master of None, Keeper of the Cage. Fitting titles for such a fool!

**SCP-5601:** So far from home, my displaced friend. You&#39;ve come for me, yet met your end.

**Dr. O&#39;Brien:** Are you going to rhyme me to death? Or, is the //mighty// Phenex going to peck me asunder? Quit your squawking and accept it, you&#39;re coming home.

**SCP-5601:** A lowly footman, with so much bluster. But lack the nut, you could not muster. 

**Dr. O&#39;Brien:** How dare you– I&#39;ll show you what I can muster!

//[Dr. O&#39;Brien stands abruptly, knocking over his chair. SCP-5601 begins to squawk and flap its wings erratically.]//
 
**Dr. O&#39;Brien:** All hail Andras! 

//[As Dr. O&#39;Brien grabs the cage the video feed distorts, a bright light emanates from it. After the video feed restores, SCP-5601 can be seen unharmed in its cage and Dr. O&#39;Brien laying the floor smoldering.]//

Through autopsy, the &#34;Dr. O&#39;Brien&#34; present during this interview was revealed to be a [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5049 homunculus][[footnote]]Artificially created humanoid vessel.[[/footnote]]. The real Dr. O&#39;Brien&#39;s body was recovered several hours later, dead in the trunk of his car. The Foundation has since developed methods of detecting homunculi and subsequently stopped two additional attempts to recover SCP-5601. 

To show its gratitude for the protection given by the Foundation, SCP-5601 has agreed to cooperate and assist the Demonology Team. The information gathered from SCP-5601 has been invaluable in understanding demonic sociology, thaumaturgy, and other occult studies.
