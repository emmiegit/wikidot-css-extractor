Item #: SCP-6512     picture:none

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: there is still much research that must be done in order to figure out where to find SCP 6512 and or contain it.

Description: SCP-6512 or &#34;gloom&#34; are located in japan and have been reported to have been seen at night many times. Most of the people who have come face to face with the entity have committed suicide, our suspicion is that this entity has the ability to alter people&#39;s perceptions of their surroundings but due to how rare it is for them to be found at night let alone at the day we don&#39;t have enough evidence surrounding them.

SCP-6512 resembles human shadows in different heights shapes and sizes but what makes SCP-6512 distinct from a regular human shadow is its eyes. these eyes vary in amount by 2 to 36 as we have seen from many tv footages we were able to salvage all over japan.


Note: this entity is very unknown meaning we will have to conduct more research on this creature in order to see if it&#39;s dangerous and how we can contain it.
