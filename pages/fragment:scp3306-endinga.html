&gt; **[Begin Log]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dalton:** Okay, everyone. Before you all vote me out, I&#39;d just like to say that, no matter how terrible this experience has been, I&#39;m really glad I met all of you. I mean that. I know you have to vote for someone, and I know that I haven&#39;t been the greatest person to be stuck on a merry-go-round with—
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Craig.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dalton:** Yeah?
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** I&#39;m voting for Shelley.
&gt; 
&gt; **Long:** Luke! Really?
&gt; 
&gt; **Ashcombe:** Fine by me. Bitch. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Simmons:** Hey, Ash-hole. Shut up. Luke, why are you voting for Shelley?
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** This whole thing is a game, right? One big, sadistic game. But it&#39;s so //long//. We spend most of our time watching TV. Yeah, being trapped on a carousel was hellishly uncomfortable for the first couple of decades, but we&#39;ve basically gotten used to it by now. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirkwood:** Speak for yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Obviously it&#39;s not //great//, but it&#39;s gotten easier with time. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Long:** Sorry, but what&#39;s this got to do with me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** I&#39;ve been watching you. Granted, I&#39;ve been watching //all// of you, but you&#39;re different, Shelley. You&#39;re not just bored. You&#39;re waiting for something, aren&#39;t you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Simmons:** Wait, you&#39;re basing this whole speech on a hunch?
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Come on. I&#39;m sure you guys have felt it from her, too. There&#39;s something &#39;off&#39; about her whole demeanor. She&#39;s more impatient than scared. She&#39;s gotten more and more detached as the game&#39;s gone on. She&#39;s bored with her own game.
&gt; 
&gt; **Simmons:** She&#39;s depressed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirkwood:** We&#39;re //all// depressed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Long:** Look, if you&#39;re going to vote for me, just vote for me. I don&#39;t want to hear all this. Just end it, please.
&gt; 
&gt; [11 seconds of silence.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dalton:** Okay, good enough for me. I vote Shelley.
&gt; 
&gt; **Simmons:** I vote Hughes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ashcombe:** (//Gesturing toward Dalton//) The fairy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dalton:** Shelley. Sorry. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Kirkwood:** I vote Jesus.
&gt; 
&gt; **Long:** Hmm. I guess it doesn&#39;t matter who I vote for, does it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Looks like it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Long:** Well, that settles it. Thank God. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dalton:** Wait—
&gt; 
&gt; **Long:** You know, it was fun at first, but it&#39;s really gone on far too long.
&gt; 
&gt; **Simmons:** Holy shit. No way.
&gt; 
&gt; **Long:** Thank you all for being my test group. I daresay things are going to be different the next time around.
&gt; 
&gt; **[End Log]**

**Afterword:** Following this, 3306-POI-33 vanished and SCP-3306 ceased all anomalous activity. The five remaining 3306-POI subjects were placed under quarantine. Initial observation has shown that subjects appear to have regained normal biological functions.

Several days later, a new instance of SCP-3306 carrying 25 new persons of interest was discovered in the Far Northern Rockies. Updates to SCP-3306&#39;s documentation are underway.
