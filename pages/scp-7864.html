**Item #:** SCP-7864

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7864 is to be stored in a standard secure locker at Site-19. Access to SCP-7864 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above, and any testing must be approved by at least two Level 3 researchers. SCP-7864 is to be kept in a non-metallic container with a lock that requires a six-digit code to open. This code is to be changed weekly.

All personnel interacting with SCP-7864 must be equipped with noise-cancelling headphones and communication is to be conducted via written notes or digital text. Any audio recording devices are strictly prohibited in SCP-7864&#39;s containment area. Following exposure to SCP-7864 individuals are to be monitored for a minimum of 48 hours and undergo a psychological evaluation before returning to regular duties.

**Description:** SCP-7864 appears to be a standard wristwatch of an unknown brand with a leather strap and a metallic dial. The item displays no anomalous properties when not worn. However, upon being worn on a person&#39;s wrist, SCP-7864 activates its anomalous effects.

The primary anomalous effect of SCP-7864 is the alteration of the wearer&#39;s speech patterns. Words and phrases spoken by the individual wearing SCP-7864 are perceived as highly offensive, inappropriate, or disturbing by anyone who hears them, regardless of the actual content of the speech. This effect does not extend to written communication.

The effect of SCP-7864 is immediate and does not require the listener to understand the language spoken by the wearer. Recordings of the wearer&#39;s speech do not carry the anomalous effect, which suggests the effect is linked to the act of live speaking while SCP-7864 is worn.

Additional testing has revealed that the effect has a radius of approximately 10 meters from the wearer. Individuals within this radius report feelings of anger, disgust, or anxiety upon hearing the wearer speak, often leading to aggressive confrontations or distress. The effect dissipates rapidly once the listener leaves the radius or the watch is removed.

**Addendum 7864-1:** SCP-7864 was recovered from a pawn shop in ██████, after multiple reports of public disturbances and unexplained aggressive behavior in the area. The shop owner was unaware of the item&#39;s anomalous properties.

**Addendum 7864-2:** Incident Report 7864-2A

During a routine test, Researcher ████ accidentally wore SCP-7864 outside the testing area, resulting in a site-wide disturbance. The situation was contained, but not before multiple altercations and two instances of temporary psychological trauma among staff. This incident led to the current containment procedures.

**Addendum 7864-3:** Research Note

&#34;It appears that SCP-7864&#39;s effect is not limited to offensive language. In a recent test, subjects reported feeling insulted even by neutral or positive statements. The mechanism behind this alteration of perception remains unclear. Further research is necessary to understand whether SCP-7864 affects the speech directly or alters the listener&#39;s perception.&#34; - Dr. ██████</textarea></pre>
