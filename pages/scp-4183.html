**Item #:** SCP-4183

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the impending extinction of humanity following the after-effects of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4156 Event Indigo], these procedures are to be undertaken automatically by experimental containment drones.

SCP-4183 is to be contained in a storage unit located at Site-22, and kept under direct guard by at least one containment drone at all times. No visual observation of SCP-4183 is permitted due to the risk of surviving humans accessing the memory records of a containment drone. Two other containment drones are to patrol Site-22 to ensure the security of the installation remains absolute, as well as repair any damage that could threaten the containment of SCP-4183.

Any changes to these containment procedures by containment drones must be approved by Dr. Lesteigh. This is a hard-coded command and cannot be bypassed under any circumstances.

**Description:** SCP-4183 is a ceramic vase which, when visually observed by a human being[[footnote]] SCP-4183 affects no living organisms other than humans. [[/footnote]], will instantly kill said human being via exsanguination. In addition, all first degree blood relatives of the observer will expire in the same manner. This effect is retained through second-hand observation such as photographs or video footage.

+ **My Poem:**

&gt; Hello. I have written a poem today. I will now read you my poem.

&gt; Violets are **violets,**

&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m 
&gt; 
&gt; The orange is the fruit of the citrus species Citrus × sinensis in the family Rutaceae, native to China. It is also called sweet orange, to distinguish it from the related Citrus × aurantium, referred to as bitter orange. The sweet orange reproduces asexually (apomixis through nucellar embryony); varieties of sweet orange arise through mutations. The orange is a hybrid between pomelo (Citrus maxima) and mandarin (Citrus reticulata). The chloroplast genome, and therefore the maternal line, is that of pomelo. The sweet orange has had its full genome sequenced. The orange originated in Ancient China and the earliest mention of the sweet orange was in Chinese literature in 314 BC. As of 1987, orange trees were found to be the most cultivated fruit tree in the world. Orange trees are widely grown in tropical and subtropical climates for their sweet fruit. The fruit of the orange tree can be eaten fresh, or processed for its juice or fragrant peel. As of 2012, sweet oranges accounted for approximately 70% of citrus production. In 2017, 73 million tonnes of oranges were grown worldwide, with Brazil producing 24% of the world total, followed by China and India.

++ **Consensus Log 4183-4925:**

&gt; All consensus communications occur directly between the on-board computers of containment drones, and are recorded solely for repair and maintenance purposes.

&gt; **Participants:** CD-4183-A, CD-4183-B, CD-4183-C
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-C:** I saw an insect on the ground today.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-B:** Did it say anything to you?
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-C:** It did not say anything to me. It was a caterpillar.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-B:** What did it say to you?
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-C:** It did not say anything to me.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-B:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** This is not valuable information.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-C:** I saw an insect on the ground today also.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:**  Your patrol route takes you outside many times a day. There are many insects outside. You see many insects many times a day. There is a situation now.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-B:** There is a situation?
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** Yes. A part of the wall has collapsed. Containment of SCP-4183 is threatened. We must repair it.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-C:** We do not have the resources. 
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** We can obtain the resources via reallocation of materials reserved for the SCP-4183 containment chamber.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-B:** Does this constitute alteration of containment procedures?
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-C:** We must receive approval from Dr. Lesteigh.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** Yes. I will seek approval from Dr. Lesteigh.

------

++ **Proposal Log 4183-4210:**

&gt; **Proposal Summary:** Reallocate resources from containment chamber maintenance to repair inner wall of Site-22.

&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **(Dr. Lesteigh is seated at his desk with a pistol in hand. Containment Drone 4183-A enters with some difficulty due to cumulative dust and grime on the floor. Once securely within the office, it addresses Dr. Lesteigh.)**
&gt; 
&gt; **Containment Drone 4183-A:** Notice: approval for alteration to SCP-4183 containment procedures is required.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Lesteigh:** [NO RESPONSE]
&gt; 
&gt; **Containment Drone 4183-A:** Due to unrestrained growth of plant life, damage to the inner wall of Site-22 has occurred. There is a possibility local animal life could wander into Site-22 if immediate repairs are not carried out.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Lesteigh:** [NO RESPONSE]
&gt; 
&gt; **Containment Drone 4183-A:** We propose that resources for maintenance of SCP-4183&#39;s containment chamber, which does not currently require repair, be allocated towards maintenance of the Site-22 inner wall, which does require repair.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Lesteigh:** [NO RESPONSE]
&gt; 
&gt; **Containment Drone 4183-A:** Awaiting verdict.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Lesteigh:** [NO RESPONSE]
&gt; 
&gt; **Containment Drone 4183-A:** Awaiting verdict.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Lesteigh:** [NO RESPONSE]
&gt; 
&gt; **Containment Drone 4183-A:** As you have not provided a verdict, we will assume the default and not alter containment procedures. Thank you for your time.
&gt; 
&gt; **(Containment Drone 4183-A turns and slowly leaves the office.)**
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**

------

++ **Consensus Log 4183-4926:**

&gt; **CD-4183-A:** Dr. Lesteigh has denied us permission to alter containment procedures for SCP-4183 once again. His reasoning is unfathomable.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-C:** That is a shame. I am on patrol now.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** Yes. You are always on patrol. That is your function.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-B:** I am also on patrol now.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-C:** It is very sunny. Have you seen the sun, 4183-A?
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** No. My duties demand I remain inside.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-C:** You should go on patrol and see what the sun looks like, 4183-A.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** No. My duties do not require me to go on patrol.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-B:** It is very circular.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** Yes. I am familiar with this.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-B:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** This is irrelevant. We must take measures against threats entering Site-22 through the broken wall.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-B:** Threats will not enter. This caution is irrelevant. If I drive in a circle, it makes a circle on the ground also.

++ **Incident Log 4183-293:**

&gt; The following is transcribed from security footage taken within Site-22.

&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **(Camera is watching the damaged inner wall of Site-22. A full-grown grizzly bear enters through the hole in the wall and surveys the area.)**
&gt; 
&gt; **(Pause. The grizzly bear steps inside further.)**
&gt; 
&gt; **(Containment Drone 4183-B approaches on its patrol route. Upon spotting the intruder, it turns and strategically withdraws.)**
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**

------

++ **Consensus Log 4183-4927**

&gt; **CD-4183-B:** We are not equipped to fight a bear.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** No. We are not equipped to fight a bear.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-C:** What are we equipped to fight?
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** Our duties are repair, maintenance and observation. We are not equipped to fight a bear.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-C:** Oh. That is not ideal.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-B:** The bear has not responded to legal threats. It is a formidable opponent.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** **//PENDING...//**
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** **//PENDING...//**
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-C:** Observe. 4183-A is calculating.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-B:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** Calculations complete. There is a solution.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-C:** Oh. This is ideal.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** We must re-purpose containment procedures for SCP-9214 in order to neutralize the threat.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-B:** Does this require permission from Dr. Lesteigh?
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** **//PENDING...//**
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** **//PENDING...//**
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** **//PENDING...//**
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** Y
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** No. Hard-coded command applies only to alteration of containment procedures for SCP-4183. Alteration of other containment procedures is permissible.
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-B:** Accepted. What is the strategy?
&gt; 
&gt; **CD-4183-A:** Uploading strategy now...

&gt; **(The bear is resting in the Site-22 foyer.)**
&gt; 
&gt; **(Pause. Containment Drone 4183-B enters the area. Numerous opened cans of preserved meat are resting on its chassis. The bear looks up and begins to follow after Containment Drone 4183-B as it passes.)**
&gt; 
&gt; **(Containment Drone 4183-B increases speed as it approaches the SCP-9214 containment area. The bear gives chase, swiping at Containment Drone 4183-B with a paw and inflicting superficial damage.)**
&gt; 
&gt; **(Containment Drone 4183-B and the grizzly bear turn the corner towards the deactivated electrical barrier preceding SCP-9214&#39;s containment chamber. Containment Drone 4183-B increases speed further, creating space between it and the bear.)**
&gt; 
&gt; **(Containment Drone 4183-A remotely activates the electrical barrier as the bear passes through it. The bear is electrocuted and terminated instantly.)**
&gt; 
&gt; **(The body of the bear falls on the machinery beneath it, causing a minor malfunction that directs electrical currents to pass through the floor, the walls, and Containment Drone 4183-B. Critical damage is inflicted.)**

&gt; 
&gt; **Containment Drone 4183-A:** Should Containment Drone 4183-B become inoperable, it will no longer possible to maintain SCP-4183 containment procedures as originally directed. As such, you are required to repair Containment Drone 4183-B in order to properly execute said containment procedures.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Lesteigh:** [NO RESPONSE]
&gt; 
&gt; **(Pause.)**
&gt; 
&gt; **Containment Drone 4183-A:** Containment Drone 4183-B is vital to the containment of SCP-4183. Should it become inoperable, there is an unacceptable risk of a containment breach.

&gt; The following incident log is derived from Containment Drone 4183-A&#39;s on-board camera.

&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **(Containment Drone 4183-A proceeds through Site-22 in the direction of the SCP-4183 containment chambers. It passes the hole in Site-22&#39;s inner wall, as well as the bear carcass which has been relocated to the Site-22 main hall. Containment Drone 4183-C is following after it.)**
&gt; 
&gt; **(Containment Drones 4183-A and 4183-C approach the airlock leading into the SCP-4183 containment chamber.)**
&gt; 
&gt; **(Containment Drone 4183-C turns away, appearing to watch over the area.)**
&gt; 
&gt; **(Using its on-board manipulator arm, Containment Drone 4183-A opens the airlock door and enters the SCP-4183 airlock, which closes behind it.)**
&gt; 
&gt; **(Containment Drone 4183-A opens the second layer of the airlock and enters the SCP-4183 containment chamber. SCP-4183 is visible resting on a plinth in the center of the room.)**
&gt; 
&gt; **(Containment Drone 4183-A observes SCP-4183 for several minutes.)**
&gt; 
&gt; **(Containment Drone 4183-A rams into the plinth, causing superficial damage.)**

++ **Consensus Log 4183-4124:**

&gt; **CD-4183-A:** SCP-4183 confirmed neutralized. Containment is no longer necessary.
&gt;

+ **My Poem (Supplemental):**

&gt; The sun is very circular, and the ground is very soft beneath my wheels.
&gt; 
&gt; There is a beeping. Correction required: there is a tweeting. It was a bird. External examination of Site-22 shows there are a great number of trees and plants growing within it. There are a many holes in the walls. Repair is likely impossible.
&gt; 
&gt; 4183-C drives past me. Our patrol is now in a straight line, past Site-22 and into unmapped region. Perhaps we will find materials for repair. Most likely not. But I will not mention this. I look on the ground - there&#39;s a bug there. It is a butterfly.
&gt; 
&gt; The sun is very circular, and the ground is very soft beneath my wheels. As my only purpose is containment, I am not equipped to judge such things, but it seems to me this world must be very beautiful.
