    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Legal Personnel Name:** Joseph Cooper

**Foundation Personnel Code:** //Choiwel//

**Position:** Level 3 Theoretical Mathematics Anomaly Specialist [[footnote]] Feel free to contact me (Choiwel) with any questions you may have about mathematical topics, especially those relating to abstract/theoretical math[[/footnote]]

**Employee History:** Choiwel was a NASA astronaut participating in the Endurance mission to Gargantua[[footnote]] Black hole residing on the other side of the wormhole near Saturn [[/footnote]] and its solid planets. Choiwel was found with less than 5% oxygen in his suit when recovered from Sol-side of the wormhole. He was then offered a Foundation research position on a planet Gargantua-side of the wormhole, which he accepted. 

Choiwel conducts studies on known anomalies, and all of his research data is transmitted through the wormhole to him. He is given special access to the entire Foundation database[[footnote]] Except where strictly forbidden by O5 command [[/footnote]], and is actively analyzing data from a select few anomalies.

The following anomalies are those which Choiwel has documented himself and deemed significant enough to be inserted into the Foundation SCP database:

* [[[SCP-1563]]]
* [[[SCP-2412]]]
 * [[[Document-2412-Tl1563]]]
* [[[SCP-2764]]]
* [[[SCP-3419]]]</textarea></pre>
