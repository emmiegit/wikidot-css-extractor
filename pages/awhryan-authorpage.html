[[collapsible show=&#34;Author Commentary&#34; hide=&#34;Author Commentary&#34;]]

This was my first article, and also a goblincon entry. Without the help of my co-authors [[*user zenobiyl]] and [[*user rab333]], I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have written anything else. I had 2 other drafts abandoned after realizing how deeply flawed they were, and I was so close to giving up and just moving on to something else, but they showed me how fun it can be to write and also became my first friends in this community.

This article came from a bit of a writing slump. I had 2 articles before this fall into the deletion range, and I was desperately searching for something to show myself that 7535 wasn&#39;t just a fluke, and that I could write something good without the help of others.

Around this time, YouTube decided to recommend me the most far-right, evangelical Christian, homophobic nonsense I had ever seen. I got tired of always seeing it, and tired of YouTube thinking I wanted it. It reminded me of my Christian upbringing that I had worked so hard to get away from. That rage eventually built, surprisingly, into a comedic article about Jesus Christ using social media.

I&#39;m working on following this up with a sequel that will explore the way religion works in the 7678 universe, so stay tuned for that.

While goblincon was the first contest I participated in, I view remixcon as the first contest that I was actually fully in. I played more of a backseat role during the writing process for 7535, and I didn&#39;t want to repeat that mistake.

[[*user troutmaskreplica]] had crit 7678 and I had crit a couple of her articles, so when she said she was remixing 6400, I was ready to help. The concept evolved past what we initially intended, and while we didn&#39;t win the contest, it was a lot of fun.

There&#39;s not much to say about this one. I posted it because I was bored waiting for remixcon posting to open, and my boredom shows. A lot of it is standard wacky anomaly writing, and I want to rewrite it in the future.

This started as a weird idea posed in the brainstorming channel in 19cord by someone who didn&#39;t think they could write it. I loved the idea and decided to write it, and here we are.
