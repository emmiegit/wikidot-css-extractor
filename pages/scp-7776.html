**Item #:** 7776

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** 
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Show Archived Containment Procedures&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]
&gt; No more than 200 individuals may be aware of the existence of SCP-7776 at any given time. Should individuals outside Site-93 learn of SCP-7776, they are to be amnesticised and an investigation into how they learned of it is to be launched.
&gt; 
&gt; A vast majority of those affected by SCP-7776 have taken residence in the village of ██████████ ████, which has been isolated as a quarantine zone as well as location of Site-93. 
&gt; 
&gt; Site-93 is an appropriately staffed Site dedicated to the study and containment of SCP-7776. No ritual activity is to be performed in association with SCP-7776 without explicit written permission and oversight by Site Director Pilecki; additionally, no personnel above Level 3 Clearance may be involved with the management of SCP-7776 without Director Pilecki&#39;s written request.
&gt; 
&gt; --Ritual activity may be conducted with SCP-7776 at the discretion of Site Director Pilecki.--
&gt; 
&gt; --Ritual activity is to be performed with SCP-7776 on a monthly basis.--
&gt; 
&gt; Ritual activity with SCP-7776 is to be conducted on an as needed basis.
&gt; 
&gt; Site-93 observes a specially-tailored communications outline in order to monitor and minimize communication to the outside, and therefore opportunities for a breach of containment through accidental sharing of SCP-7776&#39;s description. Additionally, see Document-93-C &#34;Security Facilities&#34; for an outline of Site-93&#39;s perimeter defenses.
&gt; 
&gt; Personnel who approach Site-93 or request visitation are to be detained and undergo interrogation. Personnel determined to be affected by SCP-7776 may be subject to execution.
&gt; = **Notice:** These Containment Procedures are now obsolete.
[[/collapsible]]
As part of the unique circumstances regarding SCP-7776’s effects, Site-93 acts as a largely independent facility with minimal oversight and contact with the greater Foundation. Communication with the outside is only to be performed by a rotating roster of three designated personnel, following the sanitization directives found in the attached documentation titled “Obscuring Communication”. Personnel are prohibited from unregulated recording of images or videos by any means; permission may be granted for personal photography of special occasions.

In order to ensure privacy, Site-93’s property has been fitted with several monitored, but automated, anti-air systems as well as 3 strategically-placed sniper outposts. Personnel not assigned to Site-93 are not permitted within a 10km radius during travel.

Foundation documentation regarding Site-93 is to describe the site in broad terms, specifying that it contains a ‘cognitohazardous object’, as well as a general summary of the above communication restrictions. It is also required to broadly describe the above situation regarding anti-air systems and snipers.

Knowledge of SCP-7776 must be limited to a maximum of 200 individuals at any given time. Should individuals outside Site-93 learn of SCP-7776, they are to be apprehended, terminated, and an investigation into how they learned of it is to be launched.

Site-93 is constructed surrounding and integrated into ██████████ ████, the local village which SCP-7776 is located within. This village operates autonomously but in partnership with the Foundation in the containment of SCP-7776, observing similar precautions in regards to communication monitoring and maintaining an insular community. Four agricultural zones are maintained in a previously-uninhabited location 18km from Site-93 to contribute to the diets of ██████████ ████’s inhabitants, as part of a comfort and normalcy effort.
 
The use of anomalous technology, and in certain cases, other contained objects known to personnel stationed at Site-93, is permitted in the containment of SCP-7776 in lieu of full Foundation support. As such, a dedicated containment facility is maintained on-site. Here, anomalies temporarily reassigned to Site-93, or potential sub anomalies manifested by SCP-7776 and those irreversibly affected by related ritual activity, may be contained. In addition, an archive containing records of SCP-7776, ██████████ ████, and the local region previously discovered outside of the area. While the chances of discovery of any more documentation outside Site-93 is extraordinarily low, if any is discovered it is to be contained here for reference and study. A total of eight (8) Scantron Reality Anchors have been placed in the middle perimeter wall surrounding Site-93. See attached materials regarding protocol in the case where the anomaly requires the use of anomalous elements. 

Extant residents of ██████████ ████[[footnote]] In addition to all on-site D-Class Personnel. [[/footnote]] have been released and provided training by the Foundation to aid in the containment of SCP-7776. A number of these individuals have been granted Level 2 clearance exclusively in regards to SCP-7776, and are to assist in instructing and aiding Site-93 staff in the containment of that specific anomaly. Of note is that the people of ██████████ ████ and current Site personnel have jointly agreed to the prohibition of further children being born into the population.

In the event that an unassigned Foundation member[[footnote]] Or other GOI operative. [[/footnote]] is detected approaching Site-93, they are to be detained regardless of ranking and interrogated to determine the extent of their knowledge concerning SCP-7776. Should they be determined to have fallen under SCP-7776’s effects, they are to be integrated into Site-93 staff until further review. Individuals of a level 4 clearance or higher, regardless of status or standing in the Foundation, effected by SCP-7776 are to be terminated.

All staff and affected individuals are to convene in ██████████ ████ town hall at 9am daily, in order to allow for the reception of the day’s ritual dictation. Each ritual must be described in accurate detail before witnesses and recorded for posterity within the on-site network. Should it be determined that the received ritual is not excessively harmful or traumatic, the receiver of the vision may be allowed to undertake the ritual within the following 24 hours if they choose to do so. Should no ritual be undertaken within a period of nineteen (19) days, the next ritual[[footnote]] Referred to as a Critical Date Ritual. [[/footnote]] must be undertaken as per decree of the on-site ethics committee and directors. Failure to complete a Critical Date Ritual is to be severely punished, and incentivizing programs are to be instituted to encourage ritual activity.

Staff assigned to Site-93 and the people of ██████████ ████ must remain on-site until death, with escapees to be apprehended or terminated. As such, Site-93 has been outfitted with various recreational activities, therapeutic, amnestic and physical therapy suites. A wing of Site-93 is to be maintained for the purpose of providing counseling, palliative care and medical attention to staff following Ritual Procedures.

**Description:**

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Show Archived Description&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]
&gt; SCP-7776 is a specific line of deductive reasoning and associative thinking with cognitohazardous tendencies. The conclusion of a subject&#39;s investigation will provide them with knowledge of the existence of a groundwater well which they will believe to harbour a hostile entity, intelligence, or force within. 
&gt; 
&gt; This groundwater well is situated in an undisclosed location in the High Tatra mountain range, which border Slovakia and Poland. Cognitohazardous effects have been determined to spread specifically through media directly referencing the well&#39;s appearance, or secondary media derived from this.
&gt; 
&gt; Individuals effected by SCP-7776 feel compelled to participate in hazardous ritual behavior around the well in an effort to appease a hostile presence they believe resides within, and will do so periodically. Such behavior often results in grievous harm towards the participants, frequently via anomalous means, but does not deter further ritual behavior. 
&gt; 
&gt; Should those afflicted by SCP-7776 believe a course of action undertaken to prevent a hostile entity emerging from the well to be anomalous, said course of action will become anomalous via the tulpa effect. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** This description is incorrect and outdated, see below for details.

[[/collapsible]]

SCP-7776 is a groundwater well that exists in the centre of ██████████ ████[[footnote]] A historically fortified village located in an undisclosed location within the High Tatra Mountains bordering Slovakia and Poland. [[/footnote]], possessing a unique structural composition which does not match building materials or compositional techniques historically common to its immediate region. It possesses various anomalous qualities, the most immediate of which being cognitohazardous afflictions of one&#39;s perception of the well. These effects persist in situ, through audiovisual media, or through one&#39;s understanding and familiarity with the well. Cognitohazardous anomalies can become ingrained in an individual who has merely learned about the well&#39;s appearance in a complete enough description, and does not rely on visual or tactile contact.

Afflicted individuals describe that they can perceive a gateway or window at the bottom of the well, which leads to a pocket dimension, cavern, or rarely, a &#39;bubble&#39; that houses an undefined hostile force. This force (hereby SCP-7776-A[[footnote]] Or Obávaná Ohavnosť (The dreaded one). [[/footnote]]) is described only in an individual&#39;s understanding of its apparent intentions, and never a physical appearance or assumed nature. 

Descriptions universally describe the intent to climb the well and enter our reality, as well as an immense cruelty and capacity to enact harm to all life on earth. This understanding also comes with an understanding that this malice may be repelled through performance of a daily ritual. 

The well becomes the subject of intense fear, recurring nightmares, and an aversion towards discussing the anomaly, favouring compulsive self-soothing behaviours and a desire to perform said ritual.

Each day at 9:27pm, one or more persons affected by SCP-7776 will experience an audiovisual hallucination &#39;informing&#39; them of a set of ritual behaviour to be performed nearby SCP-7776, in order to ensure SCP-7776-A will not emerge. Hallucinations are described as &#39;visions&#39;, often in the religious sense, and are painful to the subject&#39;s eyes and teeth. Rituals are often painful, degrading, or possibly deadly, as well as nonsensical and expensive in both monetary and other senses.

Amnestics may remove an individual&#39;s affliction by the fear of SCP-7776-A, but will not remove the occurrence of these visions. Often visions will reinstate SCP-7776&#39;s effect, through the mental image of the well imposing itself on the subject.

Ritual visions are never identical, though certain trends and themes recur fairly often. Each ritual has incorporated a specific chant into its procedure, referred to here as the &#34;standard ritual chant&#34;. This chant is not in any known language or dialect, and any meaning it may carry is unknown. Personnel are not spontaneously capable of reciting said chant, but instead feel as if they must attempt it to the best of their ability.

After experiencing a vision, afflicted subjects experience a powerful urge to carry out the ritual in order to prevent the ingress of SCP-7776-A into our reality. This urge will gradually fade if actions are not performed within a 24-hour period, though subjects will usually experience additional, infrequent visions in following days. The process or criteria determining which individual or individuals will experience these visions is not known, and is believed to be random. Additional visions will depict increasingly complex and invasive rituals, leading to the mental degradation of subjects through heavy stress. SCP-7776&#39;s secondary effects on local reality will also become increasingly pronounced. As such, it is imperative that rituals be carried out as soon as is deemed safe or acceptable, in order to minimize complications.

Rituals seem to develop according to the number of subjects who share the corresponding visions, as well as the resources available. Complexity and cost scale drastically with group size, and will often introduce elements that call upon great personal or professional costs to specific individuals. This may include emotional tolls, monetary transactions, political influence, and in certain cases, the use of other anomalous items within the reach of the Foundation in order to complete. The scale of a ritual may also demand additional persons being &#39;brought in&#39;, whether for inclusion in the performance, or rarely, as a captive audience.

It is inconsistent whether the failure of a given ritual may lead to SCP-7776 imposing severe effects on local reality, and reactions from the object do not correspond to ritual scale, complexity, or violence. Failures universally expand SCP-7776&#39;s influence, however, and must be avoided.

The ambient effects of SCP-7776 are profound, though the area of effect is limited and centered on the well itself. 

* Liquids that pass beyond approximately a metre of SCP-7776’s mouth convert into a thick corrosive fluid. This fluid has shown to be able to sustain biological function in damaged human tissue when removed form SCP-7776 and diluted with 1 part fluid and 8 parts water.

* Weather patterns in a 17km radius of Site-93 remain overcast despite anticipated regional weather patterns, with multiple thunderstorms and snowstorms each month year-round.

* Native wildlife passively maintain a distance of approximately 10km of SCP-7776. 

* Migratory bird populations will pass through this 10km range, but flight patterns often form spirals or rings, and birds display severe confusion upon landing within the area of effect. No notable effects persist in animals that enter and then leave this area of influence.

Persons residing within SCP-7776’s area of effect (e.g., residents of ██████████ ████ and long-term inhabitants assigned to Site-93) may experience anomalous developments. Physical changes, such as normally straight hair becoming curly, or fingerprints changing into irregular spiral shapes, are semi-common effects and do not appear to be hazardous. On occasion, personnel may discover spontaneous dental growth in the palate in a spiral configuration. Several individuals have spontaneously experienced ocular degeneration, with their pupils and irises changing in shape. As Foundation personnel remain in Site-93 for longer, similar alterations are being discovered with increasing frequency.

As stated above, nightmares and visual hallucinations are not uncommon in individuals who spend time within SCP-7776’s area of effect. The feeling of being watched, audio hallucinations of whispering or distant gibberish, or the feeling of hands and breath upon one’s bare skin are reported. These are believed to be connected to SCP-7776, and not the result of natural stress responses.

Should no spontaneous visions, and therefore no ritual activity, occur in the vicinity of SCP-7776 for more than a week or more, the above effects will become far more pronounced and severe. The area of effect will expand outward and other, more severe effects may occur. This includes unstable or randomly shifting topography, precipitation composed of viscera, mental fog, mass hysteria or more. 

On several occasions, SCP-7776 flooded, with volumes of corrosive fluids and fragmentary fresh human remains ejected from the mouth of the well. During these occasions, humanoid figures composed of mud appeared in the immediate radius of the well, and an extreme increase in the apparent population of aggressive //Rattus norvegicus// or common brown rat appeared within ██████████ ████ and Site-93.

**Excerpts from the Log of Rituals:**
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Access Log&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]
Due to the severity of SCP-7776&#39;s reality warping influence, the performance of rituals is imperative to not only minimising these effects but also in preventing the entry of SCP-7776-A into our world. Those who have studied SCP-7776 for an extended period of time such as those of us at Site-93, the villagers residing in ██████████ ████ before the Foundation&#39;s arrival or other groups encountering the anomaly long before have all noted the sheer randomness presented in the visions detailing the rituals. While the rituals do become more complex, harmful and dangerous as time between rituals grown many of those interviewed commented on a belief that luck is a significant factor in not only the assignment of visions, but also the content of the rituals. Beyond the universally negative nature of the rituals, the only commonality between them is a requirement to recite a chant in an unknown language. Research to identify this chant remains underway.

&gt; **Date:** 12/03/2003
&gt; **Persons involved:** Senior Researcher John Rollins
&gt; **Days since last ritual:** 8
&gt; **Completed:** Yes
&gt; ----
&gt; **Ritual summary:** The subject removed all clothing and embedded 17 nails in the sole of each foot and proceeded to use the blood from this action to draw a spiral glyph on his chest. The subject then proceeded to perform a fast jig dance around SCP-7776 whilst repeating the standard ritual chant for 174 minutes until loss of consciousness.
&gt; **Notes:** Subject was taken for treatment immediately following the ritual, and is expected to regain the ability to walk again within three months.

&gt; **Date:** 31/11/2010
&gt; **Persons involved:** Jan Nowak, Zuzanna Nowak, Sgt. Mark Albrecht, Dr Sadie Parker, Tucker Pedersen, Pvt. Hayden Samuels.
&gt; **Days since last ritual:** 19
&gt; **Completed:** Yes
&gt; ----
&gt; **Ritual summary:** All subjects were required to draw straws, with the individual drawing the shortest straw[[footnote]] Tucker Pedersen, formerly D-7776-443. [[/footnote]] to flee into the area surrounding Site-93. After a period of one hour the remaining subjects pursued and proceeded to hunt Pedersen for 256 minutes before terminating them via gunshot. A cut of meat from the deceased was then prepared and consumed by remaining subjects. Surviving subjects then carried the body back to Site-93 and deposited it into SCP-7776 after intoning the standard ritual chant.
&gt; **Notes:** Psychological counseling was provided to the surviving subjects. Significant unrest was noted in the population of former D-Class personnel due to the deceased&#39;s former similar status. All ritual participants were noted to have been directed by their visions to choose a subject to hunt, and elected to make this decision in the fairest way possible.

&gt; **Date:** 17/8/2008
&gt; **Persons involved:** Dr Kateoina Szabó
&gt; **Days since last ritual:** 3
&gt; **Completed:** Yes
&gt; ----
&gt; **Ritual summary:**  Dr Szabó collected all photographs and mementos of loved ones outside the site and deposited them within SCP-7776 while reciting the standard ritual chant.
&gt; **Notes:** All deposited items were reported to visibly smoulder but remain atop the surface of SCP-7776&#39;s corrosive liquid for a period of 24 hours until the enactment of the next ritual.

&gt; **Date:** 3/5/2000
&gt; **Persons involved:** Site Director Svarog Pilecki
&gt; **Days since last ritual:** 32
&gt; **Completed:** No
&gt; ----
&gt; **Ritual summary:** Director Pilecki reported receiving a vision detailing himself ordering the retrieval of SCP-███ from Site-██ and force-feeding it SCP-7776&#39;s corrosive liquid in large quantities whilst reciting the standard ritual chant before directing its release in the nearest civilian settlement of [REDACTED].
&gt; **Notes:** Director Pilecki resigned command of Site-93 on condition of being rendered ineligible for promotion following Event-7776-Omega.

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/balths-sandbox/Ring%207000|caption=Ring recovered from SCP-7776.]]

&gt; **Date:** 13/10/2020
&gt; **Persons involved:** Pvt. Grace Porosus
&gt; **Days since last ritual:** 19
&gt; **Completed:** Yes
&gt; ----
&gt; **Ritual summary:** Subject recovered an ornate ring from SCP-7776 and placed it on her left ring finger before reciting a slight variant of the standard ritual chant. The subject then proceeded to consume a sample of SCP-7776&#39;s corrosive liquid with no ill effect. Following the ritual, the ring was unable to be removed.
&gt; **Notes:** On the 13/10/2021 Pvt. Porosus failed to report for guard duty and was later located within her quarters in an excited catatonic state with numerous semi-human bite wounds on her person. Pvt. Porosus appears unable to vocalise except through sobbing and laughter. Treatment has been unsuccessful.

&gt; **Date:** 25/12/2014
&gt; **Persons involved:** Jan Nowak, Zuzanna Nowak, Nina Nowak
&gt; **Days since last ritual:** 18
&gt; **Completed:** No
&gt; ----
&gt; **Ritual summary:** Jan and Zuzanna Nowak experienced a vision describing a ritual to be enacted wherein they were to place their youngest child (Nina Nowak, 4) inside a large sack alongside several stones, recite the standard ritual chant, and deposit the child into SCP-7776.
&gt; **Notes:** All subjects were distressed by this vision but willing to participate in the ritual. Despite the protestations of one Rostek Ossendowski[[footnote]] An elder and leader of ██████████ ████ prior to the arrival of the Foundation. [[/footnote]] it was determined by Foundation personnel that the ritual was not to be completed.

&gt; **Date:** 23/2/2021
&gt; **Persons involved:** Tomáš Bača
&gt; **Days since last ritual:** 2
&gt; **Completed:** No
&gt; ----
&gt; **Ritual summary:** Mr. Bača experienced a vision describing ritual wherein he was to retrieve a packet of unknown seeds from within SCP-7776, recite the standard ritual chant, and plant them in specific locations within Site-93&#39;s agricultural zone, 20km from SCP-7776.
&gt; **Notes:** Due to the vision failing to adequately depict the consequences of completing this ritual, it was deemed to great a risk to the survival of the staff.

&gt; **Date:** 28/4/2022
&gt; **Persons involved:** Cmdr. Arthur Shepherd, Hillevi Kemppainen 
&gt; **Days since last ritual:** 1
&gt; **Completed:** Yes
&gt; ----
&gt; **Ritual summary:** Subjects consumed an uncooked goat shank, depositing the bone into SCP-7776 when finished. The subjects then placed a cover and bedding over SCP-7776, recited the standard ritual chant, and slept for 9 hours over the well.
&gt; **Notes:** Both subjects have subsequently been observed spending large portions of time together following this ritual. Investigation is underway.

&gt; **Date:** 5/9/2018
&gt; **Persons involved:** Dr. Hank Gardener
&gt; **Days since last ritual:** 13
&gt; **Completed:** Yes
&gt; ----
&gt; **Ritual summary:** The subject retrieved a knife from SCP-7776 and proceeded to remove a portion of muscle from his upper thigh, recite the standard ritual chant, and consume the removed material.
&gt; **Notes:** Prompt medical attention was able to ensure minimal damage to the subject&#39;s mobility, with a stomach pump administered as soon as was possible. 

&gt; **Date:** 27/10/2021
&gt; **Persons involved:** Sgt. G. Chuluunbold
&gt; **Days since last ritual:** 16
&gt; **Completed:** No
&gt; ----
&gt; **Ritual summary:** Sgt. Chuluunbold received a vision instructing him to recite the standard ritual chant before utilising on-site defenses to fire upon civilian air traffic. 
&gt; **Notes:** All parties unanimously rejected the proposition of enacting this ritual.

&gt; **Date:** 19/11/2021
&gt; **Persons involved:** Dr. Gordon ██████
&gt; **Days since last ritual:** 1
&gt; **Completed:** Yes
&gt; ----
&gt; **Ritual summary:** Dr. Gordon approached SCP-7776 and withdrew a 750ml glass jar from within the well, and proceeded to urinate into it while reciting the standard ritual chant. Once the  vessel had been filled, Dr. Gordon sealed the jar with its cap and deposited it within the well.
&gt; **Notes:** Dr. Gordon reported feelings of humiliation and confusion following the event.


&gt; **Date:** 16/12/2007
&gt; **Persons involved:** Dr. Amir Reddy, Pvt. Evelyn Tanner, Jackson Welles, Dr. Max Venturi, Abel Bonhart.
&gt; **Days since last ritual:** 10
&gt; **Completed:** Yes
&gt; ----
&gt; **Ritual summary:** All subjects gathered around SCP-7776, drew blood from their left palms and proceeded to draw spiral symbols on one another&#39;s foreheads before forming a circle around SCP-7776. The subjects then continuously recited the standard ritual chant as they circled SCP-7776 in a clockwise direction a total of seventeen times. All subjects&#39; hands gradually became grafted together over the course of the ritual.
&gt; **Notes:** Surgery to separate the subjects&#39; hands was rapidly undertaken following enactment of the ritual under the guidance of Dr. Reddy over the course of seven hours, and was able to return up to 90% mobility in affected areas. The subjects reported that in spite of understanding the risks of the ritual, they felt obligated to enact it in an effort to prevent larger numbers of site staff from suffering.

**Discovery:**

----
SCP-7776 was discovered by the Foundation in March of 2000, after ‘first contact’ was made with the inhabitants of ██████████ ████. Members of rescue organizations pursuing the wreckage of flight JQ-7923 reported being fired upon by groups of local civilians in an apparently uninhabited area of the High Tatras mountain range, including several recognized to be survivors of the disappeared plane. Upon interception by law enforcement, civilian inhabitants of the village were found to be without records or identification, or familiarity with modern technology (or, computers in general). The Foundation took notice after it became evident that all civilians carried the same warnings regarding the danger in the mountains, and the consistency of phrasing across several dozen individuals.

Satellite imaging was able to locate the village of  ██████████ ████, and remote surveillance was performed until the plane’s remains were discovered just over 7km from the village. Several survivors were identified, as was the route they took by foot to  ██████████ ████. As observation continued, it was believed that the inhabitants were under the effect of an anomalous force, and had coerced the survivors of flight JQ-7923 to participate in rituals and come under the influence of SCP-7776. At this time, no Foundation Personnel had become affected by what would later be defined as SCP-7776, so it was theorized that the villagers were the root cause of the anomaly.

It was decided that ██████████ ████ would be converted into a remote Site, and Foundation operatives were to contain the inhabitants of the village, with the rescue of the airline survivors being a secondary objective. This was dubbed Operation “Golden Eagle”-A, and was largely successful as per the objectives defined in the mission plans. Despite this, numerous inhabitants of the village were able to flee into the surrounding wilderness. 

Construction of the Site began, and the village&#39;s inhabitants were contained for study, along with any survivors of flight JQ-7923 determined to be affected by SCP-7776. Site-93 personnel then began searching for the escaped villagers, and any Foundation personnel affected by SCP-7776 were instructed to report any symptoms and were administered amnestics, as it was believed that the anomaly was an infohazard spread by the villagers rather than from what is now known as SCP-7776 today.

With no rituals being performed, SCP-7776&#39;s reality altering effects rapidly became increasingly pronounced. As the villagers were thought to be the source of the effect, study into the captured villagers was made the highest priority. Within a week the entire site personnel body was affected by SCP-7776, and many had begun to call for rituals to be performed. These individuals were contained alongside 62 of ██████████ ████&#39;s inhabitants. The following weeks were marked by rising casualties to SCP-7776&#39;s effects, with Site Director Svarog Pilecki being forced to order reinforcements from other Foundation Sites.
 
By April, SCP-7776 reached a critical point, affecting an area with an irregular radius averaging 80km and causing catastrophic casualties, resulting in Event-7776-Omega (see Addendum 7776-Omega).
 
Following these events, Site Director Svarog Pilecki established current containment procedures. Materials required to finish construction of SCP-7776 were ordered from the larger Foundation to be delivered to a remote delivery point, and additional resources were sourced from other organisations in an effort to disguise Site-93&#39;s imminent secession from the Foundation. Upon completion of Site-93, the following message was sent to the O5 Council.

= **A message from Site-93**

//Four months ago 783 souls were sent to contain SCP-7776 in the frigid mountains, uprooting their lives and settling an area unknown to the modern world. They left behind families and friends, knowing that by rounding up these dangerous anomalies they would be keeping the world safe. They were wrong, as was I, and that has led to the deaths of 692 of these brave souls. For the insane ramblings of the people we believed to be so dangerous were not so crazed, and even less dangerous. In fact they have been doing our job for us for hundreds of years. They tried to warn us of an anomaly we didn&#39;t believe in, even as we interrogated them under the misguided belief that they were under the effect of an infohazardous mindset. All the while they tried to explain to us the danger that we and the world were in.//

//I am writing to you now to warn you that this threat is very real.//

//SCP-7776 is not an idea guiding individuals towards thaumaturgy and anomalous rituals, rather it is the reason these rituals must be performed, and it is the reason that you must not know any more than is absolutely necessary. What we guard at this site has the potential to harm anyone who comes into contact with it, but with a Foundation presence it has the potential to harm billions through us, including the entire SCP Foundation. That is the reason that as of now there is no longer an us.//

//Effective immediately, you are to cease monitoring of this Site. We have already scrubbed your servers of records relating to SCP-7776 that would be harmful to the Foundation and to you on the council personally, and have implemented our own remote sub-net on-Site. You may contact us at your leisure through this secure line, but be aware that in order to properly contain SCP-7776 we will not be at liberty to disclose any information beyond what you already know. This is for the safety and integrity of the SCP Foundation and the O5 Council, and we will not allow you to become compromised.//

//While we mean no harm to any of our sister sites or any Foundation Personnel, be warned that we have no choice but to enforce this parting with lethal force. A 20km exclusion zone around Site-93 is now in effect, and anyone seen entering this zone will be terminated. This is for the good of all. I do not doubt that you will attempt to reconnect with us, and we have taken measures to prevent this. You will not see the inside of this Site, and you will not be compromised by SCP-7776.//

//I am sorry it needed to end this way. Goodbye.// 

//Site Director Svarog Pilecki, Site-93.//

**History of ██████████ ████**
Current understanding leads us to believe that ██████████ ████ was founded sometime before the year 549 AD; an especially old structure in the southern edge of the village bears Roman iconography warning of plague within the town[[footnote]] Consistent with similar artifacts found from the period of Justinian&#39;s plague, a bubonic plague outbreak that spread across much of Europe between 541 and 549 AD. [[/footnote]]. In 1379 Pope Urban VI and King Louis I of Hungary (which then incorporated Slovakia) ordered the village purged of its population for as of yet unclear reasons.

Despite its isolation, ██████████ ████ has historically been self-sufficient. The primary mundane issue the town has historically suffered is inbreeding as a result of its natural isolation, with new arrivals often being lost hikers, plane crash survivors, or other lost individuals. As a result of this, the town&#39;s culture has a cosmopolitan nature, incorporating elements of new arrivals&#39; cultures. On two occasions, individuals have discovered forgotten records indicating SCP-7776’s existence and become afflicted with its mental effect, and come to ██████████ ████ through great personal expense; the archives where these records were discovered have since been acquired, filtered, and replaced.

Among residents, SCP-7776 is reviled and described as the door to &#34;Obávaná Ohavnosť [[footnote]] The Dreaded One. [[/footnote]]&#34;, a description of the malicious force as an apocalyptic figure. As such, the performing of rituals to prevent this is seen as a shared responsibility among all residents of the village. Residents are tasked with chores and work six days a week, and maintain close multigenerational bonds, as well as a culture of mutual aid to ensure every member is supported.

The town’s religion is nominally Catholic, though with a blend of Eastern Orthodox and regional Christian traditions as well. Of note are twelve suits of armor displayed within the central church, each bearing the coat of arms of the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/gruppi-di-interesse Confraternity of Saint George&#39;s Knights]. Residents of the town attribute these as belonging to a group of &#34;Saviors&#34; from the middle ages. Many homes within the village have a space dedicated to altars believed to be a corruption of catholic shrines, with residents describing them as aiding in the containment of SCP-7776. It is unknown if this claim is accurate, and research into a belief-based effect on SCP-7776 is ongoing.

Many residents of ██████████ ████ display physiological and psychological abnormalities. It is believed that this is due to not only long-term effects of inbreeding and exposure to SCP-776, but also the cultural and mental coping mechanisms required to inhabit such a remote, stressful environment. Long-term residents have displayed higher than usual pain tolerance, stress thresholds and individualism than seen outside of ██████████ ████, in addition the occasional manifestation of low-level reality warping abilities, usually minor telekinesis. Individuals born in the town have a higher rate of congenital conditions such as heterochromia, albinism, arachnodactyly and acromegaly.

Following Event-7776-Omega and the completion of Site-93, Foundation personnel have largely been accepted by the inhabitants of ██████████ ████. Foundation technology and infrastructure has greatly benefited the population with the introduction of electricity, modern medical technology, agricultural technology, manufacturing and construction. It is hoped that a combination of the Foundation&#39;s expertise in containment and the local populations longstanding traditions and knowledge surrounding SCP-7776 may aid in the anomaly&#39;s long-term containment and harm reduction in regards to its harmful effects on the afflicted.

&gt; **Interviewed:** Dariush Saberi
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. James Okello
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Following the integration of ██████████ ████&#39;s population into Site-93, Mr. Saberi has offered to explain aspects of the town&#39;s culture, history and relationship with SCP-7776.
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** Thank you for offering your time to us Mr. Saberi, it&#39;s appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** Not at all, if you are going to be staying here it&#39;s important for you to know our ways. A lot have been here even longer than me or were even born here, so they&#39;re pretty set in their ways.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** So you were not born here then?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** Well that&#39;s just jumping straight into it. Didn&#39;t even give me a chance to light my smoke.
&gt; 
&gt; //Mr. Saberi proceeds to roll and light a cigarette as he talks.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** Want one?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** I&#39;m fine, thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** Good, was only offering to be polite. And no, I wasn&#39;t born here. I was just some tourist, I wanted to see wild animals. Really wild, you know? From the virgin forests not on the back of a truck on a safari. Trekked up from ███████, had my camera, tent, provisions and all. I&#39;d been out here for weeks photographing a pack of wolves. Real wolves, not those hair covered half dogs city folk call wolves, and before you knew it there were no animals anywhere anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** What do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** I mean there was //nothing.// No tracks, no sound, no smell. It was like a world where only plants existed. Of course I know now it was because they were smarter than me, they were afraid of the Well and I hadn&#39;t a clue. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** We have observed that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** Yes, most notice that first. The next thing I noticed was Serj. An Azerbaijani pointing a gun at me and screaming something or other. I had no clue, but I knew there was no cover behind me, so I ran through him. I wasn&#39;t about to get shot and I figured there would be better places to hide behind him. Fool I was. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** You didn&#39;t know then.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** Well I do now. He chased me trying to save my life, stop me seeing the Well, and I kept running. He didn&#39;t even have any bullets I found out later. Too late, my life was already over, I&#39;d seen the well over a hill and it felt like I&#39;d been kicked by a mule. The fear, always worst when you see it for the first time. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** I remember my first time, yes. What happened when you entered the village?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** They seemed sad, they felt bad for me. I was put in a room and everyone talked at me until someone spoke Iranian. Then they explained where I was, that I couldn&#39;t leave, and what would happen. I panicked. Tried to run, but there were dozens of them, and I was tied to a board. Stayed that way until my first Vision, and then I understood. There was no leaving. It was my job now, to make sure Obávaná Ohavnosť never comes out of that well.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** That&#39;s quite a change in attitude. How long did that take?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** More than a week. Less than two. What helped is the kindness I was shown. My wailing and crying were not scorned, but met with sympathy. I think had they been the savages I first believed them to be I may have taken my own life.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** I see. Well, thank you your honesty.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** Welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** So what can you tell me of the culture here?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** Everything centers around the Well. It&#39;s our duty to keep Obávaná Ohavnosť trapped down there, and we do everything we can in service of that duty. In fact many here think you do not take this duty seriously enough. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** How so?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** They think you wait too long between rituals. Before you came it was never longer than three days between them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** And the psychological toll of such frequent rituals?
&gt; 
&gt; //Mr. Saberi shrugs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** You get used to it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** I see. We will take that under advisement. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** Mhm. Besides, you&#39;ve seen how we look after one another. The dances, plays. I met my wife here, because we are open and tender. Our hearts must be open to joy and truth rather than steeled against the good and the bad.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** I can see the virtue in that. Is that why religion is so important to your people?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** //Our people//. And yes, we take our comfort where we can get it. Those of us who were born here even say that that the church was built by heroes from a far away land. It helps give us hope, especially since it&#39;s true.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** It is?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** That&#39;s one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you.
&gt; 
&gt; //Mr. Saberi produces a timber chest from his rucksack and passes it to Dr. Okello.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** These are letters from the heroes, they&#39;ll explain all about the church and the walls. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** I see. I&#39;ll be sure our researchers get these. Thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** Mhm.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** Before I go, there is one other thing I need to ask. In all our research, we have not been able to understand how we receive the rituals. If Obávaná Ohavnosť is so powerful and dreadful, it seems odd that we would simply be presented the opportunity to stop it daily. Why do we receive them? Is there any reason taught here? anything at all?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** Now that&#39;s the age old question isn&#39;t it? Some of the old timers when I first came here used to talk about some legendary figure that fought Obávaná Ohavnosť, forced it into the well and cursed it to be bound by the rituals. I think that&#39;s crap, so do most of us. The prevailing theory is that it&#39;s a defense mechanism of the universe or ordained by God, you know? It&#39;s adapted to things trying to get in this way. But that doesn&#39;t feel right to me either.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** What feels right to you then? Surely not the theory that the rituals are a game it plays?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** No, that&#39;s horse shit. If it were a game it wouldn&#39;t try so hard to win, it would just win. I think it&#39;s all just random chance. Luck.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** Luck?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** Yeah, luck. No one ever asked why vampires need permission to enter a building, they just need it. Lucky. Same thing here, we just got lucky that that thing in the Well needs us to fail if it wants us to get in. That&#39;s all. No more no less.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Okello:** That&#39;s certainly an interesting theory, Mr. Saberi. It may well be the case. But we prefer to know things for certain.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. Saberi:** Good luck with that.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Examination of the box and its contents provided by Mr. Saberi proved to be enlightening as to elements of ██████████ ████&#39;s history regarding its absence from maps and general knowledge. In addition to medieval era holy artifacts, the box contained copies of letters sent from a knight of the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/gruppi-di-interesse Confraternity of Saint George&#39;s Knights] addressed to a superior at the Vatican in the late 14th century.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Documentation: Dragomari Andrat, CCSG&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]

&gt; Your Eminence, Cardinal Tebaldeschi,
&gt; 
&gt; Despite this most terrible winter, we have at last found this cursed hamlet and indeed the King[[footnote]] King Louis I of Hungary, which then incorporated present day Slovakia and Poland.[[/footnote]] was most wise to beseech His Holiness[[footnote]] Pope Urban VI. [[/footnote]] for aid. Not yet two days have passed and already we have witnessed most terrible unholy rites performed. It is our belief that surely this is why the plague refused to touch this place. We have taken the settlement with little difficulty, for they possess no walls or militia, and have placed many of the pagans in irons for questioning. They of course deceive and blaspheme with their every breath. They claim to be godly people, yet only four are able to recite a simple Hail Mary. 
&gt; 
&gt; I regret to inform you that despite our swift occupation of the hamlet many pagans did escape into the forest. Brother Cabbani is confident they will be carried off by wolfs and cold, but there has been no sight nor sound of any game for days now. Rest assured our sorties will hunt them down and bring them to holy justice. For now we shall put any who refuse to take the cross to the sword.
&gt; 
&gt; Yours in Christ,
&gt; Dragomari Andrat, Knight Commander.

&gt; Your Eminence, Cardinal Tebaldeschi,
&gt; 
&gt; It is with a heavy heart that I must inform you that our hunt for the pagans has been plagued with failure and misfortune. While my men are great and formidable knights, these pagans hide and use foul sorcery to hinder us. These woods are thick, and the terrain too difficult for our horses. Even in the light of the sun, it can be dark as a moonless night in the deep woods, and they know this.
&gt; 
&gt; At least we may thank the grace of God that no wolfs or bears trouble us here. I believe they are afraid of what the heathens have done to this place, for the only beasts we see here are scabrous rats and the birds whose passing overhead seems to my eyes twisted and ungodly. Even such pure creatures as they are not safe from this evil.
&gt; 
&gt; Whats more is that the pagans steal into the hamlet past our watch to put spells and curses on us in the night. With each passing day their toll weighs ever heavier on our hearts. The foul well here is clearly a great and terrible source of their magick, and has become a most frightful thing to behold. Daily we are plagued with terrible visions of this //diaboli anomali//[[footnote]] Demonic anomaly. [[/footnote]], and our attempts to destroy it are met with no avail. Even black powder, battering ram and catapult fail to leave so much as a scratch. I fear that these pagans may take many months to root out, and as their spells continue to take their toll it will only become all the more tiresome. 
&gt; 
&gt; Already we have lost seven brothers to these foul magicks, but we have driven off each attempt by the pagans to reach their well. Brothers Fiore, Lancia, Caracciolo and Palude simply sank into the ground itself as if it were not there. Those we have captive claim to detest the well as much as we, but offer only taunts in reply to questioning, claiming that we must engage in their sorcery to save ourselves. 
&gt; 
&gt; If I might speak frankly, your Eminence, this business troubles me to my very soul. While I must present as bold and unbothered by the events around me for the sake of the men, I have never before seen a //diaboli anomali// such as this. The visions with which it plagues us are so vile, but also of a nature that could not be known to any but ones self and the Lord. On the sabbath I was plagued with a vision wherein I took my blade and cleaved Brother Ferruccio open, only to seal Brother Enzo within him with needle and thread. How can this be? Long have I feared such a fate, as my father warned would befall me should I stray from my tasks when I was but a boy, but not to a single soul have I confessed this. No //diaboli anomali// I have faced has known of this weakness before, so why does this?
&gt; 
&gt; I shall report on progress when it comes, though I expect it shall be slow. God be with us.
&gt; 
&gt; Yours in Christ,
&gt; Dragomari Andrat, Knight Commander.

&gt; Your Eminence, Cardinal Tebaldeschi,
&gt; 
&gt; We have been fools. Even as the heavens rain blood upon us and the very earth has swallowed knight and pagan with no discernation, we have remained steadfast in our mission. All but myself and eighteen others have survived this place. We are cut off now, a horde of vermin encircles the hamlet and mercilessly consume any who stray too close. Even plate stands no chance, as Brother Nicholas so awfully demonstrated. The earth at times births blasphemous deformities of mud and timbers that stalk the night, impaling those unfortunate to be in their paths upon themselves like macabre pennons.
&gt; 
&gt; We dare not trust our own eyes, for we are plagued with fleeting visions of demons moving within the walls themselves. How we share these delusions I can not say, but to believe them to be true seems almost worse than to not trust ones own eyes. The very earth beneath our feet is more akin to a battlefield than mud and sod, having turned to fetid meat that mingles with the mud underfoot.
&gt; 
&gt; I have taken those of us left to the center of the village around the //diaboli anomali// and have erected defenses. Among us are the remaining pagans, who while lacking in skill at arms possess great conviction and fortitude. I am ashamed to say that I have been uncharitable in my assessment of these people. Godless though they are, they have proven to be willing converts. Indeed many take strength from the Lords grace, and have joined us at prayer. Conversing with them openly has taught me that these people were pagans not by choice, but happenstance. They have fallen prey to a terrible demon that makes his home within the well here, and have taken it upon themselves to keep it sealed within lest it emerge and spread its corruption elsewhere. The visions that have hounded us are in fact the key to salvation, for they are the weapon used to combat this demon.
&gt; 
&gt; The visions appear nightly now, more terrible with each passing day. The earth heaves like the belly of a pregnant mother, and it has been four days since we last glimpsed the sun. This can only mean the demon draws ever nearer, and it is clear what we must do. We have attempted to vanquish this evil by all of our means, exhausting our holy water and spirits to no avail. All that is left is to heed the visions and pray that it is God&#39;s will, for I know not what else we can do. I draw strength from the knowledge that only the Lord sees mens hearts, and perhaps that means our visions have been his will.
&gt; 
&gt; Lord help us.
&gt; 
&gt; Yours in Christ,
&gt; Dragomari Andrat, Knight Commander. 

&gt; Your Eminence, Cardinal Tebaldeschi,
&gt; 
&gt; It is done.
&gt; 
&gt; Three nights ago we performed a most horrible rite to drive the demon back into its lair, but now only twelve of us remain. We have paid a terrible price, but order has been restored. Gone are the rats and blood, and I can think clearly once more. 
&gt; But our rite was not enough. Still we are granted Vision from the Lord. It is clear we must remain here to guard this place. No weapon has proven capable of destroying the well, and I fear that any who gaze upon it shall be ensnared just as we have. I am sorry to say we have failed in our mission. All that is left now is to ensure that this cursed place cannot take more souls.
&gt; 
&gt; It is my proposal that ██████████ ████ is to be forgotten. Every map, every text, every scrap of knowledge is to be erased from the world so that none may come and be ensnared by this burden. We survivors shall fortify the town for this very purpose, and shall require resupply to do so. Any who stray too close must be turned away by force, so the demons influence may stretch no further than it already has. 
&gt; 
&gt; Once our work is done and the fortifications built, we shall remain and serve out our days in opposition to this foul well. While we may have failed to destroy it thus far, I am confident that in time the strength shall be granted us to shatter our adversary, for surely with its destruction so too shall come that of the demon. I pray that some day we may succeed.
&gt; 
&gt; I am also pleased to bring tidings of the villagers here. All have accepted the Lord into their hearts, and they yearn with all their hearts for a house of God to be built in this place. Surely this is a sign that what I propose is just.
&gt; 
&gt; Yours in Christ,
&gt; Dragomari Andrat, Knight Commander.

**Addendum 7776-2:** Reconstruction of events: Event-7776-Omega
Prior to current containment procedures, Site-93 was primarily situated outside of ██████████ ████&#39;s walls as a small subterranean facility. The working theory was that a memetic cognitohazard affected local citizenry, which would inflict mass hysteria. It was also believed that ritual behaviour was the trigger for the disruptions to baseline reality.

For a period of time after the initial establishment of SCP-7776, villagers were held in containment and procedures were designed to suppress ritual effects. The primary goal at the time was to suppress and ‘cure’ the then-thought-to-be delusional effects evident in their behaviour. This led to a 37-day period of time where no rituals to contain SCP-7776-A were performed. Witness testimony, surviving security and body camera footage and examination of the area have been used to reconstruct the events below.

This period of 37 days saw an increasing instability in local reality centered on SCP-7776, as well as the increased distress in villagers’ well being in response to the Foundation’s prevention of ritual behaviour. This was believed to be a symptom of the villager&#39;s distress over being unable to perform ritual behavior, and their given explanations of the true nature of SCP-7776 continued to be rejected by on-site personnel.

As effects became more extreme, the site suffered increasingly heavy losses. Within 15 days, all personnel on-site became affected by the cognitohazardous effect, and then director Dr Eliza Németh shifted priorities from containment of personnel and cognitohazardous behaviour, towards putting significant Foundation resources into ritual activity. Due to the extensive resources available to Level 4 personnel, rituals prescribed by visions were extensive and massively draining, demanding six to seven figure financial commitments, political demands, and massive personnel requirements. Consequently, Site Director Svarog Pilecki was forced to request additional staff from the nearest Site to compensate for the increasing number of casualties caused by SCP-7776&#39;s disruption of baseline reality and the present staff. Contact with Site-93 was lost shortly thereafter.

Days after Director Pilecki&#39;s request, a four man survey team was dispatched from Site-120 to determine the severity of the situation and ascertain the resources and manpower required to resume normal operations in the area. Due to severe snowstorms air travel was deemed impossible, and the team was forced to wait until the fourth of May for conditions to improve. A lack of roads or trails combined with the mountainous terrain of the area necessitated the use of all terrain vehicles for the final approach of the site, whereupon it was discovered that SCP-7776&#39;s effect on local reality had reached catastrophic levels.

Initial approach was hampered by SCP-7776&#39;s effects. Rainfall composed of blood had turned the ground to a bog, forcing the abandonment of the team&#39;s vehicles. Geometric anomalies also were reported, though avoided. As a result, the team circled the Site several times before achieving entry, where they found the site to be running on emergency generators and unmanned. Numerous tracks were reported emerging from Site-93 toward the village, but it was determined that the site be investigated prior to the town.

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/balths-sandbox/site%2093.jpg|caption=Interior of Site-93&#39;s administrative wing, east corridor.]]

Investigation into the site revealed that the containment wing had suffered numerous breaches, though the majority of its occupants remained in their cells. Inhabitants of the containment wing were segregated into different wards composed entirely of ██████████ ████&#39;s inhabitants or of affected Foundation personnel. A large portion of those secured within their cells had entered into psychotic or catatonic states due to SCP-7776&#39;s effects. Some had become partially fused with the walls and ceilings of the cells, with most apparently being victims of spatial positioning shifts, and two others seeming to ‘melt’. Civilians remained largely catatonic or non-hostile, but a small number of affected Foundation personnel proved aggressive and made attempts to assault the team. While the team was largely able to avoid confrontation with the afflicted individuals, they were forced to engage a pair of conjoined Foundation staff members, resulting in the deaths of both members and Survey Agent ███.

Of those Foundation personnel contained within Site-93, seventeen individuals (including Dr. Németh) proved to be lucid though under the effect of SCP-7776. These individuals were released from their cells by the survey team, where they explained that the worsening of SCP-7776
&#39;s effects had disrupted the site&#39;s communications, and that the Foundation&#39;s current understanding of the anomaly was entirely incorrect. When questioned about the status of the remaining Foundation staff, Dr. Németh explained that the worsening effects of the anomaly had caused them to experience windows of insanity or complete catatonia, and that they had last been observed heading towards SCP-7776.

Following a debriefing from the remaining lucid Foundation staff on the true nature of SCP-7776 and the necessity of performing rituals to properly contain it, it was determined that a ritual was to be conducted over SCP-7776 in order to avert a potential K-class scenario. The survey team aided the site&#39;s survivors in restraining ██ individuals from various containment cells and in gathering supplies needed to perform the ritual and to reach SCP-7776 safely. Once properly outfitted the group proceeded to exit the Site and approach the village by standard transport.

As the group approached the village, large numbers of rats were encountered swarming the area. This, combined with the steep incline of the terrain, deep mud and poor visibility as a result of blood coating the vehicle&#39;s windscreen caused progress to slow significantly. Approximately 200 metres from the southern gate of the village both vehicles became stranded during travel, as rats entered the exhaust and engine bays and caused obstructions to engine components. Flame suppression units were used to clear a path for the group to safely exit the vehicle and approach the village. The approach was slow as flame units were required to continuously fend off attack from rats, which displayed extreme aggression and no regard for their own safety, often charging suicidally into the flames in an effort to harm the group.

Despite the onslaught of rats, particularly during passage through the gatehouse, the group successfully entered the village suffering only superficial injuries. Within the village the presence of rats was much reduced. Local reality within the village appeared more heavily affected by SCP-7776 than the surrounding area, with multiple structures seen intersecting and fusing together at random, and geometric anomalies or gravity anomalies present. Numerous Foundation personnel were sighted within the village, slowly moving throughout the area in a counterclockwise route, in hysterical states and frequently clawing at their own and each other’s faces. Attempts to communicate with these individuals were unsuccessful, with the affected persons ignoring outside stimuli and incessantly shouting incomprehensibly. Evidence of incomplete corpses previously consumed by rats were present close to the point of entry.

Following the central path of the village, the group continued towards SCP-7776 over the course of twenty minutes. Flame units saw continuous use fending off groups of rats and hostile humans devoid of reason, with one individual in particular having to be terminated with small arms fire while attempting to assault Dr. Németh with a bear trap. As the group approached SCP-7776 in the center of ██████████ ████, progress once more slowed due to difficult terrain. Spatial shifts had rendered multiple routes of access impassable due to destructive spaces, vacuum, or gravity anomalies, and flooding from SCP-7776 introduced caustic mud to the route.

Remaining Survey Team members were noted to have entered into a state of panic upon visual confirmation of SCP-7776, halting progress as established Site-93 personnel calmed them. At a distance of 60 metres a ground tremor shook the area, driving the investigation to take shelter against a civilian[[footnote]] Noted to have been the village smith shop. [[/footnote]] structure’s stone walls. SCP-7776 proceeded to release copious amounts of caustic fluid, with a thick and extremely dark appearance, along with the deceased and nude bodies of ███ Collete, █████ Grundie and ██████ Alexander. These agents had previously passed away on-site and been cremated. Each cadaver was observed to have broken jaws and damaged limb joints and eyes.

Prior to the earth tremor subsiding, a large portion of fungal coated porous stone detached from one of the aerial structures above the area and landed within the town square, adjacent to SCP-7776. Later inspection of the stone showed it to be composed of a similar material to SCP-7776 itself, previously having been of locally-common granite. The force of this impact caused the bodies emerging from SCP-7776 to be swept into a mass of mud and debris against the wall opposite the group.

After treating minor injuries suffered during the quake, the group proceeded to circle behind several buildings, seeking a route to safely traverse to approach SCP-7776. Mud entities appeared at this point to pursue the group, hampering traversal of terrain. Their movements were slow, but the presence of the entities posed a complication. 

It was determined that the best course of action would be to approach SCP-7776 from the north, and to set more severely injured parties to a shed-type structure atop a hill closer to the anomaly, where preparations would be made before performing the prescribed ritual. This route through the village&#39;s back alleys proved both expedient and dangerous; the density of structures along the route impeded the flow of caustic mud, but allowed for multiple hiding spots for remaining groups of frenzied rats and individual unsound human hostiles. Flame suppression units were used extensively to clear pockets of rats, and small arms fire was used to dissuade four to five hostile Foundation staff from pursuit.

From the north wall of the village, the group proceeded to approach SCP-7776 through the town square park area. At this point flame suppression units depleted, though the dwindling numbers of present rats were susceptible to small arms fire and flashbang grenades. Due to the burden of equipment required for the ritual, aiding injured or catatonic personnel in their travel to the site chosen for the ritual, and difficulties with terrain, 26 meters of travel took 40 minutes.

While the bulk of the group was reaching the top of the hill, the area was shaken by another earth tremor coinciding with a spatial shift. Relative gravity along the slope of the hill began to steepen, causing mud and debris to flow rapidly, making ascent actively hostile. It is believed that an underground spatial shift created a void behind the group, which opened a sinkhole at the base of the hill; mud, blood and debris were observed to circle the sinkhole as they were pulled in, forming a whirlpool of sorts behind the group as they attempted to ascend.

Within two hours of loss of contact, an additional set of survey teams along with an armed escort were sent to investigate the initial teams. These later teams discovered the village to be in significantly worse condition than the initial team had encountered. Unknown processes led to the complete desertion of the village, with various structures in different states of disrepair. The remains of approximately 150 deceased Foundation personnel were found across the town, with more complete remains damaged by corrosive liquids, self-inflicted injuries to the head, or bearing evidence of consumption by rats. Subsequent autopsies discovered geometric brain anomalies and gibberish lettering recently etched into teeth and bones via unknown means. Four bodies were found with the gastrointestinal tract and aorta packed with dry rock matching local sources, and six discovered with injuries consistent with deep-sea decompression. None of these ten bodies had any recognizable patterns that would lead to an explanation of why they suffered similar anomalies.

Of those found within ██████████ ████, only Site Director Svarog Pilecki was found alive within a cafeteria freezer unit half submerged in the earth. Though suffering severe self inflicted facial wounds and bruising trauma Director Pilecki was able to resume duties, but possesses no memory of the incident. 

Examination of deceased rats in the village prior to disposal showed them to be malformed, with scabrous fur, abnormal growths on their skin and copious amounts of both human and rat flesh in their digestive tracts. Judging from rodent populations in recordings of this event and eyewitness reports, a single-digit percentage of rodent corpses were recovered, in comparison to what should be expected.

Site-93 itself (e.g., the Foundation-built modern facility) was found to have been comparatively unaffected. Site staff and village inhabitants sealed within bunkers and containment cells were shown to have a 72% survival rate, and were able to debrief the survey team on the true nature of SCP-7776. Repair and expansion of the site commenced rapidly, and began its journey towards a more independent role in the Foundation.
