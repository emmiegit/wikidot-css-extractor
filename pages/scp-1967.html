[[include component:image-block name=1967-new.jpg|caption=Fifth entrance to SCP-1967, documented during initial containment.]]


**Item #:** SCP-1967

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Any entrance to SCP-1967 is to be constructed over, and security personnel posing as homeowners are to be assigned to guard it. Residential homes connected to SCP-1967 are to be purchased through the Foundation realty front &#34;Suburban Community Purchases&#34; and be guarded in the same manner. Only personnel from [[[mtf-psi-7-home-improvement-hub|MTF-ψ-7 &#34;Home Improvement&#34;]]] are permitted to enter SCP-1967.

**Description:** SCP-1967 is a spatial anomaly, currently known to exist in 3 locations: A suburban neighborhood in Plantation, FL, an office building in Miami, FL, and an apartment building in Miami, FL. It can be entered via a number of different entrances, with current means including a swimming pool, a rabbit hole, jumping a certain distance from a swing, and through approximately 22 side yards. As of 11/16/1987, approximately ██ separate entrances and exits have been found.[[footnote]]Similarity between the effects and location of this anomaly and [[[SCP-2147]]] has been noted. Research into a potential shared origin is currently ongoing.[[/footnote]]

Subjects entering SCP-1967 will see it as a large field, bordered by the backs of homes, offices, and apartments. The geography of this area is flat, with a random arrangement of palm trees, bushes, and benches. Subjects may observe and place objects into the interior of the buildings appearing to border SCP-1967, but will not be able to enter them. The subject will not be visible from within the building. Buildings bordering SCP-1967 are not physically located near it, but appear to be connected through proximity to SCP-1967 entrances.

SCP-1967 was discovered on 11/18/1959, when a resident of &#34;█████ ████ ██████&#39;█&#34;[[footnote]]A residential neighborhood within Plantation, FL[[/footnote]] reported its properties to the local police. Agents were able to suppress information about SCP-1967&#39;s properties, and were able to successfully enact containment. 

**Addendum 1967-1:** Personnel have noted seeing children moving through SCP-1967. These reports are currently being investigated.

**Addendum 1967-3:** The children have been identified as residents of &#34;█████ ████ ██████&#39;█&#34;, with their method of entering SCP-1967 currently being unknown. Personnel have been instructed to keep observation of these subjects until their method of entrance is determined. 

**Addendum 1967-4:** Following surveillance operations, an additional 11 entrances to SCP-1967 have been blocked. No additional containment breaches have been reported as of 12/12/1960, and all subjects involved have been administered Class-E amnestics.

**Addendum 1967-7:** Personnel continue to report an additional juvenile subject present within SCP-1967. Identification efforts have been hampered due to the subject wearing a cloth covering over their face. Agent have been assigned to the interior of SCP-1967 in order to capture and detain the subject.

**Addendum 1967-11:** As of 1/13/1972, SCP-1967 has ceased displaying anomalous properties. Containment procedures have been slated for amendment.

**Addendum 1967-13:** SCP-1967 has resumed anomalous activity. Agents have reported finding documents and equipment marked as belonging to the &#34;███ ███&#34; corporation, which is located in Miami, FL.

**Addendum 1967-16:** &#34;█████ ███&#34;, an employee of &#34;███ ███&#34; has been detained. 

**Addendum 1967-██:** Interview with&#34;███ ███&#34;, hereafter referred to as Subject 1967-A.

&gt; **Interviewed:** Subject 1967-A
&gt;  
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Boyd
&gt;  
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Boyd:** When did you first notice the anomaly?
&gt;  
&gt; **Subject 1967-A:** You mean the back roots[!-- THIS IS NOT A TYPO --]? We all knew about it as kids. It was just the space between the houses, we&#39;d use it to play hide n&#39; seek or manhunt, and get to other houses to play or whatever.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Boyd:** And you didn&#39;t find the properties unusual?
&gt;  
&gt; **Subject 1967-A:** Nah man, we were kids. We thought everyone had it that way. S&#39;not like we had that many other neighborhoods to compare it to, y&#39;know what I&#39;m saying?
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Boyd:** ... Alright. How long did you use it?
&gt;  
&gt; **Subject 1967-A:** Probably from when I was... I want to say 4, but it might&#39;ve been a bit earlier... to when I was 12. Yeah, I was 12. I remember because it happened at my birthday party.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Boyd:** What happened?
&gt;  
&gt; **Subject 1967-A:** The guards showed up.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Boyd:** Guards?
&gt;  
&gt; **Subject 1967-A:** I think you&#39;d know more about that than I would.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Boyd:** Humor me.
&gt;  
&gt; **Subject 1967-A:** Fine, fine... you guys have a weird game going on here, don&#39;tcha? The guards were the owners, I guess, or the people who lived in the back roots. After they showed up, they&#39;d chase us whenever we went in. Never actually went through and caught us... just chased us out. Guess they didn&#39;t want kids on their lawn, heh.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Boyd:** How long did this go on?
&gt;  
&gt; **Subject 1967-A:** Well, I dunno. Probably the rest of the time I was a kid, I guess. The other kids living on the block didn&#39;t really remember the back roots as they grew up, they kinda grew out of it. Looked at me funny when I talked about it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Boyd:** But you still had access.
&gt;  
&gt; **Subject 1967-A:** Yeah, through a hedge in my yard. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Boyd:** What did you do, if nobody else was around?
&gt;  
&gt; **Subject 1967-A:** Pshhh... you&#39;re really this persistent in carrying on? I&#39;d just... mess with the guards. Throw stuff at &#39;em, or try to provoke them. Never chased me if I didn&#39;t point myself out to them. Might&#39;ve been the mask.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Boyd:** Mask?
&gt;  
&gt; **Subject 1967-A:** Yeah, I wore a mask. So the guards couldn&#39;t get me, seen? If they couldn&#39;t see my face, they wouldn&#39;t make me forget.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Boyd:** And how long did this go on?
&gt;  
&gt; **Subject 1967-A:** Through my middle school and high school years. When I went off to college, it kinda got lost in the shuffle.
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Boyd:** Is this what caused it to deactivate?
&gt;  
&gt; **Subject 1967-A:** Look, I dunno man. Y&#39;all are the ones in charge around here, why don&#39;t you tell me?
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Boyd:** ... Can you explain?
&gt;  
&gt; **Subject 1967-A:** You guys. The guards. Are we gonna start the game again soon, or what? Because this is getting a little tiresome. 
&gt;  
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt;  
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Subject 1967-A disappeared from Foundation custody shortly after the completion of this interview, and has been marked as a person of interest.
