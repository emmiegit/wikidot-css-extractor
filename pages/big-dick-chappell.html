[[include component:image-block-quoted name=dickchap.png|caption=ca. 1920|width=237px]]
SCP-046-ARC, infamous Chicago Spirit leader Richard Chappell, was detained by the Foundation in 1933 after a raid on his estate and placed in containment. Due to Chappell&#39;s increasing age, both his mental and physical wellness rapidly deteriorated during his confinement. In his last few years, he was a shell of his former self, often ranting to himself about topics no one else quite understood, or lost in his own memories. What follows is a short collection of some of his more outrageous statements, collected by his personal nurses.

&gt; &#34;I don&#39;t trust no man who drinks water. Fish fuck in that stuff, see?&#34;

&gt; &#34;I don&#39;t think children should be heard //or// seen. Fuck &#39;em. No children.&#34;

&gt; &#34;You know, I saw some kid putting ketchup on his hot dog today. Really pissed me off.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &#34;I killed him.&#34;

&gt; &#34;You know who I don&#39;t trust? Women. And men are on THIN FUCKING ICE!&#34;

&gt; &#34;Is it still okay to say Oriental? I can&#39;t remember.&#34;

&gt; &#34;You know what I hate? Clowns. Fuck them and fuck their milk.&#34;

&gt; &#34;I went to the soup kitchens the other day because I got a bit peckish and didn&#39;t want to buy anything. Saw a lot of Italians there. We sure do live in a society.&#34;

&gt; &#34;When I was younger, my mother used to put a thermometer in my ass. I rather enjoyed that.&#34;

&gt; &#34;Saw a man kiss another man the other day. Awful brave of him.&#34;

&gt; &#34;They say it&#39;s a bad idea, but has anyone really //tried// to put cocaine up their ass?&#34;

&gt; &#34;I used to kill rats with a baseball bat. Still do. Just use a cricket bat now. Wider range.&#34;

&gt; &#34;What the fuck is cricket? One of them Irish sports?&#34;

&gt; &#34;You know those holes in the bottoms of barrels? Got my schlong stuck in one of them once.&#34;

&gt; &#34;You know what? Fuck Faeries. I oughta give them a whack with an iron bat if they don&#39;t shut up about being oppressed.&#34;

&gt; &#34;I met a gay robot today. Cool.&#34;

&gt; &#34;Gave Chester Williams a skull for his birthday. Didn&#39;t seem to like it. Shame. I liked that skull.&#34;

&gt; &#34;I met this stupid doctor guy, somehow he only spoke in lowercase letters. I don&#39;t know how that works, but he does. Fuck him anyways.&#34;

&gt; &#34;Hookers don&#39;t bleed if you freeze them first.&#34;

&gt; &#34;I remember when I was one of the Sea People. Got the gills and everything.&#34;

&gt; &#34;If you soak the bullets in whiskey, they scream longer.&#34;

&gt; &#34;Some dumbass served me thin-crust the other day. Said real pizza shouldn&#39;t have so much marinara. Now he don&#39;t have so much marinara in him anymore.&#34;

&gt; &#34;I went to a threesome one time. The girl never showed up. But Mama didn&#39;t raise no quitter.&#34;

&gt; &#34;Everybody always comes to tell me, &#39;ey, you see the boners in the paper today? fine stuff&#39; but buddy, I don&#39;t need no paper to check out some boners.&#34;

&gt; &#34;Why don&#39;t homeless people just buy a house?&#34;

&gt; &#34;Hey! I can wipe my own ass! Fuck off!&#34;

&gt; &#34;I had a goldfish. He&#39;s going to live forever. I know that because he never sinks to the bottom and drowns.&#34;

&gt; &#34;So, I was shooting up heroin behind the Spirit. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the end of the story.&#34;

&gt; &#34;You know who I hate? People without eyelids. Granted, I&#39;m usually the reason they don&#39;t have eyelids, but still.&#34;

&gt; &#34;Why don&#39;t orphans just buy a parent?&#34;

&gt; &#34;THERE WAS A PETTING ZOO YESTERDAY AND YOU DIDN&#39;T TELL ME?!&#34;

&gt; &#34;Listen, son, when I was your age, we didn&#39;t call a man who wanted to dress up like a coyote and have sex with another man dressed up like a bear a &#39;furry&#39;. We didn&#39;t call that man anything at all. That was just poker night.&#34;

&gt; &#34;Look, I&#39;m not gay, but a full set of adult human teeth is a full set of adult human teeth.&#34;

&gt; &#34;You kicked the wrong dicksucker!&#34;

&gt; &#34;Fuck the disabled, they&#39;re goddamn beautiful and horny as hell!&#34;

&gt; &#34;Saw a black man with a white woman today. The world is truly cruel. Why do the gals get all the good ones?&#34;

&gt; &#34;Do they still do full body bone replacements? My spine itches.&#34;

&gt; &#34;They call me Dick Chappell &#39;cause the whole congregation comes in to worship.&#34;

&gt; &#34;I tried to pet a cat today. It bit me. Now it lives in the river.&#34;

&gt; &#34;I don&#39;t get why people say cognitohazards are so bad. Like, just look away from the paper.&#34;

&gt; &#34;Psst, hey, guard, want to snort some crack?&#34;

&gt; &#34;I think I might be gay.&#34;
