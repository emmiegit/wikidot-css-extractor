**Item #:** SCP-239-DE

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-239-DE is to be held inside a cage furnished for rodents that fits the object&#39;s heightened urge to move and play. It should at least possess a size of 120x60x80 cm and be equipped with several climbing and playing supplies appropriate for its species. For hygienic purposes, a bowl with small animal bathing sand must be available. The furnishing is to be switched once per week to provide sufficient movement. Feeding is to be carried out with a special oil and flour seed mix specially designed for its species, with additional proteins and chopped fruits, dried berries, herbs, blossoms or nuts being granted as reward for proper behavior. A social interaction with staff is required daily to sustain the mental health of SCP-239-DE, and built and maintain a base of trust. Socializations with conspecifics is not possible, as the latter would either evade such situations or attack.

Every two days, SCP-239-DE is permitted access to a computer featuring a USB type A connector. Said computer may not be connected the local network, in order to mitigate eventual security breaches, and it is not to be provided with important or confidential documents. Care must always be taken that the programs and data inside the utilized computer are to be regularly switched to provide SCP-239-DE with adequate alternation.

**Appendix:** While SCP-239-DE inhabits a affiliated state, the name of PoI-0101-DE &#34;ParaNora&#34; shall not be named in any manner while close to the object to prevent potential theft, damage, or destruction of data. As a further security procedure, computers to which SCP-239-DE connects itself should feature no or at least a few visible icons on its desktop screen.


**Description:** SCP-239-DE describes a female Mongolian gerbil[[footnote]]//Meriones unguiculatus//; also known colloquially as the Mongolian jird.[[/footnote]] with yellowish-cream fur. 12 cm long from head to torso, it has a typical height for its species, but its weight of 200 g is unusually heavy, although this can not be seen from its appearance or behavior.

The tip of its tail is its most notable feature, on which a USB type A adapter in the same color as its fur is located. Despite this alteration, this does not appear to influence the movement or balance of SCP-239-DE.

Thorough body scans concluded that the majority of SCP-239-DE&#39;s inner body structure has been replaced with artificial, mostly electrical components.

[[collapsible show=&#34;List of notable modifications on SCP-239-DE&#34; hide=&#34;Close list&#34;]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

• Enhancement of the abdominal wall through additional fiber membrane to carry and stabilize the extra parts.

• Enhancement of the bones through a special polymer layer to ensure further protection and enable mobility

• The bones inside the paws have been replaced with artificial plastic joints that are able to carry the additional weight and do not limit movement.

• A metallic wire has been implemented through the tail, connecting the USB plug with the body.

• Parts of the brain have been replaced or extended via tiny nano chips to control the functions of the electric parts and enhance intelligence.

• The heart has been replaced with an electronic &#34;micromotor&#34;, increasing heart rate without overtaxing the body.

[[/div]]

[[/collapsible]]

Other organs such as liver, stomach or gastrointestinal track have not been replaced, so SCP-239-DE consumes a diet typical for its species. However, due to the heightened heartrate and bodily mass, its nutritional requirements are substantially higher than other members of the species. Additionally, these augmentations appear not to influence most of SCP-239-DE&#39;s senses in a positive nor negative way.

The sole exception hereby is the additional perception of electromagnetic waves emitted by computers it actively searches for. If SCP-239-DE finds a computer featuring a fitting USB adapter, it will connect to it by means of its tail to establish a link. In doing so, it draws electricity it regularly needs for its bodily functions. However, it will only do this on computers; attempts at connecting it with other sources of electricity, such as powersticks or connections with sockets, typically failed due to SCP-239-DE&#39;s reluctance. Longer periods without electrical nutrition are shown through dropping activity, more inert movements and slowing heart rate, possibly leading to the complete failure of the electronics and subsequent death of SCP-239-DE.

If connected, SCP-239-DE shows the ability to manipulate data inside the computer. It is able to click through folders, opening and closing programs, and load, edit, move, save, and delete files. This does not occur focused, however, but rather random, as if it clicks and moves everything curiously or simply for the sheer fun of it. It was also shown that it can save files from one computer that it finds interesting, and, if the need arises, load these onto another computer, comparable with gathering food for a storage chamber[[footnote]] Researchers assume SCP-239-DE to have been developed to steal files and manipulate computers, with the latter, however, failing due to the subject&#39;s arbitrariness and limited intelligence.[[/footnote]].

Researchers could determine that it is possible to communicate with SCP-239-DE per text and simple chat programs while it is in an connected state. However, it only understands and writes in simple sentences, and will not respond to commands aimed against it. Language tests concluded that it is thus able to understand easy sentences in German, English, Mandarin, Japanese, and Russian, and to communicate in these languages.

SCP-239-DE generally shows the usual demeanor of its conspefics. It is exceedingly active and curios, but, due to previous experiences, tends to show a shy behavior, partially preferring to retreat. Other conspefics evade SCP-239-DE and attempt to flee from it, whether through flight or aggressive behavior, deeming a socialization impossible. It is therefore dependent on social human contact.

**Discovery:** SCP-239-DE was discovered on the 01/11/2019 in Site-DE23 when researcher Michelsen wanted to edit the latest research results inside his bureau. He noticed that the mouse cursor moved on its own, the text file dispensing random numbers and letter sequences, and his file folder opened and closed without reason. He wanted to alarm the local system administration, as he suspected a hacking attack by hostile groups who assults the network, before discovering SCP-239-DE on his computer.

After SCP-239-DE noticed the discovery, it detached from the computer, and attempted to run away, but was caught by researcher Michelsen via a wastebasket that he pouted above the subject. Then, he alarmed the local security forces who contained SCP-239-DE, and transported it into its current secure area for further testing. To date, the origins of SCP-239-DE could not be determined. Later examinations of the security cameras concluded that it apparently breached the site through one of the ventilation systems leading outside. Following this incident, the security measures surrounding the latter have been improved and more tight ventilation grilles constructed.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Gaming experiments with SCP-239-DE&#34; hide=&#34;Close addendum&#34;]]

In order to review SCP-239-DE&#39;s willingness to learn and intelligence, as well as saturate its high need to play, several tests involving simple computer play opportunities have been approved. Before every game, SCP-239-DE will be informed about the respective game by a researcher per chat function.

Proposals for future tests require the strict inspection and subsequent approval of leading researcher Dr. Klunkelt.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]



[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Tested game:** Pong

**Result:** SCP-239-DE did not understand the concept of the game at first. For 3 minutes, it expressed difficulty in moving the character, until he tried to dodge the ball. After the researcher explained the game to the subject, it was able to precisely move the character, and play it within an hour in such a manner that it always hits the ball even at the highest difficulty. Following the game, it noted the game to be amusing, though, it would have preferred to play with a real ball instead, one that it could hold inside its paws.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Tested game:** Tetris[[footnote]]Game Boy-Version [[/footnote]]

**Result:** Akin to the latest test, SCP-239-DE showed difficulty to understand the game concept, losing the first four matches in a few minutes. After the concept has been clarified, it could built first lines, but initially showed problems in thinking strategically and moving and using blocks correctly. As the game progresses, it was able to arrange the figures more proficiently, and forms more lines. As a series of perfect 4 has been formed the first time, with the typical sound becoming audible thereafter, SCP-239-DE was scared so much that it cancelled the connection and wanted to run away. After having calmed down, it was able to proceed the game, but avoided to form rows of 4. SCP-239-DE reached the highest difficulty after a few attempts, continuously playing it, before braking off the attempt after 3 hours and 26 minutes.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Tested game:** Memory

**Result:** SCP-239-DE indiscriminately selected images for some minutes, without reaching a random match. It looked at some images again and again. To make progress, the goal of the game was explained. It was then able to play the game on the lower difficulties, though, still turning up random images, hoping to thus find matches. The higher the difficulty became and more images had to be found, the less successful it became at finding matches, increasing the subject&#39;s frustration, before cancelling the game by itself, and calling it „stupid“. It is to assumed that SCP-239-DE possesses problems with short-term memory.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Tested game:** Pac-Man[[footnote]]Atari-Version[[/footnote]]

**Result:** Initially, SCP-239-DE did not understand the concept of the game, but soon realized that it can move the Pac-Man character. It instinctively moved the character towards the cherry, though, without keeping sight of the enemy ghosts. As the orange ghost touched Pac Man and the figure in the game subsequently died, SCP-239-DE was scared so much it automatically broke off the game and attempted to find a hideout. It refused to proceed the game, as it was scared of the ghosts.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Tested game:** Minesweeper

**Result:** Despite understanding the game and its goal after an explanation, SCP-239-DE apparently lacked the required strategic understanding, thereby randomly clicking at boxes, hoping to find the right one. After one hour without wining one round, SCP-239-DE cancelled the game and seemed irritated. It since then refused to play the game again.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Tested game:** Candy Crush

**Result:** Due to the colorful and neatly looking images, SCP-239-DE showed a euphoric demeanor at first, but was visibly overwhelmed and excited. After the game was explained, it won the first level following several attempts, but showed signs of an epileptic seizure with short brakes of consciousness, increased heart rate and limb twitching in the first hour of playing. It reacted to requests with aggression, stating to only be able to perceive anything other than crazy colors. The test was thereupon subsequently terminated, and SCP-239-DE was brought into its containment chamber for recovery, while defending itself via threatening gestures, biting and clawing, before tiredly getting stuck, slightly twitching. After two days of observed containment and controlled energy nutrition, SCP-239-DE recovered from its epileptic seizure. Several requests by the subject to continue the game were denied by D. Kunkelt for health reasons.
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Tested game:** The Maze Game[[footnote]]An alleged game of skill in which a dot is to be moved through a labyrinth via keyboard. It was later revealed to have been a „prank game“, where the player is scared in the midst of the labyrinth. [[/footnote]]

**Note:** The game has been proposed by Dr. Vene. At the time of the test, the leading researcher was not aware that it was a prank by Dr. Vene.

**Result:** [DATA REMOVED]

**Addendum 1:** „You&#39;re an asshole, Dr. Vene.“ - Leading researcher Dr. Klunkelt[[footnote]]Dr. Klunkelt was admonished due to this unprofessional statement. [[/footnote]]

**Addendum 2:** Congratulation, Dr. Vene. You almost discovered a method to terminate SCP-239-DE. We were lucky that we were able to medically stabilize it in time after the scare and it did not suffer a heart attack. The heart had the double the normal rate! You were lucky that it recovered after a week, but we cannot exclude any lasting damage on SCP-239-DE. Not to mention the psychological aftermath, and that it no longer has the courage to connect to the previous computer. I don&#39;t care if this was just meant to be a joke, and that Dr. Klunkelt was the actual aim. Clean your desk and report for amnestic treatment. As of now, you are no longer a part of the foundation.“ – O4-█

**Appendix:** After SCP-239-DE has dispensed the numeral code, the chat screen minimized and a locked file of unknown origin appeared at the desktop, named „ParaNora Box“. The cursor of the computer shifted into a moveable pixel figure akin to SCP-239-DE. Attempts by Dr. Klunkelt to move this figure via computer mouse or keyboard, write something in the chat, or to control the computer in other ways failed[[footnote]] She later stated that she did not want to turn off or disconnect the computer to evade possible damages to SCP-239-DE.[[/footnote]]. The mouse cursor, later designated as SCP-239-DE-1, independently moves around the desktop towards the symbols located thereon, picking them up, and gathering them in a folder, while also ignoring even administrative authorizations or encryptions with passwords and the like. After having moved all symbols in this manner, SCP-239-DE-1 opens the chat history, whose integrity was in such bad state after being touched that it seemed like the chat window has been gnawed. Following the first chat window&#39;s destruction, SCP-239-DE moved to the folder, picked it up, and disappeared with it in the bottom right border of the screen, before the computer crashed due to a error message of unknown origin, shutting himself down.

Following these incidents, SCP-239-DE was unconscious for several minutes, and showed an increased heart rate. After half an hour inside the site&#39;s veterinary station, the condition of the object bettered, and it regained consciousness. During later questionings, it stated to not be aware of what happened to it, claiming to have simply fallen asleep during a „boring game“ and later awoke inside the station.

Examinations on the affected computer revealed that all files that initially had symbols on the desktop were missing, including all saving and editing data existing inside the computer. Furthermore, the wastebasket and the mouse cursor, wherefore files could not be deleted or moved via the mouse. Files not existing as symbols on the desktop were not affected. Searching for the missing files, SCP-239-DE and the folder respectively, was unsuccessful. If the files have been stolen, deleted, or destroyed, the exact nature of the folder in which the files disappeared, and if they are located inside the internal storage of SCP-239-DE is currently subject to further research.

Due to its potential risk of data theft, SCP-239-DE has been reclassified from &#34;Safe&#34; to &#34;Euclid&#34;.
