    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>A man entered the office, illuminated by white lamps, completely isolated from the outside world and protected by anomalous and non-anomalous means. He was very nervous but tried not to show it; there was nothing in the office except a camera, several documents and an electronic board. This man, researcher Jason, was recently entrusted with a project of no small, but far from paramount importance. Little did he know that this would turn into him highlighting the possibility of a Class K event in front of the Overseer Council.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Dr. Jason:** Hello, thank you for taking the time to listen to me.

[Jason turned on the electronic screen as he spoke to the camera. He had considerable reputation within the Foundation, but he couldn&#39;t afford to waste the time of someone so high-ranking. He opened the document, simultaneously displaying an electronic copy of it on the screen.]

**Dr. Jason:** Let&#39;s get straight to the point. As you all know, my project to study black holes was recently approved. Using new technologies, we were able to send a drone equipped with artificial intelligence into a black hole, with enough power to move freely inside and even capture objects. 

[Jason pressed the button and the drawings of the drone were displayed on the screen; several anomalous objects had to be used to create it.]

**Dr. Jason:** I expected that this would lead to more information about the nature of black holes, or even the possibility of time travel. However, the project was closed after only 3 tests; it brought absolutely no results. The drone was unable to measure or capture anything. 

[Jason fell silent for a few seconds, he remembered the disappointment he felt when his project could not bring any benefit. After a moment of silence, he pressed the button, displaying a new document and continuing his speech.]

**Dr. Jason:** Or rather, that&#39;s what we thought until now. A few days ago, researcher Gregor, one of the best in the narrativistic department, raised the ears of the entire department, demanding to contact me immediately.

[Jason still didn&#39;t fully understand why he decided to contact him. Just because it is his project, or because he has a greater reputation and it will be easier for him to convey information to the very top of the Foundation? Rather, all at once.]

**Dr. Jason:** While studying the most elementary component of the world, concepts, it was noticed that our reality is unstructured and chaotic. The concepts of our reality were going crazy, as if someone had hit them with all their might, setting them in motion, forcing them to change chaotically. This has never been seen before.

[The new slide reflected on the screen before Jason continued. He himself did not fully understand narrativist and spoke without fully understanding the meaning of the words.]

**Dr. Jason:** Upon further study, a starting point was noticed. It all started with the concept of mathematics, it was there that the concepts behaved especially “chaotically”. Here we return to my project. It turned out that the drone was still able to capture something.

[The screen displayed the complex structure of the concept, an attempt to recreate something so abstract as a physical model.]

**Dr. Jason:** What the drone captured is the number 8. I don&#39;t mean a structure in the form of the number 8 or something like that. The very concept of &#34;8&#34;. Now this may seem crazy to you, but never before before this event did “8” exist, and I’m not talking about “8” as a symbol, I’m talking about it as a number. Just imagine that you take 4 pencils, add 4 more to them and get 9 pencils. Now it is even impossible to imagine due to the fact that our reality has “adapted” to this concept.

[This was not discovered immediately; no one would have thought that the measurements made by the drone should be transferred to the hands of the departments of metaphysics and pataphysics.]

**Dr. Jason:** However, this could not remain without consequences. Everyone here has long been familiar with “narrative”; it has long become a necessary part of the Foundation. The concept captured by the drone was taken from somewhere disproportionately higher. This was not a difference of one narrative, this concept was taken from somewhere beyond all narratives. Somehow, the drone that went into the black hole was able to take a concept from somewhere where concepts should not exist in principle.

[The new document was displayed on the screen. This was an explanation of the work of narratives, something that not everyone fully understands, and those who think that they still understand are even more mistaken.]

**Dr. Jason:** Then, paying attention to this, it was discovered that Black Holes are in fact not some kind of “supermassive objects” as was always thought before. No, these are breaks in space leading somewhere into the abyss, an abyss that contains all the concepts that cannot be understood by the logic of narratives. Concepts of mathematical structures have been found that are both superior to and part of mathematics. This was quickly abandoned due to the extremely high danger of &#34;realizing&#34; something that should not be realized. As one of the researchers explained to me, imagine that you have a plate. This is an ordinary plate, you are aware of it as an object on which you put food, a physical object. That abyss contains the very concept that the plate is a complex mathematical structure. Or an object containing a larger number of coordinates than mathematics can in principle describe. Or the concept that the plate is food that grows on trees. If there are any concepts in the next narrative, this abyss also contains everything that goes beyond this concept. 

[It was difficult to imagine or describe. How can you even describe this in more detail? How to describe something for which there is no concept at all?]

**Dr. Jason:** Returning to our topic, moving the concept of &#34;8&#34; into our reality has led to a serious disruption. Mathematics began to adapt to the new concept, which was impossible without more concepts that should never have been in our reality, which entailed the movement of even more similar concepts into our reality, which increasingly disrupted its structure. In addition, by also changing the way we perceive the world, it affected the lower realities that we consider as fiction. As a result, all concepts that were previously outside the narratives were moved to the very bottom of the narrative structure.

[He paused for a couple of seconds, hoping that they realized the full scale of the problem.]

**Dr. Jason:** If it all stopped there, it would be large-scale but would not lead to the consequences that we have now. Concepts that go beyond the logic of all narratives became part of the narratives and were realized, which led to the creation of even more concepts in this abyss, which were also realized. This created an endless chain of creating ever more absurd and chaotic concepts. Our world already contains concepts, structures and objects that just a couple of moments ago could not be realized by any narrative, which is why all the narratives above and below also received them. Such endless creation of concepts and structures has already entailed the creation of 37 new “black holes” in the observable universe. At this rate, our reality will be destroyed due to a violation of its structure. I insist that all the Foundation&#39;s resources be redirected to solving this problem.

He left it at that, hoping that they would be able to avoid the threat.</textarea></pre>
