| caption=A taxidermied instance of SCP-6193-B located at the Haus der Natur in Salzburg, Austria[[footnote]]Although this would typically constitute a serious breach in security, as the residents and employees all believe SCP-6193-B to be a hoax, no action is to be taken at this time.[[/footnote]].]]
[[/&gt;]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-6193 are to be stored in a standard large biological containment cell at Site-233. Each instance is to be fed a modified Standard Small Omnivore diet, with all plant matter being sourced directly from herbs and roots in Bavarian forests. A joint Biological-Folkloric study is to be performed by the Cryptozoology Department and the Department of Mythology and Folklore. Changes in the behavior of any SCP-6193 instance is to be reported to the Head Researcher of SCP-6193. Any new instances of SCP-6193 reported in Bavaria are to be captured and contained using procedure ARTEMIS-78. 

As information of SCP-6193 is widely available knowledge, SCP-6193 is instead to be portrayed as a hoax created by the Bavarian locals to trick unsuspecting travelers.

**Description:** SCP-6193 is the designation for 6 chimeric entities, originally located in the German state of Bavaria. SCP-6193 is colloquially known as the Wolpertinger or Woiperdinger. When a human being comes into contact with any instance of SCP-6193, large patches of hair will sprout near the area of contact. SCP-6193 instances are typically docile and generally avoid human contact, outside of female personnel that are romantically uninvolved. 3 Distinct versions of SCP-6193 exist: SCP-6193-A, -B, and -C. 

SCP-6193-A&#39;s body visually resembles a //Lepus europaeus//[[footnote]]European Hare[[/footnote]]. However, SCP-6193-A contains many features not typically present in //L. europaeus//, including: 
* Wings belonging to a //Coturnix coturnix//[[footnote]]Common Quail[[/footnote]] 
* Antlers similar to that of a male //Capreolus capreolus//[[footnote]]Roe Deer[[/footnote]]
* Long, sharpened canine teeth
* The back legs and feet of a //Somateria mollissima//[[footnote]]Eider Duck[[/footnote]]
* Scent glands, similar to that of a //Spilogale putorius//[[footnote]] Eastern Spotted Skunk[[/footnote]] located underneath the tail. [[footnote]]Of note is that //S. putorius// is not native to Bavaria.[[/footnote]]

SCP-6193-B instances all appear to be primarily bipedal //Vulpes vulpes// [[footnote]] Red Foxes[[/footnote]] with white fur. All instances of SCP-6193-B have the bill and facial structure (with the exception of the ears) of a //Somateria mollissima//. SCP-6193-B instances also have small horn-like structures on their heads, not representative of any known species.

The singular SCP-6193-C instance contained by the Foundation has a long, quadrupedal form, similar to that of a //Martes martes// [[footnote]]European Pine Marten[[/footnote]], covered in the feathers of a //Phasianus colchicus// [[footnote]]Common Pheasant[[/footnote]]. The face of SCP-6193 is avian in structure, with an ocular similar to that of //M. martes//. SCP-6193&#39;s tail is that of //Equus africanus asinus//[[footnote]]Domestic Donkey[[/footnote]], unlike the rest of its body.

**Addendum 6193.1: Discovery and Analysis** 
[[/=]]

Knowledge of SCP-6193 dates back to approximately 1982, when Foundation Researcher Lucas Schmidt reported seeing one in his home country of Bavaria. Due to SCP-6193&#39;s then-unknown anomalous properties, SCP-6193 was unable to be captured and remained uncontained. 

However, due to increased reported sightings of SCP-6193 in 2011, a joint initiative between   
the Cryptozoology Department and the Department of Mythology and Folklorics was formed.  The following transcript is an annotated Folkloric/Cryptozoological analysis of a Bavarian folk tale about SCP-6193.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**In the forests of Bavaria, a roebuck and a hare mate, thus birthing the first Wolpertinger.**

-//Likely not a literal mating, as this would be biologically impossible.// Dr. Rifan

-//This could however imply that SCP-6193-A was created intentionally by something and based on a roe deer and a hare.// Dr. Howards

**Their union inspired many other creatures to do so as well: a fox and a duck, and a pheasant and a pine marten.**

-//Yet again, likely not literal.// Dr. Rifan

-//This could mean that whatever created SCP-6193-A found it to be a success, and created more, -B and -C.// Dr. Howards 

**The Wolpertingers have lived in the secluded woodland ever since, feeding on its plants and insects and only showing themselves to certain people.** 

-//This shows an omnivorous diet, meaning — at least in the case of -A and -C — a modified digestive system.// Dr. Rifan

-//Of note is them only showing themselves for certain people. This would imply some sort of precognition or sixth sense.// Dr. Howards

**If you wish to summon a Wolpertinger, an attractive maiden must enter the woods accompanied by a man during the full moon. If the Wolpertinger deems the man &#34;right&#34; it will reveal itself to the two.**

-//This could show some possible cathemerality by SCP-6193, as we know they&#39;re active in the daytime.// Dr. Rifan.

-//Currently, we don&#39;t know how the Wolpertinger deems the man &#34;right&#34;, but is implied to do with romantic compatibility. While we don&#39;t understand the significance of these details yet, they work, as demonstrated by procedure ARTEMIS-78 (detailed below).// Dr. Howards

**Addendum 6193.2: Procedure ARTEMIS-78** 
[[/=]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Materials:**
* One (1) Security Clearance Level 3 personnel, identifying as female, that is not currently in a romantic relationship (hereafter referred to as &#34;maiden&#34;). 
* One (1) Security Clearance Level 2 personnel, identifying as male, that has a knowledge of the Bavarian woodlands, and is found to be romantically appealing to the maiden. (hereafter referred to as &#34;man&#34;).
* One (1) wax candlestick located inside of a brass candlestick holder (hereafter referred to as &#34;candle&#34;)
* One (1) large burlap sack (hereafter referred to as &#34;sack&#34;)
* One (1) small piece of wood, approximately one (1) meter in length and no more than ten (10) centimeters in diameter. (hereafter referred to as &#34;stick&#34;)
* One (1) medium sized shovel with a head composed primarily of steel (hereafter referred to as &#34;spade&#34;)
-----
# On the date of the full moon, the man and the maiden are to go out into the woods near the sighting of SCP-6193, equipped with the candle, sack, stick, and spade.
# The man is to lead the maiden into a clearing, no less than 50 meters from the woodline
# The maiden is then to place the sack on the ground, and place the stick in such a position so that it holds the sack upright.
# The maiden is then to light the candle, and place it within the sack.
# At this point an instance of SCP-6193 may or may not appear. If it does not, the procedure is to be terminated and retried next full moon, using a different maiden and/or man.
# If an instance of SCP-6193 does appear, the man is to wait until SCP-6193 enters the sack. Upon this happening, the man will drive the instance into the sack using the spade.
# The maiden is then to tie up the bag and carry SCP-6193 into Foundation custody.

**Addendum 6193.3: Note**
[[/=]]
On 4/30/2002, a note appeared in SCP-6193&#39;s enclosure overnight. Security footage in the enclosure found no irregularities until 23:46, when an unidentified figure entered and left the note. It is unknown how the figure entered the enclosure as the cameras outside of SCP-6193&#39;s enclosure had unexpectedly stopped working at this time. The note left has been recorded below. 

&gt; So this is where these ended up. Thank you for taking care of them.
