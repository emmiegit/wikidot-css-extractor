[[tab Editorial]]
**From the Editorial Desk -**

Welcome to the new and improved Site News feed! We&#39;re excited to introduce a bunch of new features, as well as an entirely new look and feel. Over the last few months we&#39;ve been trying to increase the visibility of the Site News in an effort to bring more attention to some of the incredible work coming out across the SCP Foundation Wiki community.

The Site News has always been a vehicle to not only showcase the month&#39;s work, but also to provide an informative look at the entirety of the SCP Wiki community as a whole. In an effort to do that, we&#39;ve added a new section called &#34;Staff Spotlight&#34;, where we&#39;ll be bringing you interviews from members of all the different SCP Wiki staff teams. Last month we highlit Forum Crit and interviewed cybersqyd. This month we&#39;re targeting Licensing with an interview with Naepic. 

As we move forward, the Editorial section will include blog posts from the various members of the Site News team, discussing various aspects of the site and covering some of the goings on behind the scenes. While we&#39;ve always had [http://05command.wikidot.com/ 05 Command] as a way to maintain transparency about what Staff is up to, there has always been a disconnect between the Staff and the general wiki community. This is an effort to bridge that disconnect and to give our readers more information about who we are as staff and fellow members of the SCP Wiki community.

As we continue to get more feedback from the community on what does and does not work as a way of generating effective communication, you might begin to see more new things, so stay tuned.

-----
With a huge thank you from the entire Site News team:
**Editors:** TSATPWTCOTTTADC &amp; MalyceGraves
**Reporters:** Naepic, The Pighead, WhiteGuard, DrAkimoto, Edna_Granbo, Hexick, &amp; Limeyy

You will notice little &#39;📈&#39; emojis beside some articles. That denotes SCP articles which were under 30 and tales which were under 20 when this edition of site news was posted. Give them a little love! Speaking from personal experience, the most frustrating thing that can happen to an article is not deletion, but stagnating below 20 without any comments. So try to read, vote, and comment on these articles! They&#39;re often hidden gems :)

[[tab Staff Spotlight]]
**March spotlight:** [http://05command.wikidot.com/license-experts-main Licensing Staff Team]
**Featuring:** Naepic
**Interviewer:** WhiteGuard

------

Howdy, Naepic! Let&#39;s start with one of our mutual teams. Why does the wiki have a Licensing team? What are some of its functions and some of the things you do personally?

&gt; Well, it&#39;s mostly just &#34;if we don&#39;t do this, who will?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; A lot of the visible work on the wiki is managed by the Images team, which is effectively a subteam of Licensing, and we essentially work alongside Tag Team to ensure new articles have CC compliant images. Aside from that, Licensing serves as the closest thing the wiki has to a legal team, and does consultation on what is and isn&#39;t okay to put on a writing site - and for good measure: we don&#39;t want to be sued. As for me, I mostly just quietly man down the fort involving the new articles tagged _image, lurk in #site34, and skim over the work that was done on the EN wiki in purging images so we can (eventually) provide a list to the INT branches on what to axe.

How did you end up on Licensing? As you have risen in the ranks as staff, has your role within the team changed at all?

&gt; To this day, I still don&#39;t know why or how Procy decided to pick me up. Maybe he was inebriated, maybe he was too sober. But effectively, Crashington and I were shitting doing who knows what and we stumbled upon some SCP products that weren&#39;t attributed properly. When we went to report it, we started noticing more stuff and kept reporting it. Either Procy got impressed or wanted us to shut up because he made us Licensing JS on the spot.
&gt; 
&gt; As I&#39;ve risen up, I&#39;ve mostly taken a more quiet role, mostly because my claim to fame - mass culling images - is a thing of the past now. The EN wiki is almost clean, those days of image hunting are fondly remembered, but no longer here. For now, I just stick to hawking over the _image tag for any new articles and mentor the new generation of Licensing staff.

Alrighty, so we have talked extensively about images on site, but not as much about the license. We are licensed under a Creative Commons license, but not all CC licenses are compatible. What is our license, and why is it that I can not sell SCP merch under say a CC BY-NC 4.0?

&gt; Right, here we go.
&gt; 
&gt; So the wiki&#39;s license is Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 3.0, or CC BY-SA 3.0. What this means is that all content on the wiki falls under that license, and all content made from SCP stuff needs to be compliant with that license.
&gt; 
&gt; CC BY-SA 3.0 lets you do whatever the heck you want provided you follow two, simple rules. One: attribute anything you use. This includes assets, drawings, stories, whatever. Don&#39;t skimp out with just a link, either. Make sure to make it clear who it is your content is being derived from. Two: whatever you make with those CC stuff also needs to be released under a license that is compatible.
&gt; 
&gt; What does compatibility mean? Well, effectively, it means you can&#39;t add restrictions to how your content is used. If you were to, say, sell a plushie of SCP-682, as long as you make it clear that SCP-682 is by whoever wrote the article, and includes the Creative Commons release license, neither I nor the author of 682 can stop you from selling it.
&gt; 
&gt; This goes both ways, however. If you make artwork of SCP-096 and someone likes it and reposts it or even sells it as a T-shirt, as long as they follow proper CC protocols, you can&#39;t restrict them from doing so.
&gt; 
&gt; That&#39;s why Creative Commons licenses that include -NC or -ND can&#39;t be used. Non-commercial, or NC, licenses place the restriction that you can&#39;t make money off of that content. Non-derivative, or ND, licenses prohibit you from altering that content in any way. Both of these qualify as additional restrictions and aren&#39;t compatible with CC BY-SA 3.0.

Sweet. So, breaking away from staff work for a moment. You were part of the recent batch who were promoted to Moderator. Congrats on that of course. How does it feel to be a Mod? Has anything really changed for you?

&gt; Thanks!
&gt; 
&gt; It feels... quiet. I never expected to be here, much less so put up for promotions. It&#39;s given me the confidence to be more vocal during staff discussions sure, and I get asked to do some stuff that only moderators and above can do occasionally, like unlocking metadata and whatnot. But aside from that, life&#39;s more or less the same.

Alright, so to round things out, we don&#39;t really get a lot of time to read and enjoy things on the site as much whenever we are swamped with staff work. With that being said, when you have had the time, have you gotten the chance to read anything recently that you really happened to enjoy?

&gt; I tend to avoid reading new articles because I don&#39;t want to become attached to them should I ever have to speak to the author about images.
&gt; 
&gt; That said, I did enjoy the sequel to Tanhony&#39;s Among Us SCP. I know it caused quite a lot of commotion when the original came out, so when people went ballistic over the sequel, I figured I should check it out myself.

Pretty cool. Alright, that should do it. Thanks for doing this with me!

&gt; No problem, thanks for having me!

**Staff News:**

This month, we introduced 4 new Junior Staff members to the fold: Vivarium, Sirslash47, Zoobeeny, and Cyvstvi13.

Moderator aismallard has taken up the mantle and started back up our monthly &#34;Good Noodles&#34; which is where Junior Staff are recognized for performing their duties in a manner that the captain wishes to acknowledge in a space where all other staff can see. This month&#39;s set of [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-9491946/the-good-noodles-spotlight &#34;Good Noodles&#34;] includes:

Long-time moderator A Random Day officially [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-1750328/away-random-day retired] ending his 5-year long stint as part of staff.

Administrator Modern_Erasmus opened up the new [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-14018096/rewrite-request-thread Rewrite Request Thread] to be the new place to request rewrites for low rated pages under staff purview, as well as for all rewrites of works that a prolific SCP author and former community member recently bequeathed to the SCP Wiki community to remix and revitalize.

Moderator aismallard initiated the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14021257/voting-thread:adult-page-guide vote] on the //Adult Page Guide// discussion. This vote was to create [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/adult-page-guide this page] as an official site guide and memorialize this as the procedure for creating adult pages on the SCP-EN. It was passed unanimously and implemented.

Moderator aismallard initiated the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14021317/voting-thread:first-class-themes-proposal vote] on the //First-Class Themes Proposal//. This vote was for theme pages to be created as standalone creative works similar to tales, SCP articles, and other pages on the wiki since they are created by users and already both require Tech Team approval as part of the CSS Policy, and are subject to deletion like any other page. It was passed with a vote of 19 in favor and 6 against and implemented.

Moderator UraniumEmpire initiated the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14030064/discussion:overhauling-introductions discussion] on the //Overhauling Introductions// proposal. The discussion brought up the issue that the introductions subteam for Community Outreach faces in it&#39;s current form and sought to create a better way for them to function. The discussion will continue, but has been put on hold at the moment.

Moderator Croquembouche initiated the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14031824/proposal:new-category-for-pages-listing-works-by-an-author discussion] on the //New category for pages listing works by an author proposal// which would create a category for pages that provide links to more works by a given author. It was passed unanimously and implemented.

Operational Staff WhiteGuard carried out the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14037151/inactive-staff-retirement Inactive Staff Retirement] which oversaw the automatic retirement of 35 long inactive members from staff.

+* Q&amp;A:

++++* Q: Can I replace a blurb that you wrote for one of my articles with my own? I&#39;m not satisfied with it.

A: Absolutely. You will always have that option at any point.

++++* Q: I noticed an error/typo/incorrect information and wish to correct it. May I?

A: Sure! If the changes are not limited to your own article(s) and/or are substantial changes across multiple entries, you should post in that month&#39;s discussion page and then make the changes.

++++* Q: I wrote an article and it seems to have stuck. Can I send a blurb of mine to one of the frequent collaborators?

A: Yup! It&#39;s much easier if you come to us about it, and it gives you the control over what you want shown on the news page.
