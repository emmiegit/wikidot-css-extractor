**Foreword:** //The following recording was recovered from Daryl Abram&#39;s broken cellular device, located beneath the passenger seat of a 2008 Nissan Versa S. It was later archived following the conclusion of [[[/my-thoughts-are-not-my-own|Missing Persons Investigation #1626]]].//

**{{&lt;BEGIN RECORDING, [0:11]&gt;}}**
 
**[VOICE 1]** - Oh, hi! Hey. I know you&#39;re probably busy and all that -- I just wanted to give you a quick call. About later, I mean. Whenever you have the time; if you just want to pick us up at home, I can arrange something--

**[VOICE 2]** - //(Offhand)// Mommy, who are you talking to?

**[VOICE 1]** - Your Dad, honey.

**[VOICE 2]** - //(Offhand)// Oh! Can I please say hi to him? Pretty, //pretty// please?

**[VOICE 1]** - //(Chuckling)// Yes Jaden. Come say hi.

//Several seconds pass.//

**[VOICE 2]** - Hi Daddy! I miss you.

**[VOICE 1]** - Jaden, honey, this is a voicemail. Your Daddy is busy right now.

**VOICE 2]** - Voicemail?

**[VOICE 1]** - Yeah, honey. Voicemail.

**[VOICE 2]** - Oh!

//A pause.//

**[VOICE 1]** - Why don&#39;t you talk about what happened today?

**[VOICE 2]** - Today? Um...

//Silence for an additional several seconds.//

**[VOICE 2]** - Should I talk about school first? //(Giggles)//

**[VOICE 1]** - No, no. What did we do at the store today?

**[VOICE 2]** - Uh... you tripped on the sidewalk?

**[VOICE 1]** - No! //(Laughing)// The toy store.

**[VOICE 2]** - Oh, I know! That was just really funny though when it happened, Mommy.

//The two voices laugh simultaneously.//

**[VOICE 2]** - Mommy bought me an outfit! //(Giggling)// It&#39;s really, really cute.

**[VOICE 1]** - That outfit wasn&#39;t for you, silly. Who was it for? Do you remember?

**[VOICE 2]** - It was for Mr. Wooflestuckins!

**[VOICE 1]** - That&#39;s right! Your blue teddy bear, the one on your bed.

**[VOICE 2]** - Yeah! //(Giggles)//

**[VOICE 1]** - You wanna tell Daddy what the outfit looks like?

**[VOICE 2]** - Yeah! Uh... it&#39;s red and blue, and it looks like Superman! It&#39;s got a really long thingy on the back too.

**[VOICE 1]** - A cape, Jaden.

**[VOICE 2]** - Yeah! A cape. I forgot. //(Laughs)//

**[VOICE 1]** - Why don&#39;t you tell your Dad why you got it? What you said to me in the car?

**[VOICE 2]** - Um...

//Another pause.//

**[VOICE 1]** - Go ahead honey, don&#39;t be shy.

**[VOICE 2]** - Well... I got it because it reminded me of Daddy. Mommy said you spent a whole lot of time at work. She said that you were really busy today and that you really wanted to come get me after preschool but couldn&#39;t. I asked Mommy to buy it so I could always, always, //always// remember you! //(Giggles)//

**[VOICE 1]** - Aw, that&#39;s right. Good job!

//Voice 2 continues giggling for several seconds.//

**[VOICE 1]** - Hey silly goose, where are you going?

**[VOICE 2]** - //(Offhand)// To put on Mr. Wooflestuckin&#39;s new outfit!

**[VOICE 1]** - Didn&#39;t you forget to say something to Dad?

**[VOICE 2]** - //(Offhand)// Oh right.

//Another pause.//

**[VOICE 2]** - I love you! Have a good day at work. See you later!

//Voice 2 can be heard walking away.//

**[VOICE 1]** - What a silly girl... what are we gonna do with her?

//Voice 1 sighs.//

**[VOICE 1]** - Y&#39;know, she loves you a lot. Truly. Every day she tells me exactly how much she loves you.

**[VOICE 1]** - I know you&#39;re really busy. With what&#39;s happening at work and all, I know you&#39;re stressed. Do me a favor, okay? Don&#39;t worry. Especially not about us. You keep doing what you need to, and everything will work out. I promise, Daryl.

//A final pause.//

**[VOICE 1]** - Oh, and don&#39;t you worry about Jaden. She&#39;ll be thrilled to hear about her new baby sister on the way. Stay safe, we can&#39;t wait to see you.
