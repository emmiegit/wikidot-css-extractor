**SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** SCP-7661 is to be contained in Site-56&#39;s Vehicle Containment Garage. Instances of SCP-7661-A are to be apprehended and contained in standard humanoid chambers at Site-56.

Foundation assets are to monitor road traffic collision data to predict the creation of new SCP-7661-A instances. Newly created instances are to be retrieved from SCP-7661, interviewed, then transported to containment.

**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-7661 is a 2002 Nissan X-terra sports utility vehicle consistent with those produced at the Nissan Smyrna Assembly Plant in Tennessee, USA. No records exist of its manufacture; a plaque reading &#34;Courtesy Vehicle&#34; is located where the windshield VIN plate would be. SCP-7661 otherwise operates similarly to a non-anomalous automobile. 

SCP-7661 will undergo an anomalous event when any 2002 Nissan X-terra is involved in a road traffic collision in which the driver is terminated as a direct result. An exact duplicate of the driver, designated SCP-7661-A, will manifest within SCP-7661 between 21 and 37 hours following the driver’s death. All instances of SCP-7661-A are physically and genetically identical to their terminated counterpart and possess memories that the latter would have.

//A yellow Nissan X-terra SUV approaches the intersection. Its left indicator is blinking as it stops at the crosswalk.//

//Multiple oncoming cars pass by as the SUV idles in place.//

//The traffic signal facing the SUV turns yellow. An oncoming bus stops at the intersection, yielding to the vehicle.//

//The SUV begins to accelerate, turning left.//

//An oncoming speeding coupe swerves around the bus and collides with the SUV head-on. The force of the impact pushes the SUV backwards a few meters.//

//The two vehicles come to rest as the SUV&#39;s horn blares. Multiple onlookers begin to walk towards the damaged vehicles in an attempt to provide assistance.//

//A pedestrian approaches the driver’s side of the SUV and looks inward before reaching in.//

//The horn ceases blaring.//

//The pedestrian steps back from the wreckage and begins to solicit additional help from the surrounding crowd.//

//Epsilon-33 agents Timothy Polot, Stacy Stafford, and Clezheimer Nelson approach the house. They are dressed in Kyuzhevitz Police uniforms. Two more agents are preparing to load SCP-7661 onto a Foundation flatbed tow truck.//

**POLOT:** Alright team, one last reminder. Repeat after me: &#34;Mackenzie Macrada&#34;.

**STAFFORD and NELSON:** Mackenzie Macrada.

**POLOT:** &#34;Accident investigation.&#34;

**STAFFORD and NELSON:** Accident investigation. 

//The three agents take deep breaths as Agent Polot knocks on the front door.//

**POLOT:** Kyuzhevitz Police Department! We have some questions for a &#34;Mrs. Macrada&#34;.

//The door opens to reveal an elderly woman.//

**WOMAN:** Hello?

**POLOT:** Hello, ma&#39;am. We need to talk to Mackenzie about the accident she was in about a week ago.

**WOMAN:** What do you mean? She&#39;s completely fine. I... I thought I lost her, but...

**NELSON:** Right, but there&#39;s been... a discrepancy over who&#39;s at fault, so we&#39;re here to ask her more about it.

**WOMAN:** Um... alright then. 

//The woman turns around. Behind her, a young boy and girl are visible.//

**WOMAN:** Mackenzie! The police are here to ask you about that accident!

//SCP-7661-A-1 peers from around a corner.//

**SCP-7661-A-1:** That&#39;s odd... cops?

//SCP-7661-A-1 walks towards the front door as the elderly woman and children watch.//

**POLOT:** Hello, Mrs. Macrada. We need you to come down to the station to discuss that accident you were involved in. Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re not under arrest or anything.

**SCP-7661-A-1:** Oh... the accident. 

**NELSON:** It&#39;s just gonna take a couple hours. It&#39;s... for insurance purposes. 

**SCP-7661-A-1:** Um... okay, officers. 

//The two children begin to approach SCP-7661-A-1.//

**BOY:** Mom, mom, why are the police taking you?

//SCP-7661-A-1 kneels down to eye level with the children as the agents watch silently.//

**SCP-7661-A-1:** They just need to talk to me about the accident last week, Dustin.

**GIRL:** But Mommy, you&#39;re okay!

**SCP-7661-A-1:** Oh Rachel, it&#39;s just... adult stuff. I&#39;ll explain when you&#39;re older. 

**STAFFORD:** Um... Miss, we&#39;re on a bit of a tight schedule...

**SCP-7661-A-1:** Oh, I see. //&lt;to the children&gt;// I&#39;ll be back soon, stay put with Grandma.

//The children attempt to hug SCP-7661-A-1, but are blocked by Agent Polot.//

**POLOT:** Don&#39;t worry kids, your mother will be back soon. 

**BOY:** Oh... okay, officer. 

**GIRL:** //&lt;waving to SCP-7661-A-1&gt;// Bye, mommy!

//SCP-7661-A-1 waves back as it exits the house and is escorted by Agent Nelson to the Foundation-borrowed police cruiser.//

//Agent Polot exchanges glances with Agent Stafford.//

//Stafford nods, and the two face the elderly woman as the children watch.//

**POLOT:** While my partner takes Mackenzie in, we need to ask you some more questions. Mind if we come in?

**WOMAN:** What kind of questions?

//As Agent Polot recites his answers, Agent Stafford approaches the children.//

**BOY:** Officer, when&#39;s our mom gonna be done with the questions?

**GIRL:** When will Mommy come back?

//Agent Stafford does not respond.//

**BOY:** Officer?

//The elderly woman becomes agitated with Agent Polot.//

**WOMAN:** Sir, I //do not// understand why you need to enter my home.

//Agent Polot remains silent as he takes out his can of Class-B aerosol amnestics from his pocket. The woman notices.//

**WOMAN:** What... what is that?

//Agent Polot administers the amnestics in the elderly woman&#39;s face.//

//The woman&#39;s mouth opens agape as she breathes in the amnestics. Stafford and the children gasp as they watch.//

**BOY:** G- Grandma? What are you doing to my grandma?

**GIRL:** //Grandma!//

//Agent Polot turns around towards Agent Stafford and the children, who appear distressed. Polot runs towards them, amnestics can in hand.//

**BOY:** What did you do to-

//Agent Polot sprays the amnestic aerosol can in the boy&#39;s face. The girl begins to cry.//

//Agent Stafford steps back as Polot administers the amnestics in the girl&#39;s face.//

//The two children cease commotion and stand in a slight daze.//

//The agents look back at the elderly woman, who has slumped to the floor. Polot runs to her and checks her pulse.//

**POLOT:** //Shit,// I thought she was dead for a second...

//Agent Polot looks back at Agent Stafford.//

**POLOT:** Why didn&#39;t you- why didn&#39;t you use your amnestics? You were just standing there!

**STAFFORD:** I just- I didn&#39;t really... um...

**POLOT:** You //need// to get used to spraying that stuff, no way around it.

**STAFFORD:** It&#39;s just that... we just-

**POLOT:** Every second counts.

//Agent Polot picks up the elderly woman and carries her to a sofa as Agent Stafford watches.//

//Polot sets the woman down on the sofa, then grabs the two children to sit them down next to the woman.//

**STAFFORD:** I&#39;m sorry.

//Agent Polot looks at Agent Stafford and sighs.//

**POLOT:** Remember your training next time, Stafford.

//The two agents walk towards the front door. Agent Stafford glances behind her at the children and elderly woman sitting docile on the sofa.//

//The agents exit the house, closing the door behind them.//
