**Item #:** SCP-002-IT-J

**Object Class:** Safe (though not really if you&#39;re a doctor)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-002-IT-J instances are to be contained in separate cells in hallway 6 of the &#34;very dangerous things&#34; section of  [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/siti-italiani-j#Sito-Mania Site Mania]. The hallway&#39;s entrance must be monitored by a guard who has never (and I mean **never**) possessed the title of &#34;doctor&#34;. Access to the hallway is forbidden to anyone who has obtained a doctorate, regardless of the type of it. In the event that a doctor enters the hallway, the guard is authorized to terminate them, trust me, it&#39;s better this way.

**Description:** SCP-002-IT-J is an object, more precisely [REDACTED][[footnote]]Data censored for narrative needs.[[/footnote]], extremely dangerous and (we hope) lethal[[footnote]]No, seriously, we really hope it ends in a quick death. Poor things.[[/footnote]] to anyone who obtained a doctorate. In case a doctor comes near one of the --5-- 4 (See Experiment 001) instances of SCP-002-IT-J alone or accompanied just by other doctors, they will disappear leaving no trace.  It is assumed that this process is extremely painful given the inhuman screams perceived when a doctor remains in its presence. Currently, in order to study SCP-002-IT-J the presence of a not-doctor is necessary in the involved room (Gimmick discovered following Incident 296[[footnote]]Later renamed as Experiment 003 since, unexpectedly, nobody died. [[/footnote]]) so as to prevent the activation of the effect on doctoral colleagues present. In short, if you&#39;re a doctor and you&#39;re alone, stay away!

**Experiment 001**
The aim of the project is to send a non-doctor to study SCP-002-IT-J, as it is believed that this kind of being is immune. I&#39;m not sure why we didn&#39;t think about it before, we had those thingies for 12 years[[footnote]] It&#39;s SRE-M&#39;s fault, they prevented us from sending a D-Class for reasons such as morality and ethics. It&#39;s been 27 years since the last time they allowed me to use one. They say they needed someone to offer themselves, ugh. -Generic, Containment Officer[[/footnote]][[footnote]]Yeah, Generic&#39;s my surname. [[/footnote]].
&gt; **Item:** SCP-002-IT-J
&gt; 
&gt; **Location and date:** Site Mania, 11/11/11
&gt; 
&gt; **Involved personnel:** Dr. Medicine (from the control center); Pino (who we thank for kindly offering his services for this experiment &lt;3).
&gt; 
&gt; **[BEGIN LOG]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Medicine:** Okay, mister Pino, go into SCP-002-IT-J&#39;s containment room.
&gt; 
&gt; **Pino:** Excuse me, aren&#39;t there 5 of them? Which one do I have to enter?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Medicine:** Don&#39;t be picky! Choose one. And be quick, this is the most dangerous thing the Foundation has ever contained and we already wasted 12 years!
&gt; 
&gt; **Pino:** Yeah, just don&#39;t get angry. (Quietly) Sometimes they seem to forget or don&#39;t care who is not a doctor in something, how rude.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Medicine:** Come on, Pino, don&#39;t dawdle!
&gt; 
&gt; **Pino:** I&#39;m entering, see you soon, I hope.
&gt; 
&gt; (2:34 minutes later.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Pino:** (Burps.) Here I am, all is done.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Medicine:** (Comically spits out the drink he was sipping) ARE YOU ALIVE!?
&gt; 
&gt; **Pino:** I&#39;m not a doctor... did you expect me to die?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Medicine:** ... noooo. (Awkwardly chuckling.) We imagined that nothing would happen, kinda. Tell us, what happened?
&gt; 
&gt; **Pino:** Well, I arrived and SCP-002-IT-J was there on the table. I knew it was extremely dangerous, so I ate it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Medicine:** I beg your pardon?
&gt; 
&gt; **Pino:** I fed on it, I had it for lunch. It was really tasty, which is strange if you consider how many years it was in there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Medicine:** Yes, I understand you ate it, but how could you think of something this stupid?
&gt; 
&gt; **Pino:** Well, once I understood what it was, it seemed the most logical solution.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Medicine:** Can you explain yourself? What&#39;s SCP-002-IT-J?
&gt; 
&gt; **Pino:** You know what they say, don&#39;t you? An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
