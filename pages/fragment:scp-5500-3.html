++ Incident Report: CK-Class Reality Restructuring Scenario Related to S.W.A.N.N. Engine Usage

In October of 2027, a S.W.A.N.N. Engine was used to observe the life of an SCP-5500-Omega instance. Observation showed the SCP-5500-Omega instance in the process of crafting a narrative; it is believed that exposure to this process is what triggered the ensuing events.

Upon observing the creation of a narrative, operator Dr. Lycus inadvertently asserted control over the SCP-5500-Omega entity&#39;s nervous system, causing them to stand up from their chair and trip over a section of floor. Dr. Lycus was ejected from the engine following this, taking two steps out of the operator&#39;s booth, before falling over, dead from apparent psychic backlash.

In at least twenty-seven adjacent universes, instances of [[[SCP-3732]]] spontaneously lost all pigmentation before crumbling into non-anomalous pile of carbon-based dust, despite the fact that SCP-3732 is made out of granite.

Furthermore, several anomalies that Dr. Lycus had been studying (including [[[SCP-4879]]]) experienced a similar transformation. It had previously been noted that one of the author-entities encountered had a resemblance to Dr. Lycus, and that they could not be located using the S.W.A.N.N. Engine in subsequent trials.

Subsequent observation of SCP-5500-Omega entities over the next several weeks resulted in[[span class=&#34;hover&#34;]][[span class=&#34;hover-text&#34;]] They were crying.

**Note by Dr. Johnathan West:**

//That was when we found out they were mortal. That they could die.//

//It made sense, of course-- they were human. Humans die. But it raised some fucking terrifying implications. Two deaths had wiped out anomalies across the multiverse. I actually vomited when I heard the news.//

//It&#39;s... one thing to realize that you&#39;re living within a universe governed by the laws of fiction. It&#39;s another to realize that, when whatever is controlling and shaping your world dies, that&#39;s it. You don&#39;t even get a body to bury. We didn&#39;t even know if a soul could survive this.//

//And what&#39;s more, it doesn&#39;t fucking make// sense-- //pataphysical models show that works and the beings within can persist after the death of the author. So why don&#39;t we?//

++ Incident Report: CK-Class Reality Restructuring Scenario Related to S.W.A.N.N. Engine Usage

In November of 2027, the S.W.A.N.N. Engine went through improper shutdown procedures. As such, it was active without any operator, causing the Funnel to draw up into the consciousness of an SCP-5500-Omega instance and draw it from their dimension into our own.

As a result, the entirety of Site-43 (where the S.W.A.N.N. Engine was undergoing maintenance following the previous incident) had a series of seizures. Though no fatalities resulted, all personnel reported a vision of sitting in a cinema as a film about cat-like entities played, while experiencing the sensation of a heart attack.

Following this, all items and persons related to Herman-Fuller&#39;s Circus of the Disquieting, including several extra-dimensional locations related to the Circus, crumbled into an indistinct carbon-based dust.

++ Incident SCP-5500-Alpha:

On December 25th, 2027, several related anomalies and members of Foundation staff spontaneously underwent a CK-Class Reality-Restructuring scenario. Among those affected were:

* O5-06
* O5-12
* Dr. Jack Bright (including several copies created by SCP-963)
* [[[SCP-321]]]
* [[[SCP-590]]]

This corresponds to Dr. Bright attempting to sabotage the S.W.A.N.N. Engine, using SCP-963 to take over the body of a member of D-Class Personnel who was doing routine maintenance on the construct. Bright attempted to use SCP-963 on the -[[span class=&#34;hover&#34;]][[span class=&#34;hover-text&#34;]]As part of a deal made with the remaining Sarkic Cults in July of 2020, we had plenty of biotech.

Engine[[/span]], resulting in the metaphysical funnel drawing down a consciousness into itself, before overloading and collapsing in on itself. It is unknown what Dr. Bright&#39;s motives were; suicidal tendencies had been noted in his psychological file, but due to the nature of SCP-963, [[span class=&#34;hover&#34;]][[span class=&#34;hover-text&#34;]]So... yeah. We kind of pulled in a Bright from another universe. They&#39;re... taking it well?[[/span]] they were unable to self-terminate.[[/span]]

Despite the destruction of the S.W.A.N.N. Engine, CK-Class Reality Restructuring Scenarios similar to this one continued, cascading into the current ZK-Class Reality Failure Scenario.
