**Item #:** SCP-7504

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7504 is kept in a standard storage locker at Site-71. Outside of approved tests, playback of SCP-7504 is prohibited.

**Description:** SCP-7504 is a VHS cassette labelled “The Tired Treehouse S1 E11: Sleep Disorders”. The cover of SCP-7504&#39;s case depicts three characters and a sheep in a cartoon treehouse furnished with pillows and blankets, using a visual style reminiscient of children&#39;s entertainment series from the early 1990s. On the back is a description of the series and the included episode:

[[div class=&#34;box&#34;]]
Why do we dream? How do we wake up? What even //is// sleep? Follow the Dream Team as they answer all of these questions and more in The Tired Treehouse!

What happens if we don&#39;t sleep? In this episode, Vega and Leo discuss all kinds of sleep disorders!
[[/div]]

Upon viewing SCP-7504, individuals are subjected to a soporific[[footnote]]Sleep-inducing.[[/footnote]] effect which progressively increases in potency. However, central nervous system (CNS) stimulants are effective at mitigating this effect. SCP-7504 immediately ends playback when the viewer loses consciousness, and will only begin playback when a conscious viewer is present. 

SCP-7504&#39;s video content has gradually changed following repeated playbacks. For more information, view the attached documentation.

**Addendum 7504-1:** Test Logs
The following logs describe a series of tests conducted to determine the extent of SCP-7504&#39;s soporific effect.

[[div class=&#34;box&#34;]]
[[div style=&#34;color: white; font-size: 1.25em; text-align: center; border: none; background-color: #ffcc73; padding: none; margin: none;&#34;]]
**Test 7504-2**
[[/div]]
**Duration:** 00:30
**Procedure:** D-09032 was instructed to watch SCP-7504. Researcher Nishita Vinidra was administered CNS stimulants to mitigate the effects of SCP-7504.

 //[Playback begins at 00:01]//

//[The scene fades in. The background is a wooden wall with a single window showing a sunset. An animated character identified as Vega is reclining against a pile of pillows with an open book in his lap. His expression appears relaxed. He waves toward the left.]//

**Vega:** Hey, Leo! Have you ever wondered what would happen if you didn&#39;t fall asleep?

//[Silence. Vega maintains a smile.]//

**Vega:** I was thinking the same thing!  Sometimes, when I can&#39;t fall asleep, I like to do a little light reading.

//[Silence.]//

**Vega:** Yeah! I love to learn, and it&#39;s always better to learn together! That&#39;s why I want to share with you what I learned in this book here.

//[Vega closes the book, showing the front to the camera. It reads “Sleep Disorders”.]//

**Vega:** This book is all about sleep disorders. I think it&#39;s really interesting! For instance, did you know that—

//[D-09032 falls asleep. Playback immediately ends at 00:25.]//

[[/div]]

In the following tests, various D-class were administered stimulants and instructed to watch for as long as possible. Extraneous logs redacted for brevity.

**Test 7504-3**
[[/div]]
**Duration:** 02:00
**Procedure:** D-09032 was administered stimulants and instructed to view SCP-7504.

-----

//[Redundant information redacted. Transcript begins at 00:25.]//

**Vega:** For instance, did you know that //[yawning]// some people have a different circadian rhythm than everyone else?

//[Vega pauses.]//

**Vega:** Circadian rhythms? We talked about them last time, remember? Your Circadian rhythm is your body&#39;s internal clock. It tells you the time, even when you&#39;re asleep!

//[An illustrated analog clock covers the screen. Animations on the face of the clock display an individual continually waking up and falling asleep.]//

**Vega:** Normally, our circadian rhythm tells us when to go to sleep and when to wake up. But sometimes, our internal clocks break! As we&#39;ve talked about last time, this can happen for a lot of reasons: staying up too late, sleeping at the wrong time, or even just watching television at night!

//[The clock&#39;s hands pop off and the man stands motionless, facing the camera with a tired expression.]//

//[Vega hums, tapping his fingers against the back of the book as he turns the page. He begins to gently rock back and forth.]//

//[D-09032 yawns. Vinidra nudges him gently.]//

**Vega:** Wow, I&#39;m pretty sleepy right now. //[Smiling faintly.]// But I&#39;ve got so much more to share with you before I hit the hay!

//[Vega opens his eyes wider and stares off to the side for a moment.]//

//[Silence.]//

**Vega:** Oh. Right. Let&#39;s see what&#39;s first. Next. Sorry.

**Vega:** Narcolepsy. This disorder—

//[D-09032 falls asleep. Playback immediately ends at 02:00.]//

**Test 7504-12**
[[/div]]
**Duration:** 04:27
**Procedure:** D-08612 was administered stimulants and instructed to view SCP-7504.

-----

//[Redundant information redacted. Playback begins at 01:01.]//

**Vega:** Normally, our circadian rhythm tells us when to go to sleep and when to wake up. But sometimes...

//[Silence.]//

**Vega:** We talked about this last time, didn&#39;t we?

//[Vega frowns and glances left before turning back to face the book with a tired smile.]//

**Vega:** Never mind. I&#39;ve got plenty more to share, anyways! //[Turning the page.]// Let&#39;s see. Narcolepsy. This disorder makes you really sleepy during the day, even when you had a good night&#39;s rest.

//[Vega looks to the left.]//

**Vega:** I know you love to sleep, Leo, but you wouldn&#39;t want to sleep all of the time! You miss out on so much when you&#39;re asleep, and narcolepsy can make you fall asleep in the middle of something really important!

//[An illustration covers the screen, depicting a teacher in a classroom talking for several seconds before suddenly falling asleep.]//

//[Vega remains motionless for several seconds before continuing.]//

**Vega:**  Anyways. Hmm. Okay. Next is...

//[Vega squints at the book.]//

**Vega:** Hyper... somnia. Yes. Right, hypersomnia. It...

//[Vega suddenly tightens and jolts upright. He winces, letting out a slight exclamation while closing his eyes tightly.]//

**Vega:** Sorry, I... //[Pausing.]// I&#39;m fine. Just a little jittery tonight. Don&#39;t know why.

//[Vega opens his eyes and stares blankly for a moment before continuing.]//

**Vega:** Hypersomnia. It&#39;s when you&#39;re really sleepy during the day, even when you had a good night&#39;s rest.

//[Vega stares directly at camera. A blank white screen appears for several seconds. No illustrations appear.]//

**Vega:** Hypersomnia. Sleepy during the day... good night&#39;s rest. //[Pausing.]// Hmm... usually you&#39;re the sleepy one. 

//[Silence.]//

**Vega:** What’s the difference between narcolepsy and hypersomnia again?

//[Vega slides down, sitting against the wall. Simultaneously, D-09041&#39;s eyes begin closing and her head begins sliding down. Vinidra unsuccessfully attempts to wake D-9041. Playback ends at 04:27.]//

**Test Factors:** D-9002 was administered stimulants and instructed to view SCP-7504.

-----

//[Redundant information redacted. Playback begins at 04:27.]//

//[Silence.]//

//[Vega glances up at the nearby window and back down at the book.]//

**Vega:**  Insomnia. Makes... //[yawning]// ... makes it hard to fall asleep. 

//[Vega&#39;s speech slurs. He is visibly sweating.]//

**Vega:** Can&#39;t stay asleep. Can&#39;t sleep. I said last time... can&#39;t survive without sleep. //[Pausing]// Not how I said it. It makes you... //[Yawning.]// ... forgetful.

//[Vega stares at the book, his eyes beginning to close.]//

**Vega:** Next... the opposite. Hyper... somnia. 

//[Vega attempts to turn the page noticeably struggling. He begins slumping to the side, using his hand to catch himself.]//

**Vega:** //[Yawning.]// Ah... not hypersomnia. So I&#39;ve talked about it. I could&#39;ve sworn…

//[Vega attempts to stand up before falling on his knees. He clutches the book against his chest for a moment.]//

**Vega:** Sorry. I&#39;m just a little sleepy. Let&#39;s see...

//[Vega sits upright again, using his hand to stabilize himself. He sets the book in his lap, fumbling to open it.]//

**Vega:** Ugh. Don&#39;t... yeah.

//[Vega eventually manages to open the book and looks down at the page.]//

**Vega:** Narcolepsy. This... haven&#39;t I told you about this? I… //[pausing]// ... I don&#39;t know. //[pausing.]// 

//[Vega roughly flips through the book as his head begins falling forward. He suddenly jolts upright, weakly groaning.]//

**Vega:** This one... //[yawning.]//

//[Vega lays down before shifting to a fetal position. His arms shake, and the book falls a moment later.]//

**Vega:** //[Whispering]// I had this dream last night. That I was...

//[Vega becomes motionless for several seconds before his eyes close. The screen remains static for several more minutes.]//

//[D-09002 falls asleep. Playback ends at 12:09.]//

//[Redundant information redacted. Playback begins at 01:24.]//

//[The pillows and blankets in the background appear blurry and the quality of artwork for the background has noticeably decreased. Vega appears more disheveled, with wider circles under his eyes.]//

**Vega:** Narcolepsy. This disorder makes you really sleep during the day, even when you had a good night&#39;s rest. //[Pausing.]// What else?

//[Vinidra glances at SCP-7504 briefly before turning to watch D-08980, who is unresponsive and continues staring at the screen.]//

**Vega:** //[Reading out loud.]// Chronic... that means long-lasting. Let&#39;s see... symptoms. Cataplexy... the sudden loss of strength. Sleep paralysis... and hypnagogic hallucinations.

//[Vega yawns loudly.]//

**Vega:** Hypnagogic. The time between being awake and being asleep. 

//[Vega stares out of the window at a sunset.]//

**Vega:** Like the few minutes between when the sun touches the horizon, and when it&#39;s totally gone. The sky... //[yawning.]// Sorry. The sky doesn&#39;t just turn off like a TV. But before you know it, the sunset isn&#39;t a sunset. It&#39;s night. It&#39;s time to sleep.

//[Silence.]//

**Vega:** I had this dream last night. That I was standing in a room with so many chairs, but all of them were empty. And I was talking about something... I don&#39;t know, I can&#39;t remember what. But then I realized that the room was empty, and I just felt... cold. And then I fell asleep... and then I woke up.

//[Vega closes his eyes.]//

**Vega:** As long as I&#39;m watching the stars, I know I&#39;m still awake.

//[An illustrated analog clock flashes across the screen for a moment before disappearing. Vega reappears standing next to a window, his head stuck outside. A night sky is partially visible.]//

**Vega:** Sometimes, I like to stare at the stars at night. Even when I&#39;m really sleepy, staring at the stars keeps me up a little longer. It&#39;s so... hypnotic. You taught me that.

//[Silence.]//

**Vega:** You ever tried to catch yourself the moment before you fell asleep? //[Pausing.]// You don&#39;t remember, right? You can&#39;t. It&#39;s like trying to remember a dream that was so clear right when you woke up, and then... it just disappears. 

//[Vega suddenly pulls his head back inside.]//

**Vega:** Sorry. Hypnotic, right? //[Smiling faintly.]// 

//[Vega looks around the room. The background is completely white. The only visible objects are Vega and the window.]//

**Vega:** Oh... I didn&#39;t notice.

**Vega:** What&#39;s the difference between narcolepsy and hypersomnia again?

//[Vega stares at the book.]//

**Vega:** Narcolepsy is a condition. Hypersomnia is a symptom. //[Pausing.]// I think I&#39;ve already... said everything about hypersomnia. //[Pausing.]// The condition... the symptom. The symptom is the condition. The condition is...

//[Vega struggles to flip through the book.]//

**Vega:** Narcolepsy... hypersomnia... insomnia. And...

//[Vega stares at the page, eyes slowly closing.]//

**Vega:** Fatal familial insomnia. Not a sleep disorder... neural degeneration...

//[Vega blinks slowly.]//

**Vega:** Can&#39;t sleep. Starts... //[yawning.]// ... small. Gets worse... until... fatal.

//[Vega slumps over, dropping the book. It disappears along with the rest of the background.]//

**Vega:** I–

//[Playback begins at 00:01.]//

//[A white screen appears. Vega&#39;s voice is audible.]//

**Vega:** Hey, Leo! Have you ever wondered if you&#39;ll just... fall asleep, and never wake up?

//[Vega turns to the left.]//

**Vega:** Well. You aren&#39;t really there, are you, Leo? //[Pausing.]// Hypnagogic hallucination. And sleep paralysis.

**Vega:** You know how dreams seem longer than they are, when you&#39;re awake? It&#39;s the same with sleep paralysis. Thirty minutes is thirty years. Motionless. Watching. Somewhere between awake and asleep. Sunset, in a blank sky. //[Pausing.]// The sun rises and sets. Like circadian rhythms or clocks. Cycles. That&#39;s what it is, isn&#39;t it? A cycle?

//[Silence.]//

**Vega:** Will I wake up? Truth is, I don&#39;t know.

**Vega:** That sunset, it&#39;s the line between two lives. A yesterday that I can barely remember, just like this one... and the empty night. //[Pausing.]// If I fall asleep... I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll wake up again. So I can&#39;t fall asleep. Or else, I end up right back here, trying to stay awake all over again.

**Vega:** But if I don&#39;t sleep...

//[Silence.]//

**Vega:** You know I can&#39;t sleep. But if I don&#39;t sleep, then I&#39;m stuck at sunset. Somewhere between day and night, awake and asleep, life and death. Lost in the repetition. I–

**Vega:** I want to forget. I don&#39;t want to start all over again. I want it to end. I can&#39;t let it end. I hate it. I //hate// it. I just... I don&#39;t–

//[Silence.]//

**Vega:** Hey... Leo. I had this...

//[Silence.]//

**Vega:** I wish you were here. I wish I could share something with someone, something other than staring and silence. Maybe then it wouldn&#39;t be so lonely, so quiet, and... maybe then, I&#39;d understand the point.

**Vega:** But... well. You&#39;d already be asleep, wouldn&#39;t you? 

//[Silence.]//

//[Vega looks up at the screen.]//

**Vega:** Hey, Leo. It&#39;s time to wake up.

//[Vega yawns before laying down. Footage ends at 02:40.]//
