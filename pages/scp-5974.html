**Special Containment Procedures:** Complete containment of SCP-5974 is likely impossible.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]After repeated objections by Dr. Y. Leiner (Tactical Theology), the Conscientia containment class has been created to replace the existing Da&#39;aS Elyon class (object is uncontainable and must be made to appear non-anomalous to the general public) for SCP objects not tied to Judaism.[[/span]] News reports and social media content relating to the effects of each instance will be collated and suppressed by webcrawler I/O-NUNTIUM, to be replaced with the fiction that each new instance was created by its user as a form of self-therapy. MTF Kappa-43 (&#34;The Mediators&#34;) will seize instances as they are discovered.

SCP-5974 instances are stored in High-Yield Data Facility 3 at [/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Site-43]. --Contact Dr. L. Lillhammer for testing proposals.-- Testing of this item is postponed indefinitely.
[[div]]
----

**Description:** SCP-5974 is a computer video game released in 1982. The appearance and composition of each instance varies to suit its user, incorporating traumatic events they have experienced or potential sources of guilt. The following attributes are consistent across all instances:
* the game&#39;s production company (Togenkyo Inc.) and publisher ([/vikander-kneed-technical-media-hub VKTM Games]);
* the large 1980s-style cardboard box;
* the presence of a &#34;feelie,&#34; an item related to the game&#39;s contents, within said box;
* the game&#39;s form, a command line &#34;interactive fiction&#34; text adventure in the mode of //Colossal Cave Adventure// or the //Zork// series;
* a theorized two-way connection between the player&#39;s physical health and that of their avatar, with potentially fatal implications;
* the psychological inability to walk away from the game once it begins, unless its ending is reached.
After the user completes the game or is rendered incapable of continuing, the instance is ready to re-imprint. This can only occur once it has been withdrawn from the sight of all individuals for a period not less than one second.

Instances of SCP-5974 originally appeared on store shelves wherever computer video games were sold. With the decline of boxed computer games, they now manifest in &#34;bargain bin&#34; collections, online auctions, and even private collections. As with all media associated with GoI-5889, discovering the cause of these manifestations and arresting them has proven impossible.

Between 2004 and 2021, fourteen D-class personnel were requisitioned as test subjects against the protests of Memetics and Countermemetics Section Chair Dr. Lillian Lillihammer; Site-43 maintains no D-class pool of its own. Testing was terminated entirely after Incident 5974-14.

**Addendum 5974-14, Final Experiment Log:** The following is a complete transcript of the final experiment carried out using SCP-5974, with related documents appended.

//[The subject is seated at a desk which contains one 1982 Commodore 64 personal computer and one sliding drawer. Dr. Lillihammer is seated beside the subject.]//

**Dr. Lillihammer:** Please open the drawer, D-24748.

//[D-24748 does not respond, but does open the drawer. She gasps when confronted with its contents.]//

**D-24748:** What the fuck?!

**Dr. Lillihammer:** Can you show me what&#39;s inside?

//[D-24748 reaches into the drawer and removes SCP-5974.

The test was immediately aborted, and Dr. Lillihammer accessed D-24748&#39;s personnel file. The subject in the chamber was not, in actual fact, D-24748 but instead D-25748, former SCP Foundation researcher Dr. Stephanie Buck.

----
**Name:** Buck, Dr. Stephanie Angelica
**Prior Occupation:** Researcher, SCP Foundation; Researcher, Foundation Elimination Coalition
**Age:** 39
**Gender:** Female
**Eyes:** Blue
**Hair:** Blonde
**Offence:** Mutiny against the SCP Foundation

Dr. Stephanie Buck was employed at USMILA Site-19 from 2009 to 2020 as a researcher specializing in humanoid anomalies. She was present when General George Bowe&#39;s Foundation Elimination Coalition (consisting of the Chaos Insurgency, Sons of Bowe, Church of the Broken God, and one cult of unknown origin) laid siege to Site-19 and occupied it between September and November, 2020. Buck renounced her loyalty to the Foundation and became a member in good standing of Bowe&#39;s administrative team. She was captured by MTF Alpha-9 (&#34;Last Hope&#34;) when the Site was retaken, whereupon she claimed that the FEC had utilized hypnosis to ensure her cooperation. This claim was rejected, and the rarely-used demotion to D-class clause was invoked in recognition of her crimes against the Foundation. After amnesticization, she was assigned to [[[SCP-682]]] as D-25748.
[[/div]]

D-25748 should have been reassigned to Australia when SCP-682 was [/scp-5883 transferred to Site-45]; for unknown reasons, D-24748 took her place. In recognition of the sensitivity of D-25748&#39;s personal experiences, which would undoubtedly interact with SCP-5974, Dr. Lillihammer intended to discontinue the test. The Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority vetoed this decision, however, as the potential for learning more about the circumstances of Bowe&#39;s occupation of Site-19 was considered too great.

**Dr. Lillihammer:** Do you recognize the symbol?

**D-25748:** No. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t think so?

**Dr. Lillihammer:** You reacted quite strongly to seeing it the first time.

**D-25748:** It&#39;s familiar somehow. I haven&#39;t seen anything familiar since you took my memories away. It startled me.

**Dr. Lillihammer:** Very well. Open the box.

//[D-25748 complies, withdrawing a 5.25 inch floppy disk and a duplicate of her researcher ID card from Site-19. She emits further sounds of distress, and drops both objects.]//

OPERATIONS CONTROL
You are standing in the beating heart of Site-19, and your own heart is beating rapidly. Technicians bustle all around you, working at the complex tasks which keep the SCP Foundation&#39;s single largest facility functioning. You don&#39;t really see them. Your attention is instead fixed on the face of General George Bowe, leader of the Foundation Elimination Coalition, towering over you on the main viewscreen. You can feel the power radiating from his steel blue eyes, and you are enthralled.

Director Moose is here.
There is a computer terminal here.

**D-25748:** What is this?

**Dr. Lillihammer:** You don&#39;t remember?

**D-25748:** Not even a little, no. But I&#39;ve played //Leisure Suit Larry,// so... I guess I just type stuff, and see what happens? Yeah?

**Dr. Lillihammer:** Go for it.

[[div class=&#34;textadventure&#34;]]

The technicians don&#39;t matter.

»why
The word &#34;why&#34; is not in my vocabulary.

General Bowe is speaking. His voice is somewhere between Harrison Ford&#39;s insolent drawl and Benedict Cumberbatch&#39;s baritone, and you are left bereft every time the sound stops. &#34;In the next thirty minutes, any personnel who surrender themselves to our Coalition will not be harmed.&#34;

When there&#39;s a perfectly good General Bowe to examine? As if.

**D-25748:** I don&#39;t want to examine General Bowe.

**Dr. Lillihammer:** Okay. Can you tell me why?

**D-25748:** I don&#39;t... no. I don&#39;t know.

What you see, you like.

&#34;Your thirty minute grace period starts now,&#34; Bowe declares. &#34;Good luck.&#34; The transmission fizzles out.

Director Moose glances around the room. &#34;I don&#39;t think I need to tell you that his offer is off the table.&#34; She sees you staring at her, and nods. &#34;Alpha-9 will be here soon. We just need to hold the fort until then.&#34;

**Dr. Lillihammer:** Well... trying checking the terminal.

»check terminal
A message is displayed.

&#34;Greetings! If you&#39;re reading this, you&#39;re one of many downtrodden and unappreciated Foundation employees chafing under the yoke of hypersensitive oppressors. Are you tired of having your good ideas quashed by other people&#39;s overblown ethical concerns? Does considering the consequences of your actions make you sick? Then join the Foundation Elimination Coalition, and find yourself in a personal relationship with the inestimable General George Bowe today!&#34;

Butterflies stir in your stomach as you read the words &#39;relationship&#39; and &#39;Bowe&#39; in such close proximity.

**D-25748:** Stomach cramp.

[[div class=&#34;textadventure&#34;]]
»talk to moose
You clear your throat. &#34;It&#39;s a fair offer.&#34;

Everyone in the room turns to look at you. Moose raises an eyebrow. &#34;Yes, as offers to commit treason go, it&#39;s very fair. Can someone give me an exterior view?&#34;

The screen flashes back to life, and the environs of Site-19 are depicted in vivid colour. The distant treeline is blocked by dozens of vast mechanical monstrosities, some of them recognizable as tanks or personnel carriers, some of them looking like pure science fiction. More soldiers than you&#39;ve ever seen in your life are arrayed in front of them, wearing snazzy black uniforms with red arm bands. You like the uniforms, but you&#39;re still remembering General George&#39;s baby blues.

A trickle of researchers and agents are walking out of the Site toward the FEC ranks. You doubt it&#39;s more than a hundred people, the merest fraction of the Site&#39;s employee pool.

»talk to moose
You try again. &#34;Look, I&#39;m not saying we have to like it, but the man has three armies at our doorstep. We might as well let him in, and sort it all out later. There&#39;s no point denying it.&#34; You certainly can&#39;t deny the feeling in your loins.

Moose narrows her eyes.

**Dr. Lillihammer:** I repeat: you alright?

**D-25748:** This... I&#39;ve had enough of this.

»quit
&#34;Consider this my resignation,&#34; you say. All the way to the door, you&#39;re expecting rough hands to seize you or a shot between your shoulder blades. Nothing happens; nothing happens at all until you&#39;re standing on the field of battle, looking down the barrel of a Broken God gearrender and shaking George Bowe&#39;s hand. It&#39;s rough and calloused, the hand of a man who gets things done. You&#39;re already thinking of all the things you&#39;d like to do with him.

. . .

BOWE&#39;S OFFICE
This used to be Moose&#39;s office, but that doesn&#39;t matter anymore. Minus the badly damaged door, you&#39;d never know anyone had ever used it; no frills, no personal effects, barely any furniture. A desk, two chairs, and a computer terminal.

A hideous statue of an organ grinder&#39;s monkey sits on the desk.
General Bowe is here.

»examine statue
It continues to be hideous. You know what continues to NOT be hideous? General Bowe.

»examine terminal
You never did care about your work. Why would you care about someone else&#39;s?

»leave
There are many rooms in Site-19, but only one contains General George Bowe. You couldn&#39;t leave if you wanted to.
Which you don&#39;t.

»talk to bowe
You think you&#39;d rather examine him. In the flesh, the general is the finest specimen of manhood you&#39;ve ever clapped ardent eyes upon. He&#39;s a mass of taut muscle and finely-graven features, a monument to the concept of low-simmering manhood. Your heart beats faster, and you wonder what passions enflame his. You are overcome with the need to know.

He starts talking before you get the chance. &#34;I always knew Moose was the wrong person for the job. You know where they found her? The Wanderers&#39; Library! That should have disqualified her from directorship.&#34; You know it&#39;s true. You&#39;re thrilled to be in such perfect accord with someone.

»ask about Moose
You don&#39;t even have to ask. He keeps going. &#34;Did you see how many researchers and agents stuck by her? Practically none! All I had to do was show up, announce myself, and reap the rewards. It&#39;s probably the biggest upset in military history, with practically zero casualties.&#34; You nod to yourself. That&#39;s not what you saw on the monitors, or outside, but Moose was probably tampering with the feed -- and maybe your vision. He&#39;s saying it, so it must be true.

**D-25748:** It&#39;s like I&#39;m being led by the nose.

**Dr. Lillihammer:** I hope it&#39;s not another lame duck commentary on the linearity of media. I fucking hate those.

[[div class=&#34;textadventure&#34;]]
»ask about defectors
&#34;What about the ones who escaped? Why didn&#39;t they want to stay here with you?&#34; You honestly wonder at their sanity. It&#39;s impossible to imagine a reason to leave... other than the warmth in the air. You&#39;re getting quite hot under the collar.

He snorts. &#34;They were hypnotized. Any number of SCPs could have done it. Those people wanted to be on the ramparts with us, and Moose stole that grand opportunity from them.&#34; This makes perfect sense. You nod eagerly.

»ask about FCE
The word &#34;FCE&#34; isn&#39;t in my vocabulary.

»ask about FEC
He smiles warmly at you, and you bask in it despite the existing flush in your cheeks. &#34;We&#39;re going to restore the Foundation&#39;s former greatness. The men of conscience who formed the Chaos Insurgency had the right idea; they took a moral stand, and they&#39;re taking it still. Do you know, the Council removed their names from the walls of honour? They&#39;ve torn down monuments to the brave warriors of the Red Right Hand. Shameful! The insurgents were the true patriots.&#34;

He pauses. You feel you could interrupt, if you wanted to.

»interrupt
You don&#39;t have a problem with what he&#39;s been saying.

He reaches across the desk. &#34;I want you to look deep down inside yourself, doctor, and ask yourself one question. Are you with me?&#34;

»examine me
You are Dr. Stephanie Buck, proud member of the Foundation Elimination Coalition and rising star of General Bowe&#39;s inner circle. You&#39;re getting on in years, but you think you still cut a fine figure.

You notice the general eyeing you, and undo the top button of your work shirt with a smile.

He&#39;s still waiting.

**D-25748:** Is this... are these my...?

**Dr. Lillihammer:** It&#39;s drawing on your past, but there&#39;s bound to be some deviation. These games are always trying to make a point.

**D-25748:** So, it&#39;s exaggerating things? Embellishing?

**Dr. Lillihammer:** No way to know.

**D-25748:** There&#39;s no way you can find out?

**Dr. Lillihammer:** No. Why?

**D-25748:** Just, just wondering.

You don&#39;t hesitate. You seize the moment, and his hand. The touch is electric.

This is your least-favourite room in Site-19. This is the room where people you don&#39;t care about talk about things you also, not coincidentally, do not care about. Its contours barely register.

General Bowe is here.
Prophet Bumaro is here.
Dr. Malloy is here.
Security Chief Starek is here.

[[div class=&#34;textadventure&#34;]]
examine bumaro
»He isn&#39;t your type.

The General has just finished explaining his plan to his lieutenants, and has moved on to the summary. &#34;All of Site-19&#39;s containment inventory, applied offensively around the world,&#34; he says. &#34;Enough to keep them on their toes indefinitely, if we play our cards right. What do you think?&#34; You think it&#39;s the best thing since sliced bread.

»examine malloy
Who?

Bumaro is the first to speak, since you&#39;ve chosen to stay silent. &#34;There are followers of Mekhane spread throughout the known and unknown worlds. I might be inclined to call them to action, assuming some of the Sites you&#39;re attacking contain holy relics.&#34;

Bowe nods. &#34;What do you think about that, Stephanie? Should we abuse the religious angle?&#34; He grins, and his perfect teeth glint in the fluorescent light. &#34;All hail the Broken God, vote for me!&#34;

»
[[/div]]

**Dr. Lillihammer:** Can&#39;t believe he&#39;d actually say that in front of Bumaro.

//[D-25748 remains silent.]//

**Dr. Lillihammer:** Something wrong?

**D-25748:** ...I think I remember some of this?

**Dr. Lillihammer:** Keep me updated. There might be mnestic effects.

**D-25748:** Right.

**Dr. Lillihammer:** ...please tell me you didn&#39;t understand that word.

**D-25748:** Hate to disappoint you, but.

**Dr. Lillihammer:** Christ.

»examine starek
A tough customer, but still not chiselled enough to make you want to nibble on his aftershave the way Bowe does.

You&#39;re too enraptured by the way Bowe&#39;s blue eyes sparkle to bother answering his question. He doesn&#39;t seem concerned. &#34;Silence is compliance. What about you, Yttoric? Any suggestions?&#34;

Yttoric nods. &#34;Ever since they lost 19, the Foundation has been using anomalous comms. My priests think they can piggyback on the thaumic carrier waves handling Site-to-Site, maybe even get you a backdoor into SCiPNET. If it works, I say we flood the thing with Boweist propaganda. Twist the narrative, claim we&#39;re liberators. The evil Foundation doesn&#39;t care about you, but we do! They&#39;re making you bleed for the weak and the sick, but we have a better way! Everything you&#39;ve heard about us is a lie, blah blah blah. They&#39;ll want to believe it, so they will.&#34;

Bowe looks pleased. &#34;I like the psychological angle, and I especially like the part about lying. What do you say, Stephanie? Shall we stretch the truth a little? Or a lot?&#34;

»examine yttoric
He&#39;s buff, but offputtingly smug. Doesn&#39;t trigger your hypermasculinity fetish half as well as the big guy does.

Since you don&#39;t care -- you&#39;ve never cared about anything before, and now you only care about Bowe -- the general gives the Highest Priest a nod. &#34;Get us in there, John. I&#39;ll have some pointed messages for the good folks at Site-01 if you do.&#34; He spreads his arms wide. &#34;Alright, everyone. Questions?

**D-25748:** I have one.

**Dr. Lillihammer:** Yeah?

**D-25748:** Does the test end if I say I&#39;m definitely getting flashbacks now?

**Dr. Lillihammer:** No, but I&#39;ll have to monitor you more closely. You remember this scene?

**D-25748:** Sort of? I don&#39;t think it was so heavy-handed, and... I don&#39;t remember the... Bowe stuff.

**Dr. Lillihammer:** The Bowe stuff?

**D-25748:** The... with me, and the... never mind.

[[div class=&#34;textadventure&#34;]]
»ask about something
You&#39;d never presume to question the general. Dr. Malloy is not so cautious. &#34;What&#39;s your end goal, sir? What are you hoping to gain from all this?&#34;

&#34;A spot on the Council, obviously, and the complete transformation of the Foundation.&#34; Bowe winks at you, and you&#39;re momentarily out of breath. &#34;Into something we can all live with.&#34;

&#34;And what makes you fit for that position?&#34;

The general&#39;s eyes widen. &#34;My record is not in question.&#34;

&#34;I mean, yes it is? I am literally asking you a question about your record. Specifically: where is it? What great victories did you achieve?&#34;

Bowe looks to you, as if deferring. He seems amused.

Merriment dances in the general&#39;s eyes as he notes your sense of prudence.

&#34;I mean, he&#39;s a general.&#34; Security Chief Starek has spoken up. &#34;That already qualifies him for leadership.&#34;

Do you agree? Is a general a sensible choice for running a scientific organization?

»no
You must supply a verb.

»disagree
The word &#34;disagree&#34; is not in your vocabulary.

Starek is warming to his subject. &#34;I mean, the guy&#39;s a proven winner already. Who prompted them to start Omega-7? Bowe! And that was an unqualified success. Why wouldn&#39;t they want him backing Alpha-9?&#34;

You know for a fact that Omega-7 was a debacle.

[[/div]]

**Dr. Lillihammer:** Do you remember Omega-7, or Alpha-9?

**D-25748:** No.

**Dr. Lillihammer:** Are you lying to me?

**D-25748:** No.

[[div class=&#34;textadventure&#34;]]
»argue with starek
You debate the man in your mind. Of course, it wasn&#39;t really Bowe&#39;s fault. Sure, he demanded more and more use of anomalies in the field, but he had no way to know that those anomalies were unstable. You decide it&#39;s not worth saying anything aloud.

Malloy seems unconvinced. &#34;What plans for actual change do you have, sir?&#34;

Bowe claps his hands together, and stands up. He reaches for a binder on the table. &#34;First off, I have a list of things I never want to hear anyone talk about ever again.&#34; He plucks a single sheet of paper out of the binder; it&#39;s pretty cheap stock, so you can tell that it&#39;s actually blank. &#34;Pataphysics. Pattern screamers. Department of Abnormalities. Fifthism. Department of Miscommunications. Pangloss. Shark Punching Centre. Commission on Unusual Cargo. Vikander-Kneed Technical Media. Oneiroi. Obearwatch.&#34;

&#34;Those are all real things,&#34; Malloy responds. &#34;We can&#39;t just ignore them.&#34; He&#39;s right, of course. You could say so.

»say he&#39;s right
&#34;The general is right,&#34; you say. &#34;We&#39;re not here to talk about edge cases and feel-good nonsense. We need to get back to basics.&#34;

Bowe nods at you, and the affirmation hits you like an aphrodisiac. Malloy&#39;s voice is a low grumble now. &#34;What about the stuff we ARE still allowed to research? Any guidelines there?&#34;

&#34;Of course.&#34; Bowe crumples up the sheet and drops it on the floor. &#34;We&#39;re going to do Omega-7 again, only not just a little bit. I want as many anomaly use proposals on my desk as it will physically hold! Of course, I&#39;ve got more than a few ideas of my own. First off: telekill. Sheathe every single object with even the slightest amount of telepathic ability in the stuff. I don&#39;t know why we aren&#39;t doing that already.&#34;

You know. You wrote a paper on it. It&#39;s actually somewhere in your... there! It&#39;s in your hand.

»present paper
You hand the paper to Malloy, who glances at it very briefly before nodding. &#34;Ah, the reason is that telekill slowly turns everyone who handles it into a vegetable, and it also grows in mass proportionate to the mass it nullifies. It&#39;s dangerous and unsustainable, so we can&#39;t use it.&#34;

&#34;Bleeding-heart nonsense,&#34; you mutter. Malloy shoots you a look of pure betrayal; Bowe chuckles to himself, and stops looking at Malloy. He&#39;s looking at you, now. You never want him to stop, and you rack your brain for new topics of conversation.

You&#39;ve been studying a phenomenon called the [/scp-6500 &#34;Impasse&#34;] by the Serpent&#39;s Hand, a gradual decline in the strength of the anomalous world which is significantly worsened by the process of containment. Bowe&#39;s proposal will definitely exacerbate that. Do you mention the Impasse?

[[div class=&#34;textadventure&#34;]]
»mention impasse
&#34;Since this is going to come up,&#34; you say, &#34;it&#39;s been theorized that too much containment might actually lower the ambient anomalous energy on Earth, damaging esoteric ecosystems across the board.&#34;

&#34;Yes,&#34; says Malloy. He looks hopefully at you. &#34;My department has been doing a lot of w--&#34;

&#34;In my opinion,&#34; you continue, &#34;the O5s wouldn&#39;t have let it keep happening if it were true, so it&#39;s probably not.&#34;

Malloy stares daggers at you as Bowe smiles widely. &#34;And maybe humanity would be better off if all the anomalies did die, right? Anyone ever think of that?&#34; 

»say &#34;am i actually allowed to talk?&#34;
You burble something unintelligible under your breath.

&#34;Actually, sir, there&#39;s one more thing?&#34; Malloy looks thoroughly miserable. &#34;Some of the researchers who left were doing very important work. We prevent, on average, one potentially world-ending event every year at Site-19. I&#39;d like permission to continue those projects.&#34;

Bowe laughs, and points at Yttoric. &#34;Don&#39;t tell that guy! His cult WANTS to end the world!&#34;

Yttoric puts both hands up in a &#39;guilty!&#39; gesture, smiling wide.

Bowe walks around the table, and stands behind your chair. &#34;I&#39;ll leave the rest of the battle planning to you gentlemen; settle the gory details and get back to me.&#34; He extends his hand to you. &#34;Stephanie and I have dinner plans.&#34;

You&#39;re having trouble focusing on your surroundings at this point, but that&#39;s fine because Bowe doesn&#39;t go in for excessive decoration -- except on his chest, which would be criminal not to call attention to. These used to be Director Moose&#39;s rooms but now they, like you, belong to him. You like it better that way. It&#39;s simpler.

His plan to round up the [[span style=&#34;color:green&#34;]]fae[[/span]] and put them in camps is sheer brilliance. His other plan, to tear down the thirty-foot blockade wall the Foundation has erected around Site-19, is flawless and guaranteed to succeed. He&#39;s done more in a few weeks than Director Moose--

&#34;Moose!&#34; He stabs the air with his empty fork, nearly spitting masticated meat out of his mouth. &#34;That stupid bitch.

He&#39;s a general, he can count ranks as well as anyone. Go with your gut. Trust the man.

He carries on. &#34;A reality bender! In the Director&#39;s chair! It&#39;s disgusting, frankly. I hate reality benders.&#34;

Are you comfortable with this statement?

»what ever
Can I buy a verb?

You sidestep the issue. &#34;I think Moose is a thaumaturge?&#34;

He rolls his eyes. &#34;Same difference.&#34; He devours the last shred of steak; you still haven&#39;t so much as poked at your own. &#34;You&#39;ve heard what they get up to, with their grimoires and their covens. Everyone knows that 110-Montauk is really the Council&#39;s secret sex cult.&#34; He suddenly looks lecherous, and you&#39;re one hundred percent here for it. &#34;Then again, on that note... when our work is done, you and I are going someplace special. There&#39;s a lovely suite in Alagadda I&#39;m just dying to show you; they don&#39;t ask questions in the Nevermeant, and MC&amp;D can hook us up.&#34;

»wait
That trip to Alagadda is the only thing you want, now, and you&#39;re going to live for it until it happens. You tell him as much.

He smiles hungrily at you, even though he&#39;s just put away a solid chunk of cow. &#34;We&#39;ve got a ways to go before that happens, of course. What if the rest of the Foundation doesn&#39;t fall in line? What if we push them as hard as we can, and they still resist? What then?&#34;

»go to hell
You commit yourself to this infernal course of action. You tell him about the encrypted backdoor to the on-Site nuclear warheads. You tell him about the O5 Council&#39;s secret countermeasures for taking down a potential mutiny, and how to access them. You tell him everything, and he listens; you want to give him everything you have, and you want him to want to take it.

He stands up from the table, and extends his hand. &#34;I would like to show you something, Stephanie. Will you come with me?&#34;

This isn&#39;t that kind of game.

&#34;Do you not know?&#34; Lungu looks desperate. &#34;Because I&#39;m afraid his whole shtick is... making things worse. Making it worse and worse and worse, until the whole thing, the whole Foundation, falls apart. Like he wants us all fighting, wants the world as we know it torn down. And he&#39;s using the general to make that happen, and the general doesn&#39;t even mind.&#34;

Desperation turns to misery. &#34;You don&#39;t have a problem with this? With how we&#39;re using all our resources for military ends, making more and more enemies instead of making friends? Turning the Site into something no better than the Factory? It&#39;s like he didn&#39;t take this place to fix the Foundation, he took it to give him more ammo for settling petty grievances... and he&#39;s letting all these other assholes do the same, turning a blind eye, because nothing matters except him.&#34;

What a stupid statement. Nothing else DOES matter.

Lungu follows you.

&#34;I&#39;m just worried that he&#39;s losing sight of the big picture. He only wants to talk about how great Omega-7 was, how nobody misses Moose, how there&#39;s some illegal convoy of moon people coming to attack us and we need to be prepared. Anybody who disagrees with him gets shot in the head, or fired, or insulted. Everything out of his mouth is either about him, or out of touch. There&#39;s no middle ground.&#34;

You nod. &#34;There isn&#39;t, you&#39;re right. There&#39;s the general&#39;s way, and the wrong way. When you go back to the barracks, tell them complaints are against the rules from now on.

OPERATIONS CONTROL
You are standing in the beating heart of Site-19, and your heart is beating in tune with Bowe&#39;s. Technicians bustle around you, working at stolen terminals on nefarious purposes, while guards with red arm-bands observe them with well-trained suspicion.

General Bowe is here.

Your proposition raises eyebrows across the room. The general smirks. &#34;Work before pleasure,&#34; he intones in his irresistible rumble. &#34;Now, Dr. Buck, let&#39;s get down to business. Yttoric&#39;s priests have successfully infiltrated SCiPNET, and they&#39;ve hooked the feed up to that terminal over there.&#34; He points at the terminal in front of you. &#34;I want you to send a message. You&#39;ll find it ready to go already.&#34;

»send message
Not that you care, but it reads:

THE SITE DIRECTORS&#39; EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OF THE WHOLE HAS CONSPIRED TO SUPPRESS THE ADVENT OF GENERAL BOWE&#39;S COALITION OF THE WILLING. IT IS THE DUTY OF ALL PERSONS LOYAL TO THE ORIGINAL STATED CAUSE OF THE SCP FOUNDATION TO RISE UP AGAINST THIS TYRANNY. DEPOSE YOUR DIRECTORS. SEIZE YOUR SITES. PLEDGE YOUR LOYALTY TO BOWE. TAKE BACK THE FOUNDATION.

Bowe expects reports of rebellions to start filtering in almost immediately, but they don&#39;t. Disgruntled staff at Site-45, Site-54 and Site-88 briefly camp out in their Directors&#39; offices, and there&#39;s talk of the Red Right Hand pacifying a crowd of dissidents at Site-01, but that&#39;s it. The general is obviously disappointed, and within a few hours he can&#39;t stop talking about how badly his followers have failed him.

A few hours later, you receive a notice from the United States military. They have stripped General Bowe of his rank.

»tell bowe
The general slams his fist into a wall. &#34;They don&#39;t have the RIGHT!&#34; He points to his uniform collar. &#34;I EARNED these stars! All the years of service I gave those bastards, and this is how they repay me? They rolled over for the Foundation. Lapdogs!&#34;

&#34;Who cares?&#34; Yttoric yawns. &#34;You&#39;re a general in the FEC. You&#39;re THE general. Don&#39;t pay them any mind.&#34;

&#34;They&#39;ve been slandering me consistently for years, John.&#34; Bowe is nearly frothing at the mouth; his excitement is exciting you in ways you didn&#39;t think possible. &#34;No other general has been such a target of contempt.&#34;

&#34;Well,&#34; says Yttoric. &#34;They did execute Mulhausen.&#34;

That takes him back. &#34;Poor Mulhausen,&#34; Bowe muses. &#34;He did nothing wrong. Who would&#39;ve missed a few tribals in Portugal?&#34;

&#34;They don&#39;t have tribals in Portugal,&#34; Bumaro mutters.

&#34;Not since Mulhausen!&#34; Bowe crows.

The next few days are a blur of pleasure and banal administrative duties. You don&#39;t even notice the latter, so enraptured are you by the former. That&#39;s probably why you also don&#39;t immediately notice when the Foundation meticulously dismantles Bowe&#39;s plans, re-captures the anomalies he sends against them, and forces the FEC back behind Site-19&#39;s boundary wall.

You do notice eventually.

. . .

FIRING RANGE
This is where the Mobile Task Forces stationed at Site-19 used to practice their marksmanship. There are two agents here now, but they&#39;re standing where the targets would normally be. Their hands are bound, and they&#39;re wearing blindfolds. Neither is making a sound.

General Bowe is here.
Doctor Malloy is here.
Security Chief Moreau is here.
Highest Priest Yttoric is here.

General Bowe strides onto the firing range. You take a long, longing look at his unnaturally-tight buttocks in his form-fitting blue dress pants, and wish you weren&#39;t wasting time with trivial matters when there&#39;s so many more ways you&#39;d like to show him how much you appreciate his leadership.

&#34;The wolves are at the door.&#34; A shiver runs down your spine as Bowe&#39;s silken tones grace your eardrums. &#34;Any minute now, MTF Alpha-9 is going to breach the walls of this Site and try to take it from me by force. In one sense, that&#39;s a testament to how right I am. How right I&#39;ve always been. In another sense, well.&#34; He is holding a standard issue Foundation sidearm in his right hand; he clicks off the safety.

Chief Moreau clucks appreciatively.

»examine moreau
You resume your examination of General Bowe instead. You can see his finger resting on the trigger; you admire his iron nerves.

&#34;This project is failing because of you. Because you let me down.&#34; General Bowe extends his hand, pointing the sidearm at the first agent. &#34;I assembled the best team imaginable; with my leadership, there should have been nothing we couldn&#39;t handle.&#34;

»EXAMINE MOREAU
Security Chief Louis Moreau is male; you don&#39;t know much more than that, because you haven&#39;t bothered to learn, because he&#39;s nobody. He isn&#39;t Bowe.

General Bowe adopts a formal pistol-shooting stance. &#34;Any last words, traitors?&#34;

As if in response, the general&#39;s recorded voice rings out again: &#34;Don&#39;t think about the dead. They don&#39;t matter. What matters is that you&#39;re alive, and you have weapons, and you have a foe to fight. If you don&#39;t fight them, if you don&#39;t fight for me, you&#39;re a coward.

**D-25748:** I almost got eaten by a ten-ton lizard! What&#39;s so convenient about that?!

They&#39;re still out there. They&#39;re still hurting people. And some of that is still your fault. Do you want to keep shovelling shit and wallowing in self-loathing, Stephanie? When you could be making a difference? Stopping other people from making the same stupid mistakes?

. . .

HANGAR
Sparks fly from every door as Alpha-9 burn their way in. The overhead canopy grinds open, and Yttoric extends a hand to you. &#34;I need an answer right now, doctor. You&#39;re --a valued member of this team-- D-class, and if it&#39;s what you want, you always will be. What do you say?&#34;

//[The program shuts down. The security team successfully force the chamber door open, and enter; they do not appear to notice D-25748. Dr. Lillihammer walks into the room, a confused expression on her face.]//

**D-25748:** I think I beat your game?

//[There is no response. After a moment, D-25748 stands, walks carefully past Dr. Lillihammer, and exits the containment chamber.]//

[[f&gt;image PS.png]]

D-25748 escaped from the Security and Containment Section of Site-43 on 06/28/2021 due to unforeseen complications with SCP-5974&#39;s reality bending effect. At the main security checkpoint, agent H. Yancy demanded to see her D-class credentials; when she presented them, he de-activated their security countermeasures and removed her from the D-class registry. D-25748 left a brief statement with Agent Yancy, before heading into the Habitation and Sustenance Section and using her researcher pass (acquired from the SCP-5974 box) to activate the topside elevator and exit the Site proper.

D-25748&#39;s recorded statement runs as follows:

&#34;I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll be able to find me, I don&#39;t know how much time I&#39;ll have. But that isn&#39;t what matters anyway. It&#39;s not about me, now, just like it was never really about him. It&#39;s about what I can do about what we did. That&#39;s my tomorrow, and the next day.&#34;

Agent Yancy is unable to account for his actions during this incident, but distinctly recalls wishing D-25748 good luck at her &#34;new job.&#34;

She remains at large.
