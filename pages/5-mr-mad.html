That goddamn bastard Stripes. I just heard the news - he&#39;s killed two of the others. At least it&#39;s not a discontinuation. But still.

Dr. Wondertainment did it, of course. Stripes never thought a fucking thing that Wondertainment didn&#39;t think first. Or someone at Wondertainment, fuck if I know. Is there an actual, singular Dr. Wondertainment? They don&#39;t fucking tell us nothing, though Stripes always did seem to know more than he should. Him and Redd. Goddamn son of a bitch Mr. Redd.

Things were going so well until we reached the End of the World. That&#39;s when the plan fell apart.

We had a plan. We had a plan. If the others had just motherfucking stuck to the plan, we&#39;d all be sitting pretty, but no, they just couldn&#39;t. Bastards! Goddamn bastards! Goddamn-

*

Sorry, where was I? Ugh. Fucking Wondertainment shtick. The last parting insult. When I get &#39;too&#39; angry, I pass out for a little while. Needless to say, this happens a lot. That pisses me off too. Sometimes it sets off a repeating cycle, get mad, pass out, get mad, pass out… Christ.

Mr. Mad, they call me, ha ha very funny. Stamped and sewn together like the others. Were some of us people, real people, before this? I don&#39;t know. Was I? I really fucking don&#39;t know. Maybe this is all some sick joke by Wondertainment. Putting us through these paces. Letting some of us get thrown at that… what do they call it, the Foundation. Bunch of fucking assholes there too. They killed Mr. Onion, did you know that? For no good fucking reason. Peeled apart his layers and set them on fire. If the Foundation ever finds me… Well, let&#39;s just say they&#39;ll find out why you really don&#39;t want to make me angry.

That was a joke. Get it? Mr. Laugh would be proud. Especially proud, if Mr. Redd hadn&#39;t… ugh. Pisses me off just thinking about it. That goddamn PIECE OF SHIT! MOTHERFUCKING—

*

Well, lost it there again, didn&#39;t I?

Mr. Mad, indeed. Maybe Light was right, maybe that&#39;s why Wondertainment did what he (she? they?) did. &#34;You&#39;re too obvious,&#34; Mr. Light had said. &#34;You&#39;re this guy who… gets angry. //Superhumanly// angry. You can&#39;t even affect other people.&#34;

Well, they underestimate Mr. Mad. You ever hear about ordinary people lifting cars when their adrenaline is high enough? Well, I can do that. I can do that whenever I want. Does it piss me off that I didn&#39;t get something more interesting as a Little Mister shtick? Of course it fucking pisses me off. How do you THINK I FEEL ABOUT—

*

Okay. Just need to stay calm. Just long enough to do what I need to do.

I&#39;m not going to wait around for them to get their act together. I&#39;m going to find Redd myself. I&#39;m going to find him and I&#39;m going to do for him what he did for the others.

The others are afraid. Chickenshit little bastards, I say. I&#39;m a little afraid of him too, I&#39;ll admit that much. But that never stopped me from goddamn anything and it sure as fuck is not going to start now. After what he did, not just the Ms. Sweetie thing, but the rest…

But I&#39;ll get him. Oh yes.

That goddamn sonuvabitch will never know what hit him.
