**Item #:** SCP-4113

**Object Class:** Hera (Hostile/High Utility)

**Special Containment Procedures:** If encountered SCP-4113 is to be considered hostile. Capture of the object is of paramount importance given the potential utility of its anomalous technology to the fleet. No less than 3 Varuna class vessels must be utilized in capture of the object.

**Description:** SCP-4113 is a longship of ancient Nordic design. SCP-4113 is capable of reaching 99.9999938% the speed of light. SCP-4113 is 174.3 feet (53 meters) long and 26 feet (8 meters) wide and contains approximately 220 rowing benches. SCP-4113 is capable of retaining a replenishing pocket of atmosphere around itself at all times.

SCP-4113 has a capacity for 340 crew members. SCP-4113 also has a number of devices installed along its structure of unknown purpose. SCP-4113&#39;s crew show no signs of age despite the length of their time in space and do not appear to suffer from the ill effects of longtime radiation exposure.

**Discovery:** 126 days after the exodus from Sol system, Merin Aspic of the Mobile Foundation Orbital Research Compound 07 [[footnote]]Officially designated FORC 07[[/footnote]] detected a high energy gamma flash approximately 16 light minutes away from the UEF [[footnote]]United Earth Fleet[[/footnote]]. Pallas Athena Nine was notified via radio and the FSF Delivery was dispatched to investigate the source of the wave.

As SCP-4113 was approached, it reduced its velocity and turned to meet the Delivery. However, SCP-4113 possessed primitive means of communication and no contact was made. After 2 hours and 36 minutes SCP-4113 turned back and resumed its previous course. Telemetry data indicated a course for Sol.

As SCP-4113 accelerated away, it emitted gamma radiation in increasing amounts. It is believed that this is a result of the object impacting interstellar hydrogen at appreciable fractions of c.

**Addendum 4113.1:**

&gt; What little identifying data was able to be gathered from SCP-4113 indicated that the figurehead of the object was carved in the guise of Gróa, an individual described in the Poetic Edda. Documents from Pallas Athena&#39;s library have shown a strong resemblance between the figurehead and artistic depictions from the The Lay of Svipdagr.
&gt; 
&gt; The Lay of Svipdagr is a pair of poems describing an individual who must travel to Jötunheimr [[footnote]]One of the nine worlds and the home of the Norse Giants[[/footnote]]. The timing of this myth&#39;s ties strongly into a loose collection of historical records identifying an individual known as Svifdag who was the youngest son of the petty king of Uppsala in 1011.
&gt; 
&gt; Several historical records indicate that Svifdag began work on the largest long ship ever constructed in 1012. No historical record exists of either that individual or the ship after 1013.

**Addendum 4113.2:**
&gt; 197 days after initially encountering SCP-4113, a similar high energy gamma flash was detected behind the UEF. After an additional 2 days SCP-4113 was detected on long range visual sensors and the FSF Delivery was dispatched with Dr. Malcolm Page, an expert on Old Norse culture and language from Pallas Athena Seven[[footnote]]This section of the colony is currently used to house all Foundation staff and containment.[[/footnote]].
&gt; 
&gt; When approached, SCP-4113 again slowed and turned to face the approaching ship. Dr. Page was outfitted with an exosuit and the Delivery made a close pass in order to facilitate his transport to SCP-4113. Upon entering SCP-4113&#39;s atmospheric envelope he drifted down onto the deck of SCP-4113. He was then stabbed multiple times by the SCP-4113&#39;s crew. Following this he was stripped of clothing and equipment. His body was then thrown behind the ship where it drifted out of the atmospheric envelope. SCP-4113 then approached the Delivery.
&gt; 
&gt; The Delivery turned and burned back towards the UEF with SCP-4113 in pursuit. After several close passes, the FSF Delivery opened fire on SCP-4113 with its onboard coil-guns. Though SCP-4113 itself suffered no damage, approximately 30 of its crew members were killed in this attack. After this opening volley, SCP-4113&#39;s crew threw a large number of axes and spears at the Delivery.
&gt; 
&gt; The Delivery suffered heavy damage; its outer shell was pierced in several locations. The Delivery&#39;s crew equipped their remaining exosuits and directed sustained fire at the deck of SCP-4113. This directed fire was effective in clearing the deck of SCP-4113, though the invulnerable nature of the craft itself shielded approximately 40 SCP-4113 crewmen from the Delivery&#39;s weapons.
&gt; 
&gt; At this point, due to damage, the Delivery no longer moved under its own power. SCP-4113 maintained a parallel heading. As a consequence of the Delivery&#39;s failing life-support systems, Captain Chance Sarridge ordered his crew to board SCP-4113. He hoped to use SCP-4113&#39;s atmosphere to prolong their chances of rescue. Upon landing on the deck of SCP-4113, the crew members were attacked by the remaining members of SCP-4113&#39;s crew.
&gt; 
&gt; The Delivery&#39;s crew used their handheld plasma lances in melee with SCP-4113&#39;s crew. Archie Flett (ship mechanic), Arina Bogomolov (navigator), and Lawrence Woodall (medic) were killed during this fight. Captain Sarridge and a single enemy combatant survived the encounter and were still engaged in combat when the FSF Hermes arrived. Captain Sarridge then fled SCP-4113 and was rescued by the Hermes.
&gt; 
&gt; The Hermes towed the Delivery back to Pallas Athena&#39;s space dock. SCP-4113 did not follow.
&gt; 
&gt; Upon returning to collect the bodies of both crews, SCP-4113 was no longer present. A gamma flash was detected approximately 15 light minutes away.
