**Item #:** SCP-103-J

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to budget cuts, monitoring of SCP-103-J has been outsourced to Illumination Intelligence Inc., which provides the Foundation with invaluable intelligence for a nominal fee. Similarly, Newton&#39;s Worldwide Orders has been contracted to examine Foundation sites and personnel for SCP-103-J infiltration and influence, and to make alterations as necessary to prevent further breaches.

As of 2006-06-06, Operation Declassify is in full effect. See Addendum 103-J-2 for additional details.

**Description:** SCP-103-J is a &#34;secretive power elite with a globalist agenda&#34; that intends to &#34;eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government&#34;.[[footnote]]New World Order (conspiracy theory). (n.d.) In //Wikipedia//. Retrieved September 18, 2016, from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Order_(conspiracy_theory%29 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Order_(conspiracy_theory)][[/footnote]] Agents of SCP-103-J (collectively designated SCP-103-J-1) present similarly to Foundation agents, except with subtly better cars, control over world affairs, and spouses. Under controlled conditions, SCP-103-J-1 can deadlift an average of 10% more weight than Foundation agents.

SCP-103-J-2 refers to a class of three-sided polygonal figures with largely unexplored esoteric, thaumaturgic, reality-warping, and otherwise spooky properties. Current evidence suggests that SCP-103-J-1 exude SCP-103-J-2 from their sweat glands as a way of marking territory, incorporating them into various objects, locations, and media. The presence of SCP-103-J-2 is the most reliable way of detecting the presence of SCP-103-J. SCP-103-J-2 is sometimes found alongside SCP-103-J-I, which [DAT[[image eye.png height=&#34;9px&#34;]] EXPUNGED].

The primary threat posed by SCP-103-J is poorly understood, as their security is better than ours. It is the opinion of the O5 Council that SCP-103-J poses the risk of an FK-Class domination shift scenario. Destroying SCP-103-J is currently the top priority of the Foundation.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ INPUT CREDENTIALS&#34; hide=&#34;- 123456&#34;]]
The presence of SCP-103-J-2 has been confirmed in many currently-contained anomalies, suggesting that SCP-103-J has infiltrated the Foundation extensively. What follows is photographic evidence to this effect. For additional documentation, please access the [[[Confirmed Sightings]]] list.

**Addendum 103-J-2**
[[collapsible show=&#34;+ INPUT CREDENTIALS&#34; hide=&#34;- hunter2&#34;]]
Operation Declassify was initiated in 2006 with the aim of disrupting SCP-103-J&#39;s operations and neutralizing the threat it poses to the Foundation[[size 20%]]&#39;s ego[[/size]]. The goal was to kidnap, brainwash, and demoralize SCP-103-J-1 instances before killing them. The particular mechanism for this is outlined in Dr. Grayson&#39;s Proposal &#34;Addressing Personnel Shortages Via Forcible Outside Recruitment&#34;.

**Interview 103-J-289**
&gt; **Dr. Grayson:** Ingenious, isn&#39;t it?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-289:** Uh-huh.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Grayson:** You&#39;re already wiped from the public record, and your deaths have already been faked. Your employers took care of that for us.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-289:** Sure.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Grayson:** Nobody will miss you. Much lower risk than those death row inmates that we used to use.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-289:** Right.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Grayson:** And because you&#39;re already adept at survival, we don&#39;t run through so many of you.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-289:** That&#39;s nice.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Grayson:** You really are the perfect disposable personnel. Wouldn&#39;t you agree?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-289:** Dr. Grayson, did you bring me here just to brag about how smart you are?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Grayson:** Y-- No, there&#39;s another reason.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-289:** Alright, what is it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Grayson:** You haven&#39;t been following the etiquette guidelines we assigned you.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-289:** That&#39;s because they&#39;re degrading.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Grayson:** So?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-289:** You actually get a kick out of making us act like that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Grayson:** Just... follow them, or suffer the consequences. Understood?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-289:** //[Sighs loudly, adopts Jersey accent]// You fuckin&#39; got it, doc.
