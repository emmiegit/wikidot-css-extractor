**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6266 is currently placed on Site-94&#39;s east road. The road is blocked to all civilians with the exception of Level 3 staff, who are allowed to operate SCP-6266 in order to ship any anomalous objects to other Foundation Sites.

**Description:** SCP-6266 refers to a standard VCRSS traffic signal with a non-functioning amber light. When a vehicle transverses under SCP-6266 while it is displaying a green light, said vehicle and its contents will spontaneously transport after a bright white flash of light to a location of the driver&#39;s choice.

**Test Logs:** SCP-6266&#39;s research head is Dr. Michael Sefiraph. The majority of tests were conducted by him.

&gt; **Subject:** Researcher Michael Sefiraph
&gt; 
&gt; **Desired Destination:** //Site-19.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Test Record:** Dr. Sefiraph waited for the green light to turn on, and drove under SCP-6266. Subsequently, Dr. Sefiraph and his car were reported at Site-19&#39;s parking lot, and no abnormalities were noticed.
------

&gt; **Subject:** D-8812
&gt; 
&gt; **Desired Destination:** //Site-94&#39;s Parking// while carrying a battery and another functional VCRSS signal.
&gt; 
&gt; **Test Record:** D-8812 drove under SCP-6266 while the anomaly&#39;s green light was on, prior to manifesting on Site-94&#39;s parking lot. Suddenly, the signal within the car began duplicating until the car was buried under traffic signals. Dr. Sefiraph, noticing the danger of the situation, brought a Scranton Reality Anchor from Site-94, which caused all the stoplights to demanifest except the original. D-8812 escaped the vehicle in time. Said stoplight was subsequently contained.

------

&gt; **Subject:** D-8812
&gt; 
&gt; **Desired Destination:** //--Three Portlands-- presumed disregarded by subject; see below.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Test Record:** D-8812 was asked to think about getting to Three Portlands while driving under SCP-6266. After being spontaneously transported, D-8821 and his car were transported 100 meters back onto the same road. He then tried to run over Site-94&#39;s research staff, but couldn&#39;t succeed. The car was then disabled via gunfire by MTFs on the spot, resulting in the car coming to a halt. D-8812 has been replaced in his cell at Site-94.
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** I now understand that testing with this anomaly should only be made with normal staff or, if we find one, with a trustworthy D-Class. — {{Dr. Sefiraph}}

------

&gt; **Subject:** Dr. Cameron Abbett
&gt; 
&gt; **Desired Destination:** //Site-22&#39;s Parking// while carrying a GPS.
&gt; 
&gt; **Test Record:** Dr. Abbett drove onto SCP-6266 while the green light was on, and subsequently spawned within a free slot of Site-22&#39;s parking. GPS recorded that Dr. Abbett drove through Greenland via unknown means, crossed the North Pole, and somehow drove onto Site-22, in Vladivostok, Russia.
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** This is really interesting. It was first believed that the vehicle and passenger re-materialized instantly at the desired destination. However, this test might indicate that subject vehicles have driven conventionally to reach their destinations, despite this contradicting the instantaneous nature of the event. -- {{Dr. Sefiraph}}
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, that&#39;s cool and all but, hum... How the hell do I go back now? -- {{Dr. Abbett}}

------

&gt; **Subject:** Dr. Felix O.U.
&gt; 
&gt; **Desired Destination:** //Eurtec&#39;s streets//, while carrying a mobile Scranton Reality Anchor.
&gt; 
&gt; **Test Record:** Dr. Felix O.U. drove onto SCP-6266 while its green light was on. Results were deemed inconclusive, as Dr. Felix O.U.&#39;s car began levitating and spinning, prior to imploding and disappearing from reality. Dr. Felix O.U.&#39;s camera recorded him lying on a mangled sofa at a scrapyard; this location is currently unknown.
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** It keeps getting weirder and weirder... -- {{Dr. Sefiraph}}

------

&gt; **Subject:** D-8812
&gt; 
&gt; **Desired Destination:** //Unknown.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Test Record:** D-8812 escaped his cell after a containment breach occurred at Site-94. He later stole the keys of Dr. Perk&#39;s car and, having gained knowledge of SCP-6266 via testing, subsequently escaped and drove under SCP-6266 prior to the car&#39;s disappearance. D-8812&#39;s current location is unknown.
&gt; 
------

&gt; **Subject:** Dr. Anna Perk
&gt; 
&gt; **Desired Destination:** //D-8812&#39;s location.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Test Record:** Dr. Anna Perk and a Foundation test car were transported to Marseilles, France. Upon arriving, the car drove into D-8812 and killed him on impact.
&gt; 

------

&gt; **Subject:** Dr. Eric Charles
&gt; 
&gt; **Desired Destination:** //Unknown.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Test Record:** Following a birthday party inside of Site-94, Dr. Charles was noticed driving around while being affected by alcohol. He drove three times around Site-94. In the fourth turn, SCP-6266&#39;s light changed to green and Dr. Charles&#39;s car was spontaneously transported after driving under it, along with him. Dr. Charles was reported at an alcohol rehab center. Since the car was unusable following teleportation, Dr. Charles called a friend for a ride home.
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Contrary to popular belief, this was an intentional test. I just wanted to see what would happen when someone affected by alcohol used SCP-6266. Now we know, thanks to me. —{{Dr. Charles}}

------

&gt; **Subject:** Gallus gallus domesticus (Domestic Chicken)
&gt; 
&gt; **Desired Destination:** //Unknown.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Test Record:** The chicken was placed on a remotely controllable car GPS trackable by SCP-6266&#39;s research team. After the green light, the car rolled under the anomaly and spontaneously teleported. The car was then found in a chicken coop, where the car crashed into it, allowing several chickens to escape from the coop, no chickens were injured. Site-94 paid the coop&#39;s owner for all the damages.
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** I must say, this chicken tried to save his brothers. It&#39;s funny and impressive at the same time. — {{Dr. Sefiraph}}

------

&gt; **Subject:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/aiad-homescreen Coeus.aic][[footnote]]Subject was provided with a provisional, physical robotic prototype adjusted for artificial intelligences.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Desired Destination:** //Unknown[[footnote]]Coeus.aic was asked to think about a place where it would want to be.[[/footnote]].//
&gt; 
&gt; **Test Record:** As asked, Coeus.aic drove the car and passed under the anomaly. However, no teleportation occurred. Instead, its artificial body was found inert and motionless. Coeus.aic was not found anywhere inside the prototype&#39;s memory card. --Coeus.aic&#39;s current state is unknown.--
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Ok, hum, update: Coeus.aic consciousness was found in a microwave at the cafeteria of Site-94. It seems to love his new home. We now have a talking microwave, great. — {{Dr. Sefiraph}}

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Subject:** Researcher Michael Sefiraph

**Desired Destination:** //Going way back.//

**Test Record:** Dr. Sefiraph was successfully transported spontaneously. However, Dr. Sefiraph and his car were not found anywhere and Dr. Sefiraph was reported missing soon after. A few days later, a new prehistoric art drawing dating back to 30,000 BC. has been discovered, possibly related to testing with SCP-6266. All of the archaeologists present when the art was discovered were given Class C amnestics.

**Closing Statement:** Further testing with SCP-6266 is now overruled to avoid any sort of temporal paradox — {{[[[welcome-to-delta-t|Delta-T]]]}}
