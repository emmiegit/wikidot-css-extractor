**Name:** Jayenne / Kim / Lilith / Your Highness

**Gender:** Female

**Age:** --Too goddamn old-- 23

**Security Clearance:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Position:** Gosh, at least take me to dinner first~

**History:**  As you can probably tell from looking at my account, I&#39;ve lurked on the SCP forums since 2018. Five years ago I attempted to post an SCP, but - because I previously lacked the mental capacity to work a washing machine, much less figure out how to actually create an SCP - I unwittingly had the draft sitting in a sandbox for five years rather than actually uploaded to the site. Looking back, its probably better that way. 

I&#39;m a massive nerd, with a strong interest in Biology, Chemistry, Engineering, History, and Demonology. I enjoy using my knowledge in these topics - particularly my knowledge of Anatomy and Biology - to create monsters the likes of which no one has seen before. You must first //learn// the rules of how living things are put together, before you can //break// those rules. I didn&#39;t originally set out to become the &#34;Mother of Monsters&#34;, but upon some introspection and review of my already completed SCPs, I came to realize I had something of a niche. Expect to see more horrific biological manifestations of my fractured psyche as time goes on.

+ [[[SCP-7837]]] -- Eyes In The Sky
After my first SCP went down (7713, an embarrassing clusterfuck I&#39;d rather forget), I was slightly discouraged, but I&#39;m well-known to be a stubborn bitch, so giving up isn&#39;t in the cards for me. The day 7713 got deleted, an image flashed into my mind, of a satellite firing a miles-long cable down from the upper atmosphere, piercing an unaware victim with near-perfect accuracy, before reeling the struggling prey rapidly into the sky, leaving naught a trace behind. I instantly knew I&#39;d struck gold.

Satellites are one of those pieces of technology that&#39;s remarkably absent from the public consciousness, despite how impressive they are in terms of engineering and technology. A satellite must be able to survive in space for //15 years// without //ever// suffering a mechanical failure, because once launched, a satellite can never be repaired. They&#39;re easily some of the most technologically advanced and durable machines mankind has ever built, able to withstand ludicrous temperatures on both ends of the spectrum, radiation bombardment, and a complete absence of air pressure. Satellites have unquestionably changed our society for the better... but what if they were against us? Thousands upon thousands of satellites are floating in the sky as you read this... what if they&#39;re watching your every move? What if they&#39;re following you, waiting until you&#39;re alone and unprotected so they can eat you alive? The Eyes In The Sky are watching, waiting, //hungering//...

Overall I&#39;m overjoyed with how 7837 turned out in the end. I somehow struck gold on my first SCP, knocked the concept out of the park, and now it serves as this beacon of success that I can&#39;t seem to reach again - at least if we&#39;re going by upvotes. I know upvotes aren&#39;t a good metric for success, but I can&#39;t help getting a little frustrated at the numbers on 7032 and 6047. 

+ [[[SCP-7032]]] -- Sister Sanguine
After the initial success of 7837, I was excited to write another article, this time flexing more of my narrative and character-writing muscles. The catalyst for this idea was, much like 7837, a perfectly-formed mental image of the entity in question: a humanoid leech dressed in the garb of a nun. The moment I saw it in my mind&#39;s eye, I knew I had to do it. 

There&#39;s just something so evocative about the image of 7032. Undoubtedly female in body, but with nothing resembling a face. Its pitch-black skin evokes the image of a latex bodysuit, and yet it dresses like a nun. The contrast between sensuality and sanctity really drew me to the concept, and drew me waaaaaaay out of my comfort zone in the process.

The story for this one was actually revised heavily about 5 times, and it still turned out longer and a bit clunkier than I originally hoped it would. Overall, I&#39;m still proud of 7032, and I love Maeve as a character, but in hindsight I feel I still lack the experience to truly nail a concept as strange and complex as this. 

+ [[[SCP-6047]]] -- Walks Beneath Roses
6047 was not my first idea after 7032. Rather, I had two other concepts half-finished, but ended up pseudo-scrapping one and putting the other on the back-burner. The latter, you&#39;ll definitely be seeing soon. 6047 was originally inspired by the movie //Annihilation//, and more specifically by the mixed-breed flowers the research team discover shortly before the Gator attack. Hilariously, everyone who&#39;s read 6047 has said they thought it was //actually// inspired by Swamp Thing, despite me literally never reading comics. Funny how that works. Nonetheless, I&#39;ve always been a huge botany nerd, so a chance to flex my muscles and dish out some obscure plant knowledge was too good to pass up. 

6047-1&#39;s appearance was the first thing set in stone after the amalgamated flowers. I wanted to turn the concept of an alluring Dryad on its head and make the entity a veritable Adonis of a male, rather than an attractive female. I didn&#39;t really touch on attraction at all in the story itself, and that&#39;s because it was originally going to be alot more &#34;culty&#34; and have 6047-1 as a sort of &#34;Incubus&#34; figure. The reason I ditched this idea is because I remembered that //tentacle hentai// was a thing, and I didn&#39;t want people getting those kinds of ideas. The idea to set the story in Costa Rica came from a vacation I&#39;d taken there a few years previous. Its so beautiful it feels like another planet. Its a place everyone should go at least once in their life if they&#39;re financially capable of doing so. Some of the best food I&#39;d ever eaten, too.

I am really happy with how 6047 came out in the end, even if its not as dark and scary as the stories I typically prefer writing. This will probably be the most &#34;lighthearted&#34; thing y&#39;all ever see from me though, so hold onto your fuckin pants.

+ [[[SCP-7038]]] -- Mother of Miseries

Well guys, I kept my promise. 6047 was some nice breathing room, but now its time to delve into the darkness again with the most fucked-up thing I&#39;ve ever written. Of course, if you know me, you know I don&#39;t write such disturbing things solely for the sake of being disturbing. This story was originally motivated by my desire to explore a genre of horror few people dare to attempt: taking something typically fetishized or cherished and warping it into horror. Along with that, I blended in my existential fears of a wasted life, the horrors of factory farming, and my irrational fear of children. You can tell this is gonna be such a heartwarming ride already. 

SCP-7038&#39;s concept and appearance was heavily inspired by biblical interpretations of Lilith, and the idea of a &#34;mother of monsters&#34; (sound familiar?) Add in a dash of Goetic Demonology, some basic inspiration from the Tyranids from 40K and the Xenomorph Queen from Alien, and you have yourself a traumatized anomaly that&#39;s known no other life than the hell it exists in every day. All things considered her design is relatively tame by my standards, mostly because I wanted the horror of the piece to come more from the circumstances of her existence than her appearance itself. Story was my main focus on this SCP, and I spared no mental expense when it came to throwing critters at it. 

Overall, 7038 is -- in my opinion -- my best work //so far//, but I&#39;m not the type to settle down after cranking out a banger like this. Just you wait, I&#39;m already trying to top myself again.
