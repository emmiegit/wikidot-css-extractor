2023 marks 12 years of the SCP Wiki Art Exchange! The annual art exchange is a chance for artists and authors of different mediums to create all sorts of art including SCP articles, tales, art, crafts, songs, poems, etc. for fellow members of the community. Works are generally of the expectation to be related to SCP or the SCP universe in some form. Whether it be on an SCP they created, an SCP character, or just an SCP they enjoy, the art exchange is a chance for anyone to show their creativity to the whole site.

As of the time of posting the site news, the art exchange for this year is yet to be posted. Keep your eyes peeled and sign up if you&#39;re interested! To see a history of art exchange projects, check out the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art-exchange-hub|art exchange hub]]]. Sign-ups start on November 15th, and close on November 23rd. We look forward to seeing you there!

[[[anthology-2023-hub|Anthology 2023]]] is here! A continuation of [[[scp-anthology-hub|SCP Anthology]]], this is a collection of works that have been posted every day over the month of October. Unlike the previous anthology, this one was a crossover between SCP and our sister site [[[https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/|The Wanderer&#39;s Library]]]. Every work was assigned a tarot card to use as a theme for the article. If you are interested in reading it, we encourage you to check out the hub! We also completed an interview with its organizer, [[*user tyumen]], to get a behind the scenes perspective on this year&#39;s Anthology. You can read it below!
&gt; What inspired this anthology to be a cross between SCP and Wanderer’s Library?
The WL and the SCP wiki are perfect sister sites - the SCP wiki&#39;s restrictions in the form of format and lore create new avenues for creativity and expansive stories, while the WL&#39;s freeing lack of restrictions makes it a great place for no-holds-barred internet literature. I&#39;ve wanted to organize a community project for a while now, and I thought this would be a great opportunity to celebrate the collaborative spirit of and between both sites.
&gt; What was the inspiration for the tarot theme? Was there a deeper meaning behind it?
I&#39;ve had a passing interest in the Tarot for a while now, a passing interest that over the course of the project has turned into a bit of a hobby - my inspiration for choosing it as a theme came from the interpretive aspect of Tarot reading, how the imagery on a card could lead one to multiple different conclusions and the potential the cards hold as prompts for storytelling. Honestly, though, there wasn&#39;t a deeper meaning than that to the choice of theme - I just thought it would be cool and fun. 
&gt; If another anthology happens in the future, would you have any tips for the authors, artists, and organizers for it?
Start early. A lot of the problems I faced (tepid reception to a fundraiser, last-minute scrambles to get something ready to post) could have been remedied if I had just prepared for them much, much earlier. If you&#39;re not chronically prone to procrastination like I am, this goes without saying! On a more positive note, though, I seriously could not have gotten this project off the ground without talking to people - the participants, SCP and WL staff, and S D Locke, the originator of the whole Anthology idea - and taking the guidance they gave me into account. This also goes without saying, but it&#39;s what helped me the most in organizing all this.
&gt;  I just have one more question for you. Is there anything else you would like to say to the readers out there?
Well, as of posting this interview October may be over, but please do check out all of our entries - especially the ones on WL under +20 and the SCPs! All of our writers did a phenomenal job, especially given the time constraints. Also, I&#39;d like to give a special shout-out to our artists: EstrellaYoshte/Sywaves, who created our beautiful theme and logo; syuzhet, who provided a whopping eleven out of eighteen card illustrations; SLAVIIIK, who contributed two; Stygian Blue, who in addition to writing our first piece created a painting for our third; Valdevia; Nylo (el Lobo); SunnySundays; and Salllllty_water!

The Vietnamese SCP branch is hosting [[[http://scp-vn.wikidot.com/trinitycon2023|Trinitycon]]]! In this contest, participants would submit words of their choice to the contest organizers, and then authors would write a story inspired by three of these words chosen at random. This was inspired by a type of story popular in the Vietnamese online writing community called &#34;three-topic&#34; stories, where stories are written based off of three words. Posting started on October 16th, and will close on December 17th. We encourage you to check it out!
