    Kansas City&#39;s public transportation is scattered at best, but if you&#39;re planning to only stay downtown, there are several options:

    **Streetcar**: Entirely free, the KC Streetcar runs for two miles, from Crown Center to the River Market. This is your best option if you just wanna hit the popular spots. //Hours: 6 am-12 am Mon-Thu, 6 am-1 am Fri, 7 am-1 am Sat, 7 am-11 pm Sun//.

    **RideKC**: KC&#39;s bus system has multiple routes in the metropolitan area, with coverage becoming thinner the further away from downtown you go. Day passes are available, which allow unlimited rides until midnight. Single-day passes are $3, three-day passes are $8. These are probably the best bang for your buck if you&#39;re only passing through. There&#39;s also a RideKC app, which lets you track when the next bus will be nearby; as with any online service, you&#39;ll have to weigh the risks and decide for yourself if it&#39;s worth it. RideKC also offers park-and-ride in select locations, as well as electric bikes for $2/hour or $5/day.

    **Bellis**: Of course, if you&#39;re too worried to take public transit, you can always get a ride with one of us. Focus on the word &#34;Bellis,&#34; and keep it in your mind for as long as you can. If we&#39;re available, one of us will respond in kind and head your way.

    Kansas City is definitely big, but not quite big enough for you to remain totally unnoticed anywhere you go. Avoid drawing unnecessary attention, and do whatever you can to try to remain inconspicuous. This isn&#39;t NYC: people are going to do something if they feel like you don&#39;t belong.
 _
As such, there are several precautions which should be taken:
* __Casual Clothing__: In general, a pair of jeans and a plain-colored t-shirt should get you by.
* __Relaxed Demeanor__: Try not to appear too closed-off. If someone wants to engage in small talk, let them; they&#39;ll remember you more if you don&#39;t.
* __Moving with Purpose__: Always look like you know where you&#39;re going, even if you&#39;re completely lost. People will be more likely to approach if you look confused.
 _
Now, as far as the worst case scenario—finding yourself in the presence of a hostile agent—your best course of action is to attempt to evade them without drawing attention. If this is impossible, you should attempt to blend into your surroundings as best as you can until escape becomes an option. __**NEVER**__ attempt to directly engage a hostile agent: they are almost certainly better prepared than you are, and will likely kill if they feel threatened. Additionally, __**DO NOT**__ attempt to make mental contact with anyone while in the presence of a hostile agent: many agents possess the means to detect the origin of these sorts of communications, and you are only increasing the chance of being found out.

When in public spaces, it is critically important that you only communicate to other members through written and verbal means. __**DO NOT**__ attempt to establish mental contact in public; no matter how safe it may seem, there is always a nonzero chance of blowing your cover.
 _
In addition, be sure to keep mental contact limited, even in private areas. The more prolonged a conversation, the greater likelihood it gets pinpointed by unwelcome guests.
 _
In the event of an emergency, __**DO NOT**__ contact the police. This will only open you up to the possibility of being noticed. Instead, contact one of us. If in public, do so via phone or text; if in private, do so via mental contact.
 _
As always, look out for one another. We&#39;re stronger together than we are alone.
