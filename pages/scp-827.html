**Item #:** SCP-827

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Site 827 has been established at the location of SCP-827&#39;s discovery. For the purposes of the Foundation, SCP-827 has been outfitted with a specialized cell reactor that allows for introduction of samples and removal of their products. Personnel actively interacting with SCP-827 are to wear full Level-C or higher Hazmat gear.

Samples introduced into SCP-827 require approval of  project director. Samples from only one individual at a time are to be introduced to ensure there is no genetic cross-contamination. All samples are to be screened for genetic chimerism. In the event that more than one distinct genetic sample is introduced to SCP-827, the sample is to be removed using procedure 827-Hari and incinerated. 

Tissue from the central nervous system is not to be used in SCP-827 tests following Incident 827-██.

**Description:** SCP-827 is a semi-solid mass of biologically active human stem cells. SCP-827 is capable of self-renewal and is totipotent, with cells replacing themselves at a rate of approximately 200,000 cycles of mitosis per day, with roughly the same amount dying off per day; at time of writing, SCP-827&#39;s mass is currently 353kg, and remains stable. 

When a sample of human organ tissue is introduced to SCP-827&#39;s mass, it is broken down and assimilated into the mass using a unique enzyme. Following this, SCP-827&#39;s cells will enter an active state and will begin to generate copies of the organs from which the tissue originated. These organs, designated SCP-827-A, differ from their original purpose in drastic ways; introduction of muscular tissue, for example, has resulted in full muscular systems developing and attempting to escape SCP-827, while introduction of a human jaw has resulted in what was termed a &#34;broken-tooth tree&#34;, a plant-like structure with a trunk of muscular tissue with branches made from malformed jaws. Assuming that SCP-827-A instances are remaining and still in contact after a period of approximately 2-3 days, the instances will be digested and re-assimilated into SCP-827&#39;s mass.

SCP-827 is only capable of assimilating human tissues. Attempts to introduce non-human tissues, including hair from lower primates and bone samples of extinct humanoids, has resulted in a deterioration of health in SCP-827. Furthermore, all liquid samples are rejected by SCP-827.

**Addendum: Sample Log**

**Sample:** Part of a human liver, donated by Dr. Ming. 
**Note:** Dr. Ming was suffering from liver failure, and due to a rare blood type, donated on the condition that the resultant organ be transplanted back into him.
**Result:** After 12 hours, SCP-827 produced one apparently healthy human liver matching Dr. Ming&#39;s blood type. Transplant was successful; however, the SCP-827-A instance was incapable of producing bile or processing alcohol. Instead, it acted similar to a liver found in a human fetus, producing red blood cells. Dr. Ming developed primary polycythemia, and eventually died due to his condition.

**Sample:**  One pelvis and two femurs.
**Result:** 7 hours after introduction, the surface of SCP-827 calcified entirely. Researchers present broke through the calcium shell, exposing the resultant SCP-827-A instance to the air. SCP-827-A instance resembled a human pelvis, but with a single joint where the coccyx would be located, with a single leg growing out of it. The instance had developed musculature due to improper cleaning procedures. Approximately 19 minutes after exposure, the instance was broken down by SCP-827. 

**Sample:** One male human head, with all tissue intact. Donor was a civilian, decapitated in an industrial accident.
**Result:** Sample was digested in 2 hours. 36 hours later, resultant SCP-827-A instance was fully formed; subject was humanoid in appearance, but severely malformed. Skull had been flattened out in a mushroom-like shape to account for a brain that had been unfolded and spread flat. Furthermore, the intestines of the SCP-827-A instance had unraveled, but the spinal column was too weak to support it and collapsed when removed from SCP-827, killing the instance. Before removal, the instance wrote the letter &#34;G&#34; several times in an attempt to communicate.

**Sample:** Two sets of bones taken from human hands, from two different donors
**Result:** A vaguely serpentine instance of SCP-827-A was created, assembled entirely from the various bones found in the human hand. The instance was capable of independent locomotion, and began growing musculature and skin resembling that of a human arm. The instance escaped SCP-827 and was capable of surviving for six days despite the lack of any digestive or respiratory system before being neutralized by a security agent.

**Sample:** One human brain.
**Result:** After 18 hours, SCP-827 produced a reconstruction of a nervous system, but anomalous in construction; the brain was triple-lobed, and appeared to be built for a hexapodal humanoid, with four arms and two legs. Appeared to be self-sustaining within SCP-827. Upon removal from SCP-827, the instance expired.

**Addendum: Recovery Log:** 

SCP-827 was recovered at the lab of one Dr. George Farrow in [REDACTED], Idaho, USA. Dr. Farrow had disappeared after being diagnosed with malignant pancreatic and breast cancers, and was expected to live less than six months. According to excerpts from Dr. Farrow&#39;s personal notes, he was intending to rejuvenate his organs with self-administered stem cell therapy. It is unknown if SCP-827 was the result of that therapy, or the method Dr. Farrow used. 

The following are excerpts of notes taken by Dr. Farrow shortly before his disappearance.

&gt; The cancer&#39;s not going away; the therapy should be working! Instead, there are strange lumps all over my skin, but the doctor says they&#39;re not tumors; they&#39;re not even melanomas or moles. They&#39;re just little humps of flesh. I tried lancing them like a boil, but the one on my shoulder ate the needle; it broke off within the damn thing. Will attempt excision soon.
&gt; 
&gt; All samples have been excised; they seem to be the same consistency as the soup[[footnote]] Dr. Farrow uses this term repeatedly in his notes to refer to the stem cells he had been using to treat himself. [[/footnote]]. I placed them in a petri dish, and they conglomerated into one mass. They&#39;re completely undifferentiated now, despite being taken from all over my body. I decided to try putting a bit of hair I had saved into it, and it digested it quicker than anything I&#39;d ever seen. I&#39;ve locked it in the cell incubator for the time being.
&gt; 
&gt; I checked on the sample again. It had grown hair all over itself, and it was... I incinerated the damn thing. Now I have even more lumps on my skin; it&#39;s like they grow overnight. Insulin levels seem to be stabilizing, at any rate. Maybe the cancer&#39;s finally going away?

&gt; I collapsed today, from- I don&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this- insulin shock. The doctors said that it was like the entire pancreas just reset itself and released a massive amount of the stuff. I&#39;m writing this from the hospital bed, and I feel fine; the screening said that the cancer was __GONE__. Meanwhile, they found even more of those damn lumps on my skin; the lab tecs are saying they&#39;re some kind of stem cell. That explains the hair thing, I guess. 
&gt; 
&gt; Will stop therapy as soon as I get back home.
 
&gt; I started incinerating the soup today. About 50% of the cells are gone, but they&#39;re replacing themselves relatively fast. Shouldn&#39;t be a problem. 
&gt; 
&gt; I just hit myself in the throat by accident. Hurt my thyroid. Only problem is, I had my thyroid removed back in 1992. What&#39;s more, it feels swollen. What&#39;s going on? 

&gt; More of the lumps, and the soup won&#39;t stop growing. Dammit dammit dammit. I&#39;ve just started cutting them off and throwing them into the soup so it&#39;s easier to get rid of all at once. I&#39;m thinking of saving a small sample for later --analasys-- --analayss-- analysis 

&gt; My entire arm is one giant, soupy lump. And it&#39;s rotting. Too many waste products. I gotta agitate it somehow. I tried the egg beater, and that seems to be working well. For now.

&gt; The entire left side of my body is stem cells. They&#39;re useless, but I seem to have full brain function. Got to agitate it constantly, maybe I should just stick it all in that big cell reactor.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried cutting off my arm, or what&#39;s left of it. It ate the knife. I can feel it cutting through a second esophagus. 

&gt; My arm just reconstituted itself. 
&gt; 
&gt; So much blood. Too many toes.
