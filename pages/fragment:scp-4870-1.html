**Special Containment Procedures:** No iteration of this file is allowed on Site-17 servers at this time. All documentation pertaining to SCP-4870 may only be accessed on different Sites&#39; servers until further notice. Moreover, data servers at Site-17 are to be modified with a unique digital signature that will prohibit access to documents that could potentially be modified by SCP-4870.

All SCP-4870-1 instances discovered are to be destroyed or reverted to unaffected iterations if possible. Research into the cause of SCP-4870 is still underway and any discoveries on the subject are to be brought to Dr. Jaskes&#39; attention at once. All potential research inquiries regarding the Neutralization of SCP-4870 are to be considered, as no current means to do so has yet been found.

If found, SCP-4870-2 is to be contained at once. Due to the unknown and potentially hazardous nature of SCP-4870-2, extreme caution is to be exercised during this process.

**Description:** SCP-4870 is a phenomenon affecting Site-17 by which the content of certain documents physically present or digitally accessed at the Site, thereafter designated SCP-4870-1, have a chance of being anomalously altered to include text suggesting the existence of a specimen of //Gopherus Polyphemus//[[footnote]]Gopher Tortoise.[[/footnote]], designated SCP-4870-2, at or near Site-17.

Documents susceptible to SCP-4870 commonly share one or more of the following attributes:
* Cover topics of or relating to herpetology[[footnote]]The scientific study of turtles and tortoises.[[/footnote]] or chelonian entities   
* Directly name or refer to Site-17
* Are written or compiled before 1998
* Contain the words &#39;substantially,&#39; &#39;densest,&#39; or &#39;subterranean&#39;

The contents of SCP-4870-1 “write-ins” are minor, consisting of brief mentions of SCP-4870-2, phrased in a way that makes the writer appear fond of SCP-4870-2 and refer to it in a positive manner.

Beyond the text added by SCP-4870, the original content of SCP-4870-1 instances remains unaltered. Digital records, printed text, and even handwriting is subject to SCP-4870&#39;s effects if they should meet the above conditions. (See Addendum 4870-A) Susceptible documents are affected at a rate of an average of three documents per week, though the changes appear to be made instantaneously.

To date SCP-4870-2 has not been discovered, if it indeed exists.
