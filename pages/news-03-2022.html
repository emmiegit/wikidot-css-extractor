++ INTCON&#39;s Survey has Closed!
[[span class=&#34;s-title&#34;]]//As INT&#39;s survey for their contest has come to a close, we have spoken with their master administrator as well as other site members for their thoughts!//[[/span]]
[[/=]]

Today, [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/ SCP-INT]’s newest survey focused on their work-in-progress contest has ended. We have researched and interviewed some -INT Staff and -INT Members from multiple branches asking for their thoughts on this contest that promised to //“bring people from all international branches together for a while again.”//

Lekter - Master Admin of -INT, has joined us to share some of his works and thoughts on this contest. When asked about the reason that INTCON started, Lekter showed his thoughts about contests in their first place -- //“Contests are always important events in pretty much every SCP community”//, and the goal of SCP-INT: //“To create opportunities for authors from everywhere around the world to discover each other&#39;s personality, culture and writing practices.”// 

INTCON is a big project that is open for members coming from multiple branches. That being said, inequality is a major problem for this type of contest: //“We need to find something where the winner won&#39;t just be an author from one of the branches with the biggest user base.”// This and many other problems have been addressed by -INT Staff for two years, //“To find something that can encompass all branches without major inequalities.”//

Many members have expressed their concerns about the contest, KirQ - Master Admin of -VN, concerned that language barrier would cause problems; however, Lekter has assured us that language barrier may not be a big issue: //“It will, of course, be a problem for some like in all international events in the world, but since -INT&#39;s default language is English everybody should be able to understand each other at least enough to chat.”//

Translators can also participate in the contest, //“Every possibility involves translation at some point - either to translate articles from their home branch to -INT for the contest or to translate contest entries to individual branches during it or when it&#39;s done”// - said Lekter. -INT also stated that //“The implication of unofficial branches and underrepresented languages will depend on the contest&#39;s structure [...] but we&#39;ll do our best not to exclude anyone from the process and leave an option open for people who can&#39;t participate as part of an official branch.”//

Members of -INT are hyped about the contest, Irina Bougainvillea - Admin of VN, asks: //&#34;Why shouldn&#39;t we do this right now? The -INT community is flourishing with creativity, and as far as I know, we have enough resources to organize such an event. We&#39;d better take the chance when it&#39;s still the right time.”// SamScript from -ZH-TR also shared the same thought: //“I think it&#39;s a good chance for the -INT community to promote itself and enhance the cross-branch interaction.”//

Some of our interviewees also share their recommendations and wishes for the contest. //“For me, knowing and learning about cultures from other branches are undoubtedly intriguing and fascinating. If -INT is holding a contest on such issue, it is surely a thing I will be into.”// - SamScript. KirQ on the other hand hopes that this contest can help create many more creative creations since //“[...] other than the translation, there&#39;s nothing to attract me.”//

Asked about their predictions on turnout, KirQ believes that //“[...] there will be a lot of authors from other branches participating in this contest. Looking back at our Vietnamese branch, we will definitely join this contest-- we were only recognized as an official branch recently so this is a great chance for us to create more relationships between other branches and learn from them.”// SamScript also shared that he //“[...] personally would like to lead a team to join [...]”// if the topic and rules interest him. 

//“From my experience in hosting the 100-VN Contest -- aka the first contest in -VN -- I can assure that organizing contests is an amazing way to bring the community together, raise awareness and discover new talents. I would like to imagine that after INTCON, more members from all branches will get to know -INT more and start to contribute. That way, we can also strengthen the sense of community among -INT members.”// - Bougainvillea

Lekter also wanted to remind us of something very important to keep in mind:
&gt; “-INT is not only for translators! It&#39;s thanks to them that we have content from all branches available in English at the same place, but -INT also aims to bring authors and curious observers together. We have branch lore presentations to allow for various inspiration, channels for cross-branch projects, and we would like to further develop lore discovery pages and events in the future. Ideally, everyone should find something interesting for them on -INT (and suggestions from authors and translators are always welcome).”

Let&#39;s hope that INTCON will bring branches together and create a dynamic, joyful community of authors, translators, readers, and members!

Late January came with a new announcement, the SCP Wiki was having another team contest! After just wrapping up with the season of gift-giving, many were excited to get back together to butt heads once more in a race of writing and talent. [[[department-contest|Department-Con 2022]]], named for the theme of people creating and/or writing for a mostly unused department in the SCP Foundation, is being run by the user Rounderhouse and is being backed by the Community Outreach staff team as an official site contest. The host stated that he had the idea for running the contest a while back but was unable to get to it until two years later when becoming a Junior Staff sparked the idea once more.

We began with a roaring twist as the contest announced only teams of three would be allowed into the contest, a change to hopefully introduce more creative thinking among members. While initially met with confusion and some disagreement, it seemed to inspire more interest in participation. Posting began on January 21st, and members were given until February 11th to form a team and add themselves to the list. Once posting started on the 12th, everyone who signed up was solidified as a participant, and teams could no longer be changed. At that point, everyone was on their way. They had until March 11th -28 days from then- to wrap up their new department!

Now Deptcon is coming to its end, and there are many teams out there who posted some fantastic works and pushed it to that finish line. With 23 eligible teams, we are very excited to move onto our dedicated voting period. The interest peaked with Deptcon as it reached a soaring 56 total teams - nearly double the 27 that the last team contest, Canon Renaissance. Unfortunately, that interest did come with a few hiccups, as the posting period had to be extended due to a lack of eligible teams. As you may have noticed, the original posting date was March 11th. After receiving many requests for more time, it was pushed back an extra week in hopes of getting more out of it.

After asking a few eligible team captains their thoughts on the extension, it seemed incredibly useful for those worried about time. Some even stated that they would have never been eligible without the extension. RadiantGold, captain of the team &#39;Bug City&#39;, even went as far as to say that //&#34;The extension was invaluable to us[...]&#34;//. Detailing how their team was struggling to meet the earlier deadline, worried they would lose quality without one. Many others agreed and expressed gratitude for the consideration of more time.

The results have brought on a flurry of entertaining new departments to the wiki. On one hand, we have the Logistics and Transportation Department who state that //&#34;The SCP Foundation is an organization that requires many logistics to keep things moving; our department focuses on the more niche, lesser-known side of things, and how more ordinary people of a rather extraordinary group keep things moving&#34;// and on the other, we have departments like the Department of Eidophysics who explain that //&#34;In this world, ghosts are normal, but they must follow a new set of laws of physics. When they don’t, the Department of Eidophysics fixes the problem.&#34;// With so many options including these, you are sure to find something that you will genuinely enjoy.

Now that our teams have had plenty of time to post their entries, we encourage everyone to get involved by reading and voting! Congratulations to our teams for a highly productive contest. Happy reading, SCP!

++ The Riemann Conjecture
[[span class=&#34;s-title&#34;]]//I&#39;m Technically Following The Rules//[[/span]]
[[/=]]

In 1998,  the first of two papers detailing a years-long effort to measure the deacceleration of the universe was released. The scientific community was long aware that the universe was slowing down since the Big Bang, and that it would one day collapse in upon itself due to the gravitational attraction of matter. It was only a matter of time.

Instead, they found that not only was the universe accelerating, but //expanding//.

Fucking wild, right?

Today we know the reason for this is dark energy - some mysterious thing that’s most of the universe and we know fuck-all about it. It can probably be modeled as a liquid?

There are billions of dollars going into dark energy research and it has captured the hearts and minds of at least a handful of people. Theories abound about what it is, how it came to be, and most importantly, //why is it?//

Because dark energy is stupid. It’s dumb, there’s no reason for it to exist, it doesn’t make any sense. And yet, here we are, it’s real, and it is endlessly fascinating.

There are a lot of science and mathematics-based SCPs. Personally, I think most of them are bad.

Writing carries with it a lot of burdens that the real world doesn’t. Writing fiction requires justification in a way that the real world doesn’t. If I decide that 70% of the universe is comprised of dark energy in my Author Avatar fanfic, I have to justify why I’m doing this. It doesn’t have to be a scientific justification, mind you - but it needs to //do// something. Contribute to world-building, characterisation, setting, whatever. And if it’s the focus of my Author Avatar fanfic, then there better be a damn good reason for it.

But all the justification that the real world needs is that //it is//. The little particles of quantum mechanics aren’t interesting in and of themselves - what’s interesting is that this is the way the universe works, common sense be damned.

Getting back to the SCPs - I find that a lot of them try and back into being interesting by taking an unexplained thing and then coming up with an explanation. And I think this doesn’t work because a lot of scientific mysteries are only really interesting because they //do// exist, and we want to know why. But if the focus of the article is that “here is the solution to the mystery” - well, then, that’s not inherently exciting because it’s not really the solution.

I guess what I’m getting at here is that if you set out to write an article about what the truth behind some longstanding science or mathematical mystery, make sure that you don’t rely too much on the mystery itself existing. Use it to set expectations, build tension, but at the end of the day it needs to stand on its own. 

There are some great examples of this - SCP-1313 is not a relevant example, but it is the best maths article on the site, and SCP-4946 and SCP-3272 are both delights that use math and physics in interesting ways. There are mathematics and physics tags too! Take them for a spin, see if you find anything fun!

SCP-033 goes in a different direction - instead of taking an outstanding problem and trying to back in to an explanation, it throws literally everything out the window and then stomps on the ashes[[footnote]]the current rating is higher than all of my SCPs put together, it can take the heat[[/footnote]]. This is problematic for other reasons, notably that //that’s not how that works// and //numbers are just things that operators act on and it doesn’t even bother to define any axioms -//

&gt; Oh, trying to track down how I started drawing is a little bit complicated, but I&#39;d say it started thanks to my mother, who likes to draw as a hobby when she&#39;s bored; back then, around 2009 or 2010, when we were at church, I&#39;d ask my mother to draw something and then try to draw it again myself.
&gt; 
&gt; I found drawing something relaxing, and started to draw things from my imagination every time I felt stressed or bored.
&gt; 
&gt; It then became something stronger when I started seeing old paintings and illustrations from books I had; I wished to draw like them, and started to draw because I liked to do it rather than because I had nothing else to do.
&gt; 
&gt; When I first discovered the SCP Foundation, circa 2018, I got hooked on the concept, and the drawings of several SCP articles came almost naturally; I think my very first SCP drawing was the [[[scp-1155|Predatory Street Art]]], although it&#39;s pretty much lost at this point, and I never really showed it to anyone because I had no contact with the community yet.

Seems you have quite the history with drawing, and you&#39;ve certainly built up your repertoire with your works. To use a specific artwork as an example, your SCP-ES-137 piece, what inspired you to work on this piece and what was your process making it/your artistic process in general?

&gt; This drawing is part of a small series of drawings, called &#34;Condensed SCPs&#34;; I&#39;d draw an SCP per day for one month to both create more content that draws the attention of people (no pun intended) and practice my art skills. I guess I could say the article itself was my inspiration, not only because it&#39;s fanart of that article, but also because it presented some concepts that I thought could fit and tie together in the form of a drawing.
&gt; 
&gt; The artistic process was quite normal and really fun; I read the article and tried to come up with an idea that could summarize an important part of the article, if not the article itself. This was not the exception, but I tried to take a more metaphorical way to show it.
&gt; 
&gt; In this case, the broken heart represents the SCP itself: a boy who lives confined in a building because everyone he befriends disappears. He&#39;s inside a door lock to show he&#39;s pretty much locked down, but the door lock also represents her cat, Lupe, who in my head-canon is responsible for his anomalous effects. His cat is constantly trying to keep him locked, taking advantage of its fear to socialize and making him feel comfortable within his own confinement, expressed by a smug look to the broken heart from a superior position. The heart is dripping, representing tears, but the liquid goes up instead of down, implying that it&#39;s actually upside down, the same way his life is (&#34;being upside down&#34; is a common expression in Mexico to say that something is in a really bad condition, particularly chaotic).
&gt; 
&gt; I tried to emphasize the minimalism of the piece to show that, despite its a complex situation, the Foundation only takes it as &#34;a boy who makes his friends disappear&#34; and nothing more beyond that.

Wow, I appreciate the in-depth explanation! Lots of thought goes into your artworks, especially under certain constraints. With that in-mind, how would you say your artistic
process in general?

Wow, I appreciate the in-depth explanation! Lots of thought goes into your artworks, especially under certain constraints. With that in-mind, how would you say your artistic process and style/styles have developed into their current forms, and how do you believe they will develop in the future?

&gt; My style used to be very... nit-picky, I suppose I would describe it? I would spend a LOT of time striving for perfection, searching for ways to make sure it looked as clean as humanely possible, and as pleasing to the eye as can be. However, over the years, I&#39;ve learned to loosen up on my art a ton, and it has definitely changed my artwork for the better by making things far less stressful and focusing on what I love doing, versus striving for a perfection that will only turn art into a chore. I hope to continue to improve, while still teaching myself to let go of perfection, and implement more of what I personally enjoy as an artist :)

With the styles you&#39;ve developed, which artists inspire you, both off and potentially on the wiki?

&gt; Hmm, complicated question. I think all my current art styles started and developed because I wanted to show a story or transmit a feeling in a particular way that I thought could be expressed nicely in a particular style, or with a particular mindset. For example, I&#39;ve been developing my minimal style because I like the idea of telling a story without really telling it; drawings with few details, sometimes mere silhouettes, that can depict a feeling or landscape in such a clean way that other details may not be necessary. Following that idea, I think that my future art styles might not change that much; I might learn new ones, as I&#39;m currently trying with paint-like styles of drawing, but I don&#39;t think the previous art styles are going to change in terms of purpose or intention, and most likely are only going to change in terms of the technical aspect.

Makes enough sense. Which artists in-particular inspire you and your work, both off and potentially on the wiki?

&gt; I usually get inspiration from artistic movements, such as pop art, vintage/retro art, or old-school minimalism, but if I had to mention an artist, I&#39;d say the art of Shepard Fairey (from outside of the Foundation) and Dc_Yerko, nihonio and Amai (from inside the Foundation) have inspired or strongly influenced the way I draw today. Its a little bit curious and sort of hard to process, but most of my artistic development referring to visual arts has happened within, and thanks to the SCP Foundation community since 2019!

++ SCiPTEMBER Interview

+++++ Featuring: Aethris
+++++ Interviewer: Elenee FishTruck

[[/=]]

Heya, Aethris! SCiPTEMBER was an amazing success, and brought artists and authors alike together. However, before we get into it, you have a track-record as an amazing artist yourself. How did you start producing SCP art, and what about the wiki makes it so appealing to you?

&gt; Around... July 2018? Something around that? I first heard of SCP from Fredrik Knudsen&#39;s Down the Rabbit Hole series, specifically the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKeI1xbJNtw SCP episode]. I got so fascinated that I stopped the video halfway and went to read the site myself, and have honestly still not finished watching that video to this day. SCP really resonated with me, it fit into all the types of things I enjoy reading: a bit of urban fantasy, a bit of sci fi, action, and adventure. Before finding the site I never really did much fan art, but the stories inspired me so much that I felt I couldn&#39;t hold these pictures in my brain anymore, I had to make them. My first SCP fan arts were done with a mouse on FireAlpaca.

From such humble beginnings, you&#39;ve made some excellent stuff, and assembled this great project! How did you come up with Sciptember and its various prompts?

&gt; I love art challenges, despite not being very good at finishing them myself. I did Swordtember last year and Inktober the year before. I wanted to make an SCP challenge for everyone, not just for the artists, and I wanted it to also have a degree of freedom and not be tied to specific articles, much like how other art challenges simply give you a prompt that you can build off of. So I came up with the idea of using tags, canons, and topics, and ultimately ended up using only tags so people wouldn&#39;t have to read a whole canon per day.
&gt; 
&gt; As for the prompts, it took quite a bit of research. I had to find tags that didn&#39;t have far too many entries, and that were relatively easy to get into without the reader having to go through previous lore. I tried organizing also special days: days ending in 5 all had to do with the 3 major SCP religions, days ending in 0 had mostly to do with past contest entries, I don&#39;t remember what was on the 21st night of September, etc. I also got a ton of help from [[[yossipossi-authorphage|Yossi]]], [http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/optimisticlucio Lucio], [[[Aismallard]]], and some others!

Well, your prompts served artists&#39; imaginations well. With such an art-centric project, what do you think is art&#39;s role on the wiki, and how do you feel SCiPTEMBER serves that role?

&gt; I feel like until recently, art has largely served as a means of discovering articles to read. I know I&#39;ve personally seen cool art of an article and then decided to read it based on that. I think it has the potential to be more, and I hope one day more artists are able to contribute their visions to the wiki itself.
&gt; 
&gt; As for SCiPTEMBER, it was also a challenge of discovery. It was meant to give new readers the tools to find articles they want to read, to introduce everyone to sides of the wiki they may not have seen before, and to maybe guide more seasoned readers to hidden gems they may have missed. It&#39;s a challenge to celebrate what we&#39;ve all built together.

Numerous people would agree, seemingly. What particularly stand-out artists from Sciptember would you like to shout-out?

&gt; First of all, I&#39;d like to give a shout-out to [https://twitter.com/idmns IDMNS] for not only completing all the prompts, but also making really cool art of every single one!
&gt; 
&gt; I would also like to shoutout [https://twitter.com/ScpLore @ScpLore] on twitter for completing the challenge!
&gt; And some other incredible people who made amazing creations: [[[olicus-art|Olicus]]], [[[niram-art|Niram]]], [[[eddybird-art-page-or-sth|Eddybird]]], [https://twitter.com/Rhineriver_ Rhineriver_], [https://twitter.com/Batvictor1 Batvictor], [https://twitter.com/taterings taterings], [[[duy-giang-s-artworks|Duy Giang]]], [[[artpage-fartpage|stephlynch]]], [https://twitter.com/psophode Psophode], [[[the-pastarasta1-art-page-experience-rise-of-the-revenge-of-r|pastarasta1]]], all the people on #SCiPTEMBER on [[[scpdeclassified|SCPD]]], and honestly everyone who participated! It really wouldn&#39;t have been the same without you guys, and from the bottom of my heart: thank you!
&gt; 
&gt; Such amazing work from these individuals, though some may say artists don&#39;t get their fair share of representation on the wiki. How do you feel the wiki treats artists, and to what extent should that treatment change?

&gt; It&#39;s a complicated relationship. The wiki is fundamentally a writing site, and I knew this coming in here. But at the same time I can&#39;t help but wish that there were more ways to contribute, a way for people like me, who just are not good at writing, could leave our mark and tell our stories. Standalone art pages have been a good step towards this, but I think the next step should be discovery and organization of art pages.
&gt; 
&gt; As it stands, there isn&#39;t much space on the wiki for art by virtue of the formality of the format. And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s something that can be changed. However, as tales and other forms of contribution become more respected, so too will art find it&#39;s place on the wiki.

Excellent responses, Aethris. Thank you for participating in the interview!

&gt; No problem! Thank you.

+ Editorial
[[/div]]

 The Site News team will no longer be releasing simply a monthly recap of news that occurred throughout the month. We will be transitioning to a rolling format where a page will be posted at the beginning of each month with the editorial, features of the previous month, and statistics of the previous month. As new events, announcements, press releases, stories, interviews, columns, and so forth take place, the editors will post onto this page for the community to see throughout the month rather than simply one large recap at the end of the month. Additionally, an announcement will be provided in the News section on the front page linking to the freshly posted content.

 To elaborate further on the procedure, whenever something newsworthy is complete, that Site News member will post it to the Site News Workbench and alert an editor. The editor will then review the content, approve it as is or provide feedback for changes, make any necessary minor changes, and then post it to the actual Site News page where the community can view it. Additionally, the editor may sit on the story for a while so that more than one column or story can be posted together and save space on the front page. The editor will then write a blurb for the front page and link the new content there.

 Additionally, the content we will be producing will be different than before. We will no longer simply be a monthly recap with just a few neat columns. This means that all of the content besides the features and the statistics of the previous month in the Site News will either be updates for events as they take place or they will be content that is not reliant on any particular timescale. Writing columns, round table discussions, interviews, news reports, press releases, spotlights and showcases, investigative stories, and any other interesting ideas we might come up with along the way are acceptable avenues for our team to take.

The Community Outreach team has been looking to revive itself and its various subteams with Site News included. It was necessary that we make a change, and for that change to be meaningful, we needed new members with new ideas to bring to the conversation. We hope to bring interesting and related content to the community. Thank you for reading our Site News.
