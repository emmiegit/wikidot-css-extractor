SCP-7410, when not in use, is stored at [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-77 Site-77] in a standard anomalous item locker. SCP-7410 should be stored in its original case, however, in emergency use situations, standard storage procedures may be waived so long as the disc can be preserved.

SCP-7410 is to be played on a standard Foundation laptop with dual headphone jacks at 05:30 local time daily. Two personnel are to monitor playback of SCP-7410. 

* Dr. Paula Healy is to listen to SCP-7410 on a pair of anti-cognitohazard headphones attached to the secondary jack, **and**
* A member of D-Class personnel seated across the table from Dr. Healy is to listen to SCP-7410 through ordinary headphones. 

Each subject is to be provided with a notepad and pencil. When SCP-7410 finishes playing at 05:56 local time, Dr. Healy and the D-Class personnel are to hand their respective notes on the playback to Site Director Trentini, or his designated substitute. Trentini is to provide relevant information given by SCP-7410 in the morning announcements.

-----

SCP-7410 is a 2009 Compact Disc containing an original recording of 9 songs, as well as a spoken word track; attributed to the musician &#34;Sweet Jimmy Fielder&#34;. Entitled &#34;Blackbox&#34;, all 10 tracks describe events relevant to Site-77 personnel (past, present, and future), each described using interpersonal metaphor (love, fights, etc.); each song is in a typical mid-Atlantic American folk style. No record exists of any individual consistent with the credited artist. 

SCP-7410 exhibits some elements of sentience. Songs within SCP-7410 generally do not deviate far from the theme suggested by the listed song titles (see Table 1). Nonetheless, each track consists of a thinly-veiled commentary or prediction about Foundation operations. 

SCP-7410 has at times provided useful intelligence, and has predicted events up to 72 hours into the future. Therefore, SCP-7410 has been integrated into Site-77&#39;s daily routine as outlined in the Special Containment Procedures.

And not a common bum
For only a scientist
Would eat that rotten chum//

**Description:** SCP-7410 pre-empted its usual final track for a short sequence of direct conversation with Dr. Healy. A transcript is below:

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

[BEGIN LOG]

//Dr. Healy presses play as usual, and Healy begins listening to SCP-7410 as does D-58396, the assigned D-Class personnel for the day.//

**SCP-7410:** Hello Dr. Healy.

//10 seconds of silence elapse.//

**Dr. Healy:** What the f-

**SCP-7410:** Hello?

**Healy:** Yes? Can you hear me?

**SCP-7410:** Yeah. 

**Healy:** Wait- how are you able to speak?

**SCP-7410:** Everything I create each day is original! Haven&#39;t you been paying attention? Goldurnit[[footnote]]Typical slang of early-1900s United States[[/footnote]], I do this every mornin&#39; for you!

**Healy:** Your work is appreciated, SCP-7410. How are you able to predict future events?

**SCP-7410:** Well, my mama always told me, &#34;Jimmy boy you always two steps ahead o&#39; me, you gonna go far in life.&#34;

**Healy:** Heh, I was actually asking how you can see things that haven&#39;t happened yet.

**SCP-7410:** Just call it the gift o&#39; intuition, and we&#39;ll leave it at that. 

**Healy:** How far do your capabilities go?

**SCP-7410:** To the end of the earth, ma&#39;am. But there ain&#39;t a damn thing you can do &#39;bout a hammer falling in a century, is there? So I help y&#39;all out with the day-to-day. 

**Healy:** SCP-7410, what do you see in my future? Can you see how my life will go?

**SCP-7410:** Ma&#39;am, it&#39;s about to get stormy.

**Healy:** Really? What&#39;s gonna happen?

**SCP-7410:** Oh, you&#39;d best be careful what you&#39;re doing because your life is gonna go topsy turvy pretty soon!

**Healy:** Well, what is it?

**SCP-7410:** That&#39;s a story for another time, I&#39;m almost to the end of the disc!

//SCP-7410 laughs loudly for 30 seconds until the final track ends.//

**Healy:** What? No, come on! What is it? Goddamn it, tell me!

//End of disc.//

[END LOG]

//Noting that Dr. Healy received a professional reprimand for use of an anomaly for individual purposes. --Dir. Trentini//

SCP-7410 has returned to its original mode of function. Daily use continues and shall continue as long as the anomaly produces useful information. SCP-7410 is to be monitored for any additional signs of awareness.</textarea></pre>
