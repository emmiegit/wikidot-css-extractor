**Designation:** SCP-6835

**Threat Level:** Theta

**Special Containment Procedures:** Tactical Operations Unit Earnshaw-4 (&#39;Foo Fighters&#39;) has been tasked with investigating all reported sightings of SCP-6835, and expunging any recollection of the event from all witnesses. By order of the D7 Council, there are to be no further attempts to capture, or otherwise impede SCP-6835.

**Report:** SCP-6835 is the //Black Wyvern//, a //Ferdinand//-class air frigate which vanished along with its crew during the closing stages of the War of Alarian Aggression. Periodically, SCP-6835 will appear above populated areas under Rupertian jurisdiction (hereafter referred to as a Manifestation Event) at an altitude of between 25000 and 30000 hands. SCP-6835 Manifestation Events are typically concurrent with the onset of sudden and intense thunderstorms; whether SCP-6835 itself is responsible for these meteorological phenomena remains uncertain. 

Within minutes of appearance, SCP-6835 will begin rapidly descending at speeds of up to 170 kh per hour, before vanishing within a distance of 150 hands above ground. In some cases, SCP-6835 will attempt to hail nearby vessels prior to its descension. Interpreting signals originating from SCP-6835 has proven impossible however, with all attempts thus far causing electrical outages, and occasionally fires, in radio equipment.

The earliest known SCP-6835 sighting is attributed to the HMA //Queen Amelia//, whose crew reported witnessing a WAA-era craft in the vicinity of Mount Kingspear. The //Amelia//&#39;s captain, one Julius Abadie, apparently recognizing SCP-6835, refused direct orders to track the vessel&#39;s movements, instead demanded his servicemen join him in uttering a short prayer. Foundation agents embedded in the RAF[[footnote]]Rupertian Air Force[[/footnote]]investigated the sighting, and subsequently expunged all witness&#39; memory of the incident.

To date, the Foundation has made three attempts to intercept SCP-6835. In all cases, the pursuing aircraft were downed after experiencing what is speculated to be catastrophic engine failure. While the wreckage of all three vessels have since been retrieved, no human remains could be identified.

**Additional:** The following account of SCP-6835 was published in the Imperial Enquirer by retired airman Lord Thaddeus T. Whitestone, 7th Earl of Eastchapel, documented for future research by the [[[SCP-6087 | Department of Mythology and Folkloristics]]]:

As any groundgawker[[footnote]]Aerial slang term; used to refer to individuals who are inexperienced with aeronautics and navigation.[[/footnote]] worth his rations knows, the dutiful airmen who service this great nation are a valiant, though superstitious folk, with their own curious customs, traditions and folklore. Stories are told of the somber sully-gullies, a supposed species of blue-feathered seabird whose male members are abandoned by their partners after mating, and become so distraught as to fly directly into aircraft propellers, to disastrous consequence. There is the legendary Cloud Nine, an idyllic after-life reserved solely for those airmen who have spent at least forty years at sky, where wind and rain are non-existent, and the Moon is always full and bright. Tempting as it may seem to dismiss such stories as mere guff and claptrap, on my reputation as a scholar and a gentleman, the following account is as veracious and indisputable as the skies above. 

In the waning days of the War of Alarian Aggression, the //Black Wyvern// was renowned as one of the finest frigates of her class. Under the watchful command of the shrewd and daring Captain Phileas Faustus (pictured), the //Wyvern// emerged nigh-unscathed from countless battles across the Northern Front. This run of fair fortune was not to last however, and whilst traversing the thick mists above West Arthuria, the //Wyvern// was beset by a roving band of Zandish mercenaries. While the fatalities were few, the frigate&#39;s engines took heavy damage, and with her hydrium reserves low, the chances of return to Rupertian airspace were slim to none. At one minute past midnight, as it appeared their situation could grow no bleaker, the //Wyvern//&#39;s crew were visited by none other than the Devil himself, come shambling forth from the howling abyss in search of fresh subjects.

The Prince of Dust assured Captain Faustus that he could see to the the //Wyvern//&#39;s safe voyage home, a service he was more than happy to provide, in exchange for the immortal essence of the first crewmember to set foot on land. The quick-witted captain hastily accepted this bargain, and no sooner than words passed his teeth, the //Wyvern// began moving of her own accord, sailing the celestial sea at speeds unfathomable. Within mere hours, the dirigible had reached the clear skies of the Motherland, only coming to an abrupt halt once the Lord of Shadows returned, eagerly awaiting his prize.

Refusing to condemn any of his men to the pustulous pits of the Weeping Wastes, Captain Faustus instead took the Devil by surprise, seizing the ship&#39;s cat by its tail, and sending it plummeting to the ground below. As the feline was technically considered a member of the //Wyvern//&#39;s crew, the Devil no longer held claim to the soul of any human occupants. However, while the Devil may on occasion be outwitted by mortal men, as any cleric will assure you, he rarely takes such instances in his stride. Thus it was that the wrathful Prince of Dust placed a curse upon the //Wyvern// and her crew, forcing the vessel to remain adrift until the end of time. In the years that have elapsed since, airmen from all corners of the Empire have reported sighting the phantom airship during their travels, always descending, but unable to land. All aviators are advised to keep safe distance from the //Black Wyvern// should she appear within their midst, and make no attempt to respond should she hail your vessel.

Pity not the //Wyvern//&#39;s crew, dear reader - rest assured, knowing that what dwells within her duralumin belly no longer holds any closer resemblance to godsfearing Rupertians than a common sea slug. Save all sympathies instead for those unfortunate enough to encounter the Horror of the Heights, and be drafted into the company of the damned.

You have been warned.
