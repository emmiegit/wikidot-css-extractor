**Item #:** SPC-172

**Object Class:** Apollyōken

**Selachian Pugilization Contingencies:** Due to its anomalous effect, SPC-172 is unpunchable. 

In lieu of the abandoned full-scale punching campaign of SPC-172, the **DARWIN CAN EAT MY ASS** protocol has been enacted to drive SPC-172 to extinction through non-pugnātorial means. Failure to eradicate SPC-172 poses a nonzero risk of SPC-172-A spreading as a dominant evolutionary trait among sharks in the long term, which would result in an End-of-World K/O Failure Scenario.

**Description:** SPC-172 is a selachian entity known to civilians as the narwhal[[footnote]] //(Monodon monoceros)// [[/footnote]]. While technically a mammal, SPC-172 meets the Shark Punching Center&#39;s [http://www.scp-wiki.net/spc-169-j three criteria for verifiable sharkitude]. 

Over time, male instances of SPC-172 have evolved a facial stabbing implement (heretofore SPC-172-A) that completely neutralizes all punching attempts.

++ Punchination Attempt Log-172:

||~ Punch Attempt ||~ Punch Result ||~ Notes ||
|| Agent Seagal uppercutting a captive instance of SPC-172. || False-positive || &#34;We&#39;ve been over this. It doesn&#39;t count unless it&#39;s //directly// in the shark&#39;s face.&#34; - Coach Naismith ||
|| Agent Seagal punching a captive instance of SPC-172 in the face. || Negative || Following surgery and successful recovery, Seagal has since requested transfer to another project that doesn&#39;t involve punching a pointed stick. ||
|| Agent Seagal punching a captive instance of SPC-172 in the face, harder. || Negative || &#34;Good Lord, it&#39;s like he&#39;s wearing his arm as a horn sock...&#34; - Coach Naismith ||
|| Deployment of a fist-tipped [http://www.scp-wiki.net/spc-169-j Ahab-2] unit modified for underwater deployment into an instance of SPC-172 || Inconclusive || An autopsy of the resulting cloud of shredded viscera was unable to return any evidence of successful facial fisticuffs. ||
|| Agent Seagal punching a captive instance of SPC-172 in the face even harder, with his other arm. || Negative || The fist came within 1.2 meters of the instance&#39;s face before Agent Seagal succumbed to lethal injuries consistent with fishkebabitization. ||
|| Agent Norris punching a captive female - ergo, hornless -  instance of SPC-172. || N/A || Punch was initially successful and resulted in death of the instance, but autopsy revealed that female instances of SPC-172 are toothless, which causes them to fail the third criterion of verifiable sharkitude, &#34;does it have pointy bits,&#34; and - ergo - are not sharks. ||
|| Agent Norris punching a juvenile male instance of SPC-172, with a smaller SPC-172-A instance than usual, in the face. || N/A || &#34;Come on, he&#39;s a //kid.//&#34; - Coach Naismith ||
|| Agent Norris punching a captive male instance of SPC-172 in the face, harder than Agent Seagal. || N/A || &#34;I quit.&#34; - Agent Norris. ||
|| Agent Norris punching a captive male instance of SPC-172 in the face, harder than Agent Seagal, or Coach Naismith will burn his house down. || Negative || The fist came within 1.1 meters of the instance&#39;s face before Agent Norris succumbed to lethal injuries consistent with fishkebabitization. ||
|| Sawing off a captive male instance of SPC-172&#39;s SPC-172-A, then punching it. || N/A || &#34;We&#39;re the Shark Punching Center, not the Shark Editing //Then// Shark Punching Center. Lose the goddamn training wheels.&#34; - Coach Naismith ||
|| Usage of experimental selachian-punching device **HERCULES HATES SHARKS** to partially decrease the mass of Agent Norris&#39;s rocket-propelled disembodied fist in such a manner that it phases through the SPC-172-A instance and lands on the captive male instance&#39;s face. || Inconclusive || Device failed, dimensional anomaly generated, accidentally punched God. ||</textarea></pre>
