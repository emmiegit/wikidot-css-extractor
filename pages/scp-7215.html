**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7215 is kept within the Site-115 break room. All Site-115 personnel must inform Site Director Steele before utilizing SCP-7215.

**Description:** SCP-7215 is a standard Gregorian monthly calendar with only one page, composed of glossy paper. At the end of every month, SCP-7215 will change its contents to display the new current month. This page will automatically update with notable events at Site-115, written in pen.[[footnote]] The handwriting of this writing has not been identified.[[/footnote]] 

When an individual makes a marking on SCP-7215, they will experience mild to severe flu symptoms on the marked day, despite no evidence of being infected with an influenza virus.[[footnote]] This has also been observed to work retroactively, creating the potential for paradoxes. [[/footnote]] These symptoms continue until the individual is excused from their place of work, whereupon the symptoms dissipate, leaving the subject healthy and unharmed.

**Addendum 7215.1:** Site Applications

Shortly after the SCP-7215 file went online, the number of illness-excused absences increased drastically at Site-115. To address the causes of these absences, Site Director Steele met with Junior Researcher Lennings to discuss the suspected use of SCP-7215.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
= **INTERVIEW**
------
**Interviewer:** Site Director Stacy Steele
**Interviewee:** Junior Researcher Liam Lennings
**Date:** April 6th, 2018
------
= **«BEGIN LOG»**

**Steele:** Lennings, I&#39;ve called you in here to talk about your excessive absences. You&#39;ve been sick on four separate occasions in the past two weeks.

**Lennings:** Lennings? What&#39;s with the professionalism? Did the promotion get to your head? //(Laughs)//

**Steele**: Thought I&#39;d may as well play the part. So, mind explaining the absences?

**Lennings:** I won&#39;t get in trouble for this, will I?

**Steele:** Please, you know I&#39;m not going to do that to you.

**Lennings:** Alright, I&#39;m holding you to that. We&#39;ve been using the calendar in the break room. We&#39;ve been using it to give ourselves time off since it&#39;s easier than going through the whole process.

**Steele:** And they think that if I know, I&#39;ll stop them?

**Lennings:** Pretty much. You&#39;ll let it slide, right?

**Steele:** I&#39;ll do you one better.

[[/div]]

Following this, Director Steele released a memo to members of Site-115, regarding SCP-7215.
[[div class=&#34;email&#34;]]
[[div class=&#34;tofrom&#34;]]
**To:** Site-115 ([# all.site115@scip.net])
**From:** Stacy Steele ([# stacy.steele@scip.net])
**Subject:** Increased Absences, SCP-7215
[[/div]]
------
I&#39;m aware of the usage of SCP-7215 to bypass the lengthy process of requesting days off. I&#39;ve only been the Director for about a month, so I know what it&#39;s like to have management breathing down your neck.

Some of you know me from when I was a Senior Researcher. I assure you, I&#39;m still the same person. I only ask that you tell me why you&#39;re using SCP-7215 and ask that you don&#39;t abuse the system.

I&#39;m here to help.

**Addendum 7215.3:** Unexpected Behavior

On May 1st, 2018, SCP-7215 updated to May, however, it didn&#39;t document any day after the second. Following this discovery, a rumor spread across Site-115, suggesting that the lack of calendar days on SCP-7215 implied a potential ZK-Class &#34;End of Time&#34; Scenario.

The following log was recorded on surveillance cameras within the Site-115 break room.
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

**Time:** 16:26, May 1st, 2018
**Camera:** Break Room - Interior
**Personnel Present:** Sr. Rsr Adams, Jr. Rsr Lennings, Jr. Rsr Parks, and Agent Martinez

= **«BEGIN LOG»**

//(All present personnel enter the break room, mid-conversation.)//

**Parks:** //(yelling)// We can&#39;t just give up! There has to be some anomaly on-site that can nullify this, or some kind of thaumaturgic ritual, or a- 

**Adams:** It&#39;s just an isolated event! There&#39;s no proof saying that //all of time// is going to end. The Foundation would&#39;ve found out by now. 

**Parks:** //(gestures to SCP-7215)// The calendar is __right there.__ What more proof could you need?! 

**Adams:** //(shakes head)// Even with that, there should still be other signs that something&#39;s happening tomorrow, but all the tests came back cold. Maybe this is some kind of mistake on the anomaly&#39;s part.

**Parks:** It hasn&#39;t been wrong before! This thing has predicted everything at the site so far. It got the containment breach, its managed meetings- Hell, it even predicted Liam&#39;s food poisoning! And it still happened!

**Lennings:** Worth it.

**Parks:** This is the end of //time!// Why are you so calm about this?

**Adams:** Because we&#39;ve spent the whole day looking for outs! What else can we do now?

//(All parties are silent. The air conditioning unit turns on, producing a light buzzing sound heard throughout the rest of the recording.)//

**Martinez:** Maybe it&#39;s a localized event. Maybe it&#39;ll only affect the site and nothing else.

**Lennings:** I don&#39;t think it works like that.

**Martinez:** But it&#39;d explain why you can&#39;t find anything wrong. It&#39;s a local event, not worldwide. So...

//(Martinez walks up to SCP-7215 and makes a marking.)//

**Martinez:** I&#39;m staying home.

//(Martinez exits the break room.)//

**Lennings:** And then there were three.

**Parks:** //(throws hands into the air)// Fine! I guess the next best thing to do is to evacuate the site.

**Lennings:** I&#39;ll let everyone know.

//(Lennings runs out of the break room.)//

**Adams:** We still don&#39;t know for sure!

**Parks:** Keep telling yourself that.

//(Adams sighs and looks around the break room. The water cooler gurgles in the corner.)//

**Adams:** So, are you coming in tomorrow?

//(Parks walks over to SCP-7215 and makes a marking. She then turns and shakes her head.)//

**Parks:** No.

//(Parks exits the room. Lennings enters shortly after.)//

**Lennings:** Forgot to schedule me being sick.

//(Lennings walks over to SCP-7215 and makes a marking. He then jogs out of the room.)//

**Lennings:** //(faintly)// See you later Alex!

//(Adams stands in the break room for two minutes. He walks over and inspects SCP-7215. After a few minutes, he makes a marking on SCP-7215. Adams then exits the room.)//

**Closing Notes:** Throughout the next thirty minutes, several personnel enter the break room and make a marking on SCP-7215. Conversation during this period is either a repetition of earlier remarks or is unrelated to SCP-7215 entirely.

[[/div]]
Director Steele, unaware of this development,[[footnote]] Director Steele had avoided all available forms of communication with Site-115 to enjoy a &#34;stress-free day.&#34;[[/footnote]] came in on May 2nd. She found a sticky note attached to SCP-7215 and, after reading its contents, alerted all Site-115 personnel to return to work immediately. SCP-7215 had updated to its predictable state, outlining the rest of the month without error.

A transcription of the sticky note has been logged below:
