Things aren&#39;t looking too well.
@@@@
Despite my advisor&#39;s best attempts, the Temple of Knowledge has denied my requests to access their Archives. Their reason? Simply put, the information I need is considered &#34;highly sensitive&#34; and perusing it requires direct permission from either the Chief Librarian or the Imperial Archmage.
@@@@
Fuck, I&#39;m exhausted.
@@@@
It&#39;s been weeks. Weeks of waiting, weeks of anxiety and dread. I know I should have anticipated all this, but with my thesis on the line, I was willing to cling onto any sliver of hope that I&#39;d get my way.

Now I might have to change my subject altogether.
@@@@
Jacques says I need not worry — there are plenty other sources for my research — but I just know this was my best shot at getting actual primary sources on [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/daevite-hub | Daevite]]] religious practices.

I gotta figure out just how I&#39;m gonna explain this to Jacques without looking like an idiot: I tried my luck in the Wanderers&#39; Library today, with no results. 
@@@@
It wasn&#39;t that they didn&#39;t have anything on the Daevites; failing to find info in the physical and metaphysical manifestation of info itself would have been humiliating. On the contrary, there were far too many sources: when the Librarians returned with my requested documentation, they almost entombed me in books, scrolls and clay tablets. Apparently, the Davites have existed in practically every universe with an iteration of Earth, and all the sources I had been provided reached far and wide across the Multiverse. 
@@@@
Guess I should have been more specific about which version I was interested in.
@@@@
Regardless, with my deadlines looming, I have no time for sorting infinite documentation about infinite versions of my subject of study, so I bailed before the Library could bury me beneath another motherload worth of books.

The following e-mail was received by Mr. Rodríguez following his return from the Wanderers&#39; Library. Through anomalous means, the origin address has been rendered both illegible and untraceable. 

&gt;  {{Dear Mr. Rodríguez,}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{You do not know who I am, and have, for the time being, no need to know. It suffices to say that I am a person deeply involved with the Temple of Knowledge and the Sacred Library of Idhai.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{It has been recently brought to my attention that you have been denied access to the Sacred Library&#39;s Archives. Though I have no doubt a capable researcher such as yourself should have no problem finding an alternative to the sources currently kept from you by the Temple of Knowledge, I know of no reason for your investigation to be made more complicated than necessary.}} 
&gt;
&gt; {{I understand the Temple&#39;s concern with information surrounding the Daevites. Their magical and anomalous practices were, after all, quite dangerous and brutal even by their time&#39;s standards, and the Empire fears that bringing them to public light might encourage the abuse of said knowledge.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{However, since you are merely interested in the religious aspects of late Daevite culture, and there is nothing to indicate that you mean to apply what insight you gain, I believe it is fair that I provide you with the materials you need to bring your work to fruition.}}
&gt; 
&gt; {{Should you accept my help, you will receive all the documents, primary sources and other paraphernalia that I currently have in my possession. All will be discreetly mailed to your dormitory on Deer College.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{For obvious reasons, I implore you not to disclose this conversation, or any further exchange we may have, to anyone. Providing you with the information I&#39;ve extracted from the Archives thanks to my credentials is not illegal, but it could bring unwanted attention to my persona and compromise my own projects.}}

Z&#39;s first package came in the mail today: a crate filled to the brim with yellowed papyruses in ancient Egyptian and a few clay tablets in Minoan. Seems like an attempt by priests of Ra and Minoan sorcerers to understand the religious beliefs of the then-expanding Daevite Empire.

If this is just the start, then Z really is living up to their promise! And to think I almost believed they might be a murderer!

Gods, I can&#39;t even think clearly! My project has finally got a breathing chance! Hell, a **breathing chance**? By the time I&#39;m done, I might finally have the guts and grit to apply to the Imperial Academy of Higher Arcana! Doctorate, here I come!

Last night, while I was reading one of the latest scrolls Z sent me, I got this massive headache that wouldn&#39;t go away. Campus doctor found nothing odd and gave me a few aspirins.

Z sent me pictures of a few Daevite artifacts currently in the Empire&#39;s possession. It isn&#39;t as exciting as examining them myself, but this will have to do. I find it incredible just how many of the culture&#39;s practices were inscribed not only in written record, but as pictorical depictions in their pottery and art.

Today I studied a stone tablet much older than any of the other sources I have consulted so far. If I understand correctly, it depicts a sacrifice to the eldritch deity known as the Scarlet King, whose figure is carved at the center of the tablet, surrounded by other idols and a group of dancing supplicants. This would confirm, along with the other rituals I&#39;ve encountered through my research, that our universe is one of the few iterations in the Multiverse where the cult of the Scarlet King was widespread through the Daevite Empire, and that Daeva matriarchs often served as high priestesses. 
@@@@
Now this is what I call a breakthrough. With this tablet, I can date the worship of some Daevite deities further back in time than is traditionally thought to have started! 
@@@@
I will ask Z to confirm where this tablet was excavated from. Perhaps they can provide me with more pieces like this one?

I&#39;m starting to get a bit curious about Z. Maybe a bit too curious. 
@@@@
Can&#39;t really be blamed, can I? After all, my mysterious benefactor has made themself... well... mysterious. What they&#39;ve let me glimpse of their persona, occupation and overall field of study tells me next to nothing. All I know is that, prior to getting involved with the Empire, they studied or otherwise held a position at the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/three-portlands-hub | International Center for the Study of Unified Thaumaturgy]]], and that they currently reside on Idhai.
@@@@
I can&#39;t take my mind off the blood on the tablet. Either someone cut themselves while packaging it, or it&#39;s been recently used. But for what? The tablet has no magical properties of its own; it&#39;s merely a record for a specific ceremony. 
@@@@
Unless...

Whatever the Empire is doing with artifacts like this behind closed doors, I sure don&#39;t want any part in it.

I met Z at a small café near the edge of Three Ports. --I must say I was expecting someone taller.--
@@@@
We sat down to talk, and they delivered the final batch of documents: a single, small package that nonetheless weighs quite a bit. They instructed me not to open it until I was back at campus, so I obliged. 
@@@@
Our chat was quite productive. Not only was I reassured of my potential for joining the Imperial Academy, but Z revealed a few more details about their person. They spent an entire year as an exchange student at [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/alexylva-university-hub | Alexylva University]]]; many of their current projects were directly influenced by their time there. They also said that I need not worry about returning the materials they had provided me with; someone would come pick them up with the same discretion with which they were delivered.
@@@@
As the evening began to dwindle into night, they took their leave, claiming they were headed for Eurtec next, off to pick up some materials from a contact at Prometheus Consolidated. We shook hands, and they asked to be kept informed about my thesis. I thanked them for everything and went on my way.
@@@@
I opened the package as soon as I got to my room, and was surprised to find a leatherbound volume titled &#34;[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-140 | A Chronicle of the Daevas]]].&#34; No author is listed, but a small note written by Z claims that this tome is a record of Daevite history, from the formation as a people to their fall at the hands of the Adytites.
@@@@
It&#39;s a bit odd that they&#39;ve given me this so late in my thesis&#39; development, but I&#39;m thankful nonetheless. Perhaps I can add a chapter on how the religious beliefs of the Daevites influenced their anomalous biowarfare techniques?

Again, why did Z think it better to give me this book last? I could have saved some time by just referring to this source rather than translating some of the other texts and artifacts they procured me. 
@@@@
But I can&#39;t be picky, can I? Z probably spent a lot of time and went through a lot of trouble to get me all this. Maybe they had more trouble getting this one out of the Archives?
@@@@
Best keep at it, hah. I honestly can&#39;t believe how fascinated I am by this book. It&#39;s so engrossing, so captivating. I almost didn&#39;t sleep last night and I&#39;ve only covered about a third of its length! I almost feel glued to it. Whomever was the chronicler for this book, they sure knew how to tell a story.

Done.
@@@@
I&#39;ve finished the book, and I feel like I now have all I need to deliver an impeccable thesis. It&#39;s a shame I can&#39;t directly thank Z for all their help, but I guess they&#39;d prefer I just stick to the plan and apply for the Academy next year, once my work here is over.
@@@@
This whole experience has left me a bit weary (and my headaches have returned in intervals), but it will all be worth it when my career takes off.
@@@@
It&#39;s strange, really. I almost wish there was even more to the history of the Daevites. Then I could probably become an authority on the subject.
@@@@
Maybe I should re-read the book?

I feel like I&#39;m being watched.
@@@@
The moment I stepped outside my dorm room this morning, I noticed something was off.
@@@@
A weird sensation at the back of my head kept me looking over my shoulder every time I heard (or thought to have heard) steps behind me. I didn&#39;t catch anyone looking at me, or following me, but the feeling has not gone away.
@@@@
Gods, this stress thing is really getting out of hand. After I turn in my thesis, I&#39;ll probably take a long overdue trip to California. Everyone can use a little sunlight every now and then.

Sun and relaxation...

The materials, the texts, the tablets...

I left for about half an hour for breakfast, and when I returned, everything Z sent me had vanished. All except the book. 
@@@@
There&#39;s no evidence of a break-in. No locks picked, no black-suited spooks skulking around, nothing. 
@@@@
Gotta assume this is Z&#39;s doing. After all, why would they take it all and leave only &#34;A Chronicle of the Daevas&#34;? 
@@@@
Yeah, no doubt this is --his-- their doing. I mean, who else could it be? UIU? Empire? Foundation?

Fuck, Z. You could have at least left a note.

Talked to Jacques today; they seemed to notice my unease, but I can&#39;t really tell them what&#39;s been happening without revealing my dealings with Z, can I?
@@@@
Speaking of Z, I tried thanking them for picking up the materials, but I haven&#39;t really been able to reach them. They usually respond to my e-mails within a day of it being sent, but I figure they&#39;re busy with their travelling and all. 
@@@@
Damn.

I gotta stay calm. Can&#39;t have Jacques worrying too much. No questions asked is the best way to go around this, I think.

I had a strange [[[https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/umbral | dream]]].
@@@@
In it, I stood at the edge of a black forest, a thick fog smothering everything in sight. Over my head, a strange aster reigned alone, sickly and green. Voices came from somewhere beyond the woods, laughing and beckoning, but they were quickly drowned by the sound of an incoming train.  
@@@@
As I tried heading towards the source of the commotion, I felt myself beginning to wake up, but not before I caught a figure watching me, shrouded in darkness and mist.  
@@@@
It looked like Z.

I decided to make a short visit to the Wanderers&#39; Library. There was not much to do on campus anyways; maybe, I thought, this would help clear my mind.
@@@@
I was wrong.
@@@@
As I walked among the shelves, past the patrons who prowled in search of knowledge, I felt them: eyes fixed on me, following my every step, peering, judging. Up from the Rafters, in the corner of my eye, behind every bookshelf and archway, they looked on.
@@@@
It didn&#39;t matter how deep I ventured into the stacks, how far away from the Main Hall my feet took me. I felt like every being, every creature, every thing on the Library stared at me. Several times I turned to face them, only to find them averting their sight, but as I again went on my way, the sensation returned, stronger than before.
@@@@
I can&#39;t go back. Not now.
@@@@
It is as if the Library has become one great eye, unblinking.

&gt; {{By this time, I hope that your thesis is complete, and that you have gained all the insight on ancient Daevite culture that you wished for.}}
&gt;
&gt; {{I apologize for not having answered you before. My task has kept me far more occupied than I had foreseen. I do trust, however, that all materials sans &#34;A Chronicle of the Daevas&#34; have been taken from you in a discreet fashion. I will similarly send for said text, if you have no objections; despite being just a copy of the original, it too must be returned to the Sacred Library&#39;s Archives.}}

&gt; {{I will be returning to Deer College soon, and we may again reunite to discuss what developments have transpired. Some great news I have for you. Great news indeed.}}

{{The corpse of Adrián Rodríguez was found in the Theurgy Department, following complaints of an upsetting, sulfur-like smell emanating from within the building. The body, which forensics determined had expired a few hours prior to being found, was covered in numerous incisions which appeared to be ritualistic in nature. Cause of death was inconclusive, given that Rodríguez had not bled out nor suffered any major injuries.}}  

{{The bodies of Jacques Horowitz, Allan Jameson, Patrick Blaise, Miriam Núñez, Danielle Vega and Theodore Elam were arranged along the circumference of what specialists described as a Daevite sigil employed for human sacrifice. All victims had their eyes, ears, tongues and lips removed, said body parts piled up on a crude altar fashioned at the center of the sigil. Despite these mutilations, forensics determined that the cause of death was exsanguination: the victims&#39; throats and wrists were slit open, their blood likewise unnaturally pooled at the center of the ritual circle.}}

{{Given the strange circumstances of the crime and of Rodríguez&#39;s demise, it is currently believed that he was not in control of his actions, nor did he act alone. The individual known as &#34;Z&#34; is currently a suspect because of the materials he provided to Rodríguez and his presumed intent of returning to Deer College to meet with the now-deceased student. The UIU&#39;s Department of Paranalytics is also currently petitioning the Temple of Knowledge to grant them access to the list of persons who consulted or took literature pertaining to Daevite culture from the Sacred Library&#39;s Archives. Given the anomalous and often cognitohazardous nature of this civilization&#39;s artifacts and documents, it is now believed that Z deliberately instigated Rodríguez&#39;s paranoid and violent behavior, culminating in the events of 19/12/29.}}
