**Special Containment Procedures:**[[footnote]] Item effects the primary directive of the Foundation and the Overseer Council. [[/footnote]] SCP-7640 currently remains uncontained. The discovery of an instance of SCP-7640 should be promptly reported to Mobile Task Force Alpha-1. (&#34;Red Right Hand&#34;) Upon confirmation of its manifestation, the impacted wall is to be expeditiously demolished and replaced.

O5 Council members who observe SCP-7640 are to undergo amnestic treatment and be reintegrated into society. Anomalous O5 Council members must be terminated without exception.

**Description:** SCP-7640 designates a series of windows that spontaneously materialize within the living quarters assigned to O5 Council personnel. Any O5 Council member that peers through SCP-7640 immediately undergoes a cognitohazardous effect, causing their immediate resignation. Inhabitants of the same room as SCP-7640 universally display a heightened curiosity towards it; however, it remains undetermined whether this response is anomalous. Those who peer through SCP-7640 provide disparate accounts of the visual contents on the opposing side. Presented below are selected examples of reported observations.


|| O5 Council Member || Observations || Anomalous Effects ||
|| O5-7, &#34;The Fool&#34; || A small farm. O5-7 reports the sound of cattle and the laughter of a baby. || O5-7 reported feelings of melancholy. Amnesticized. ||
|| O5-11, &#34;The Emperor&#34; || Several children bullying another child. The point of view then comforted the child, hugging him. || O5-11 reported a strong feeling of regret. Terminated. ||
|| O5-2, &#34;The Lovers&#34; || A large pod of dolphins underwater. They appear to be playing. || O5-2 reported feeling content before being removed from the room. Terminated. ||
|| O5-13, &#34;The Null&#34; || A therapist&#39;s office. Sounds of sobbing and comfort are audible. || O5-13 refused to elaborate on his emotions and began crying. Amnesticized. ||
|| O5-5, &#34;The Mother&#34; || A small bed in a hospital with a weak, elderly man laying in it. The viewer proceeded to feed him. || O5-5 refused to leave her living quarters. Mobile Task Force involvement was necessary. Terminated in combat. ||
|| O5-9, &#34;The Star&#34; || See below. ||

In order to better understand SCP-7640, and the effects it has on O5 Council members, the Foundation dispatched Doctor Tiana Mark Rosanne to conduct a series of interviews. These interviews aimed to acquire additional details about the effects of SCP-7640. The following log contains a transcription of the last interview conducted between O5-9 and Dr. Rosanne.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Interviewed:** O5-9

**Interviewer:** Dr. Rosanne

**Foreword:** This interview was conducted shortly after O5-9 viewed SCP-7640 and shortly before he was terminated.[[footnote]]Dr. Rosanne was not made aware of the termination before the interview as to maintain a lack of bias.[[/footnote]]

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**//O5-9 walks into the room and sits in an office chair. He appears upset.//**

**O5-9:** Well, I wasn&#39;t expecting someone like you to be, uh... you know. Aren&#39;t you worried those shoes of yours will carry the stain?

**Dr. Rosanne:** I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t understand what you mean. What stain?

**O5-9:** Oh, you&#39;re the interviewer. Forget I said anything, classified Council business.

**Dr. Rosanne:** I&#39;ll try to ignore that. Are you O5-9?

**O5-9:** I would say something along the lines of &#34;the one and only&#34; but I&#39;ve read the file, you&#39;ve read the file, so we both know I am definitely not.

**Dr. Rosanne:** Am I missing something? What did you see in 7640?

**O5-9:** Would it matter? Would telling you stop anything? All of this will end up in a report that will be handed to the committee, and nobody will do anything.

**Dr. Rosanne:** Even if you don&#39;t think your statement will do anything to stop the anomaly, it&#39;s your duty to say something.

**//O5-9 stands up and begins pacing around the room.//**

**O5-9:** &#34;Duty&#34; my ass. Have you noticed any connections yet? You&#39;re an interviewer, and you&#39;ve talked to us all. Review your notes that you&#39;ve been scratching in that little book this whole time.

**Dr. Rosanne:** It&#39;s not my job to make connections. I&#39;m not a researcher, so-

**O5-9:** But you care, don&#39;t you? Look at the notes, and tell me what you think.

**//Dr. Rosanne looks down at her notepad.//**

**Dr. Rosanne:** Well, -13 saw a therapist office, -2 saw dolphins, and -5 saw a hospital. I don&#39;t see any similarities.

**O5-9:** Shit. Of //course// you don&#39;t, you don&#39;t know- didn&#39;t know them. -13? He had a degree in psychology. -2? Marine biology. -5? She was a nurse before coming here. You really want to know what I saw? Myself, sitting on a back porch, looking over a nicely trimmed lawn. My wife[[footnote]]O5-9&#39;s wife and children were amnesticized upon his employment to the Foundation.[[/footnote]] beside me. Both of us were enjoying the... the crisp morning air before the kids woke up. It was exactly what I had before this place took it all away!

**Dr. Rosanne:** I- I&#39;m so sorry about that. Um, I don&#39;t know what to say.

**O5-9:** There&#39;s nothing you can say. You want my opinions on 7640? It... never mind, cut it, this interview is over.

**Dr. Rosanne:** But you can&#39;t-

**//O5-9 storms out of the room, shortly before being terminated.//**

**Description:** SCP-7640 designates a series of windows that spontaneously materialize within the living quarters assigned to O5 Council personnel. Any O5 Council member that peers through SCP-7640 views an alternate world where an alternate version of themself performs activities that they enjoyed before becoming a member of the O5 Council. In 100% of cases where an instance of SCP-7640 is viewed, the O5 Council member attempts to resign. It is currently unknown if this is part of its anomalous effect, or a natural response to viewing such imagery.

Additionally, amnestication has proven ineffective in suppressing memories of SCP-7640.[[footnote]] The current reason why is unknown, this is either due to the Mnestics being regularly prescribed to the O5 Council or some other effect. [[/footnote]]
