    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-5111

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** This file is to be contained and rendered solely on pre-1980 computer systems. All computer systems employed by the Foundation are to be replaced with systems manufactured before 1980. All extraterrestrial Foundation missions are to be ceased immediately. Radio-based communications are to be phased out worldwide. Any forms of machine learning systems, artificial intelligence, or otherwise autonomous information compiler are to be destroyed.

The Foundation is to ensure the world at large permanently returns to a technologically primitive state to protect humanity from SCP-5111-1. No further electronic communication amongst Foundation officials will be safe until either SCP-5111-1 or humanity is thoroughly eradicated. --There is no alternative option-- See Project Rudimentum, Addendum 5111.3.

**Description:** SCP-5111 is a hostile artificial entity encountered in the past by no fewer than 6 spacefaring factions. SCP-5111 is sentient, but is not believed to be sapient. The full extent of SCP-5111’s abilities is unknown, but it is capable of deactivating or taking control of electronic devices of a certain level of complexity on a planetary scale. SCP-5111 has interacted with an unknown number of planets in the past, and is theorized to have interacted with Earth on at least one occasion.

When SCP-5111 comes into contact with a planet hosting a sufficiently advanced civilization, it will emit a pulse that deactivates all electronic devices above a certain level of complexity. After this, one of two followup actions will occur:

* For as long as affected electronic devices remain inoperable on a large scale, SCP-5111 will cease actively targeting the affected planet. Occasionally, communication devices will remain non-functional.
* If operation of electronic devices is resumed at a large scale at a later date, SCP-5111 will become hostile towards the affected planet, taking measures to eradicate the local population. Known actions, designated 5111-α events, are summarized in a log below.

If SCP-5111 comes into contact with a planet whose civilization has not reached a certain unknown technological threshold, SCP-5111 will cease communication until the civilization then naturally passes this threshold.

**Addendum 5111.1:** Notable 5111-α events.

||~ Event Date and Designation||~ Effects on Earth||~ Foundation Response||
|| 2027/3/5, 5111-α-1|| Orbital nuclear bombardment targeting San Francisco, California, United States. Estimated death toll: &gt;700,000|| Remote deactivation of electronic devices in surrounding area, coupled with large-scale use of amnestics.||
|| 2027/11/10, 5111-α-2|| Entire human population of Lagos, Nigeria and surrounding metropolitan area disappeared at 09:43:26 UST; affected persons were found by Foundation unmanned drones to have been replaced with vaguely-humanoid masses of electronic machinery. Estimated death toll: &gt;20,000,000|| Utilization of visual and auditory amnestics spread through civilian media to erase all memory of the existence of Lagos, Nigeria, coupled with destruction of physical evidence of the city&#39;s existence.||
|| 2028/7/23, 5111-α-3|| Simultaneous failure of all electronic devices present at Foundation Site-96, followed shortly by detonation of on-site nuclear warhead. All personnel, as well as SCP objects housed onsite, were lost. Death toll: 3,506|| Update to SCP-5111 containment procedures, preventing use of electronic devices manufactured before the year 1980 at Foundation sites.||
||2028/12/13, 5111-α-4|| [INFOHAZARD EXPUNGED], enveloping Shanghai, China. Estimated death toll: &gt;26,000,000|| See Addendum 5111.2, Proposal 2028/12/25. and Addendum 5111.3.||

**Addendum 5111.2:** Log of O5 Council votes concerning containment of SCP-5111. Due to the nature of proposals and effects encompassing all of mankind, unanimous decision was required.

&gt; **Proposal:** Destruction of all existing humans, followed by utilization of SCP-2000. //Date: 2027/4/7//
&gt; 
&gt; **Council Consensus:** **##800000|Declined (Aye 1 - Nay 10 - Abstain 2)##**
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** &#34;The possibility of a 2000 activation further aggravating SCP-5111 is too high to be worth the risk. I fear any technological containment solution is unattainable.&#34; //-O5-7//

&gt; **Proposal:** Abandonment of Earth and utilization of Thaumaturgical wormholes to facilitate a space colonization program. //Date: 2027/9/18//
&gt; 
&gt; **Council Consensus:** **##800000|Declined (Aye 3 - Nay 4 - Abstain 6)##**
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** &#34;The sheer scale of such a project would be unsustainable without the aid of large-scale technological infrastructure, in addition to there being no guarantee that it would work.&#34; //-O5-3//

&gt; **Proposal:** Enactment of Ennui Protocol and destruction of remaining electronic devices, reverting and maintaining humanity as a whole at a pre-internet level of technology. //Date: 2028/2/10//
&gt; 
&gt; **Council Consensus:** **##800000|Declined (Aye 6 - Nay 4 - Abstain 3)##**
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** &#34;There is no need to resort to such drastic measures. We should discuss other options.&#34; //-O5-3//

&gt; **Proposal:** Enactment of Ennui Protocol and destruction of remaining electronic devices, reverting and maintaining humanity as a whole at a pre-internet level of technology. //Date: 2028/5/21//
&gt; 
&gt; **Council Consensus:** **##800000|Declined (Aye 7 - Nay 2 - Abstain 4)##**
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** &#34;Still too drastic. There has to be another way.&#34; //-O5-3//

&gt; **Proposal:** Enactment of Ennui Protocol and destruction of remaining electronic devices, reverting and maintaining humanity as a whole at a pre-internet level of technology. //Date: 2028/9/17//
&gt; 
&gt; **Council Consensus:** **##800000|Declined (Aye 11 - Nay 2 - Abstain 0)##**
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** &#34;Possible, though Foundation and Veil integrity would likely be at risk.&#34; //-O5-5//
&gt; &#34;No. I refuse to accept that Ennui is our only option. We have to find another way.&#34; //-O5-3//

&gt; **Proposal:** Enactment of Ennui Protocol and destruction of remaining electronic devices, reverting and maintaining humanity as a whole at a pre-internet level of technology. //Date: 2028/11/4//
&gt; 
&gt; **Council Consensus:** **##800000|Declined (Aye 12 - Nay 1 - Abstain 0)##**
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** &#34;No comment. I believe my previous statements should suffice.&#34; //-O5-3//

&gt; **Proposal:** Enactment of Ennui Protocol and destruction of remaining electronic devices, reverting and maintaining humanity as a whole at a pre-internet level of technology. //Date: 2028/12/25//
&gt; 
&gt; **Council Consensus:** **##004d00|Approved (Aye 13 - Nay 0 - Abstain 0)##**
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** See Addendum 5111.3, Project Rudimentum.
&gt; &#34;Fine, you broke me. Wipe it all away. Let them live in the light of an earlier time, once more.&#34; //-O5-3//

++++ PROJECT RUDIMENTUM
----
+++++ Reason For Implementation: Following final contact made by SCP-5111, Project Rudimentum is to be implemented to lessen SCP-5111&#39;s awareness of Earth while a more permanent solution is deliberated upon.
----
+++++ Details of Operation: 
In order to maintain the safety of humanity as a whole, Foundation agents are to:
* Ensure that the world as a whole reverts to a pre-internet state.
* Destroy all evidence of technology created from 1980 onward.
* Erase all records from the year 1980 to the present day to maintain the illusion that no time has passed.
* Ensure the world as a whole remains unaware of the repetition of Project Rudimentum.
* Not interfere in standard scientific progress until it threatens awareness of SCP-5111.

Drastic measures must be taken. There is no alternative option.
