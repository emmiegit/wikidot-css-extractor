Get To Know Me!
[[/div]]


[[table]]
[[row]]
[[cell style=&#34;width: 50%; margin:auto; padding-right: 5px;&#34;]]
I&#39;m looking for a good and loving home in the Three Portlands-Boring area. I get along well with most people, but I&#39;m some sort of magnet for meanness in other critters. As you might imagine, this means I&#39;m pretty shy and wouldn&#39;t mesh well with other pets. I also won&#39;t run away because I&#39;m scared of being attacked by wild critters so you can rest assured I will remain within your home!

As you can see, I&#39;m a raccoon! I&#39;m missing the fifth finger on my left paw for some reason, but I&#39;m still pretty handy.  I won&#39;t lie, I&#39;m a bit too clever for my own good, so I&#39;m going to need some rather attentive foster parents. By the way, I come with a specialized kennel that my crafty little hands can&#39;t pick open for when you need to transport me. Neat! 
[[/cell]]
[[cell style=&#34;width: 50%; margin:auto; padding-left: 10px;&#34;]]
I&#39;m a normal lil&#39; raccoon most of the time, and that means I&#39;m super curious and have an intense need to get my hands on anything I can. I have a weird interest in stuff like phones, laptops, and other such things, and I&#39;ve also figured out how to open doors, cans, and bags.

The folks at Wilson&#39;s highly suggest some advanced baby and/or dog proof doors with latches so I don&#39;t get into stuff I shouldn&#39;t be sticking my nose into. Though I&#39;m pretty sweet most of the time, please remember I&#39;m still an animal. I might bite you if I get scared, but don&#39;t worry, I don&#39;t have rabies! You might, however, want to get checked for tetanus!

Notes From My Foster Parents!
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;wilson-body&#34;]]
&gt; //Ever since I was a kid I&#39;ve always wanted to keep a raccoon as a pet since my uncle Jared had one, and when I saw little Bandit up for Foster I jumped at the opportunity. He looked a little different when I picked him up, but it&#39;s probably because of the lighting or something. I don&#39;t really know what I was expecting when I was told he was mischevious, I mean, I expected him to be on the same level as a very small child, but Bandit really was something else.//
&gt; 
&gt; //He wasn&#39;t really affectionate, which I can understand and truthfully expected, but he almost recoiled at touch whenever I tried to just scratch his ears. I couldn&#39;t leave him alone in the house because whenever I did, I&#39;d come back to find my phone off the hanger and Bandit screeching into it. I reckon he was taught some form of trick or something, &#39;cause he always seemed to call the same woman. Poor gal seems really distressed about it.//
&gt; 
&gt; ~Lupita La Hoz

&gt; //Bandit is 100% a cutie, but he really was a handful. I&#39;ve handled cockatrices who&#39;ve given me less grief than he did!//
&gt; 
&gt; //Don&#39;t let the adoption poster fool you, he refused to eat the cat food I set out for him and would instead break into my pantry and steal cans of Spaghetti-O&#39;s! As if that weren&#39;t bad enough, he somehow knew how to use a can opener and I&#39;d often come home from campus to find him, his fur, and the whole floor covered in marinara. I would have loved to keep him, but I can&#39;t afford tuition, pet costs, and his high upkeep.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Also, I think they must have two different raccoons at the adoption center, the one I fostered looked a little different than the one in the picture.// 
&gt; 
&gt; ~Helga Kavinsky

&gt; //This poor little sweetheart cost us a pretty penny through no fault of its own. It stole my kid&#39;s markers and wrote &#39;HELP I AM A MAN&#39; on the wall and made us think poor little Bandit was possessed, but that wasn&#39;t the case. I was reassured by the folks at Wilson&#39;s that no one there taught Bandit the trick, and it&#39;s entirely possible whoever owned him previously might have.// 
&gt; 
&gt; //If for whatever reason you&#39;re reading this, not cool dude. My husband and I paid for a full-house exorcism for no reason and now I can&#39;t see my mother anymore.//

Anders,

I&#39;ve had several complaints that the image we&#39;re using on the adoption poster is very clearly not Bandit. What&#39;s going on with that? Could you send a picture of what he actually looks like please?

It&#39;s hard enough finding these guys homes and the last thing we need here is people saying they didn&#39;t get what was advertised.

Thanks in advance!

Hi Miss Elliot,

I see your point.

Since poor Bandit looks a little worse for wear and is so sheepish, I figured a random picture of a raccoon would work, but you&#39;re right. Dishonesty is wrong, and I shouldn&#39;t have done this in the first place. I hope this new image doesn&#39;t hurt his chances. Here you go, and sorry for any trouble I caused!
