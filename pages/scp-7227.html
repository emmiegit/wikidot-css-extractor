**Item #:** SCP-7227

**Object Class:** Thorleyan

**Secure Containment Procedures:** Neither Alex Thorley is to be informed that they are the Other Alex Thorley. If the Other Alex Thorley learns that they are the Other Alex Thorley, Alex Thorley is to be convinced that they, too, are the Other Alex Thorley.

**Description:** The Other Alex Thorley is identical to Alex Thorley in all aspects. The Other Alex Thorley either works at the Department of Unreality or the Department of Other. The Other Alex Thorley, like Alex Thorley, believes they are Alex Thorley. Aside from Alex Thorley and the Other Alex Thorley, there are no other Alex Thorleys.

**Addendum-1:** Alex Thorleys&#39; interactions with the Department of Other.

**Thorley:** Sure.

//&lt;James withdraws SCP-477-J from their backpack. It is shiny and golden and super cool.&gt;//

//&lt;Thorley looks at SCP-477-J.&gt;//

**Thorley:** Is that an Army of Monsters card?

**James:** It is, it is! Do you play?

**Thorley:** I did, once. Actually...

//&lt;Thorley reaches into their bag and withdraws a holofoil golden bliss blight.&gt;//

**James:** A GOLDEN BLISS BLIGHT!?!?!???!??!

//&lt;Thorley nods and extends the card towards James.&gt;//

**Thorley:** Think you can take care of him for me?

//&lt;James looks at the card, then at Thorley, then at the card.&gt;//

**James:** You— you&#39;re giving it to me?

//&lt;Thorley sets the card in his hand and smiles.&gt;//

**Thorley:** Only if you promise to protect him.

**James:** I do! I do!

**Thorley:** Then, he&#39;s yours.

//&lt;James runs off, laughing excitedly with his golden necromancer in one hand and his new golden bliss blight in the other.&gt;//

//&lt;Thorley smiles politely.&gt;//

**Thorley:** It sure seems like it, though I think you might have me confused with someone else.

//&lt;James frowns, seemingly confused.&gt;//

**James:** Really? But they looked just like you...

//&lt;After a few minutes, Alex Thorley can be seen approaching the table with a [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/unreality-orientation bagel] in hand.&gt;//

**Thorley:** Mind if I sit?

**Trintavon:** Go ahead.

//&lt;Trintavon continues to work away on their laptop as Thorley silently eats their bagel. A few minutes pass before Thorley speaks again.&gt;//

**Thorley:** You ever feel like you&#39;re going crazy?

**Trintavon:** Sometimes, why?

//&lt;Trintavon is met with silence. He looks up from his laptop and notices that he is alone once more. He shakes his head and resumes his work.&gt;//

//&lt;After a few minutes, Alex Thorley can be seen approaching the table with a [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/burger burger] in hand.&gt;//

**Thorley:** Mind if I sit?

**Trintavon:** Go ahead.

//&lt;Trintavon continues to work away on their laptop as Thorley silently eats their burger. Only half a minute passes before Trintavon suddenly speaks.&gt;//

**Trintavon:** Didn&#39;t you already ask to sit?

**Thorley:** What? No.

**Trintavon:** I could have sworn--

**Thorley:** This again? 

**Trintavon:** Excuse me?

**Thorley:** What&#39;s with everyone acting like there are two of me? I could stand it when all of you kept pretending I didn&#39;t exist, but this? It&#39;s getting on my nerves.

**Trintavon:** ...right. My apologies.

//&lt;Trintavon resumes his work quietly while Thorley continues to eat their burger. A few minutes pass before Thorley speaks again.&gt;//

**Thorley:** You ever feel like you&#39;re going crazy?

//&lt;Trintavon laughs.&gt;//

**Trintavon:** More and more, as of late. You?

**Thorley:** All of the time. All of the fucking time.

//&lt;The pair stare at each other for a few moments. Finally, Trintavon sighs and returns to his work. Thorley takes a minute to finish their burger before standing to leave.&gt;//

**Trintavon:** It&#39;s not impossible, you know.

**Thorley:** Pardon?

**Trintavon:** That there are two of you. Just something to consider.

//&lt;Alex Thorley stares at him for a few moments before leaving.&gt;//
