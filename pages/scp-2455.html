**Item #:** SCP-2455

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2455 is contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, monitored at all times by a camera connected to an image analysis program. Should an instance of SCP-2455-1 be detected, Site Security is to be notified immediately, and the following procedures enacted as necessary:
* If the SCP-2455-1 instance is identified as a member of Foundation personnel and classified information is discussed in the presence of SCP-2455, SCP-2455 is to be administered a low-grade amnestic after the manifestation ceases. Internal Affairs is to be notified.
* If the SCP-2455-1 instance exhibits behavior analogous to being under the effects of another SCP object, a containment team is to be dispatched to 2455&#39;s cell, and the corresponding object secured to preemptively prevent contact from occurring. 

**Description:** SCP-2455 is a Caucasian woman of 21 years of age, capable of generating anomalous projections, designated SCP-2455-1. SCP-2455 possesses no anomalous properties outside of a SCP-2455-1 manifestation event, and is noted by staff as indecisive to the point of apathy towards its own containment.

Instances of SCP-2455-1 will manifest in the nearest space available. These entities appear identical to SCP-2455, with one visible factor altered, most commonly clothing. Generally SCP-2455-1 instances will be observed wearing a uniform corresponding to an organization SCP-2455 is not currently affiliated with. SCP-2455-1 instances have been confirmed to possess knowledge comparable, if not an exact match, to that of SCP-2455&#39;s, in addition to expected information regarding their apparent affiliation. [[footnote]]For example, a SCP-2455-1 instance in a baker&#39;s uniform will possess knowledge attributed to a professional baker.[[/footnote]] 

SCP-2455 claims that SCP-2455-1 manifests when it is faced with a &#39;major decision&#39;. See test logs attached below for analysis on this claim. SCP-2455-1 instances appear with the sole intention of insuring SCP-2455 &#39;picks their future&#39;. SCP-2455 claims the first appearance of SCP-2455-1 occurred shortly before its graduation from ████████ University, as SCP-2455 was attempting to choose which business to apply for employment with. Two instances of SCP-2455-1 manifested, one &#39;representing&#39; the █████ Corporation, and the other the ██████ store, a local business. Both instances possessed knowledge of the working conditions of both positions,[[footnote]]This knowledge has been verified as accurate[[/footnote]] and attempted to convince SCP-2455 to &#39;pick them&#39;.

__**Test 001 - 04/██/20██**__
&gt; **Procedure:** Subject is offered a different colored uniform.
&gt; **Results:** No SCP-2455-1 manifestation.
&gt; **Analysis:** Trivial decisions do not appear to trigger SCP-2455&#39;s effects.

__**Test 002 - 04/██/20██**__
&gt; **Procedure:** Subject is asked if it wished to be moved to a different site.
&gt; **Results:** No SCP-2455-1 manifestation.
&gt; **Analysis:** From SCP-2455&#39;s point of view, the two situations were identical.

__**Test 003 - 04/██/20██**__
&gt; **Procedure:** Subject is offered employment with the Foundation.
&gt; **Results:** No SCP-2455-1 manifestation.
&gt; **Analysis:** Subject was visibly conflicted by this decision, however no manifestation event occurred.

//I wonder if SCP-2455&#39;s effects could tell that we were not genuine with our offer?// - Dr Vauge.

__**Test 034 - 06/██/20██**__
&gt; **Procedure:** Unplanned test. As no test conducted so far had resulted in a manifestation event, the research staff were considering doing final tests and declaring SCP-2455 non-anomalous.
&gt; **Results:** SCP-2455-1 manifested wearing casual street clothes. Upon manifestation, SCP-2455-1 attempted to hide from research staff. When discovered, SCP-2455-1 vanished immediately.
&gt; **Analysis:** In the time period between SCP-2455-1 manifesting and its discovery, there was a real chance that SCP-2455 would be administered amnestics and released back into society. This indicates three things: first, that it does not have to be SCP-2455&#39;s decision that affects its future, that there has to be a real chance of that future occurring, and that SCP-2455-1 manifestations are not necessarily conductive to that future.


__**Test 036 - 07/██/20██**__
&gt; **Procedure:** Dr ████ (currently under watch from Internal Affairs for known sympathies to humanoid anomalies) was asked to interview SCP-2455.
&gt; **Results:** SCP-2455-1 manifested wearing the uniform of a junior researcher, and attempts to convince Dr ████ to employ SCP-2455, citing the precedents of [REDACTED]. SCP-2455-1 ignored SCP-2455.
&gt; **Analysis:** This manifestation was aware of classified information, notably the anomalous natures of [REDACTED]. Further questioning revealed that SCP-2455-1 was in possession of knowledge which would be expected of a Foundation employee with level 2 clearance.

__**Test 041 - 31/██/20██**__
&gt; **Procedure:** Unplanned test. SCP-2455 was being moved to another facility.
&gt; **Results:** SCP-2455-1 manifested wearing the same clothing as SCP-2455, however was infected with SCP-███
&gt; **Analysis:** The infected manifestation attempted to attack SCP-2455 to infect it with SCP-███. The escorting guards were able to neutralize the instance as they would a normal SCP-███ victim. Shortly afterwards, a containment breach occurred at Site-██, during which samples of SCP-███ were released. Possibility of using SCP-2455 as an &#39;early warning&#39; system is deemed worthy of further research.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Interview Log 2455-A&#34; hide=&#34;- Interview Log 2455-A&#34;]]
&gt; **Interviewed:** An SCP-2455-1 instance identical to the one produced by test 036. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr ████ (Necessary to cause this instance of SCP-2455-1 to manifest)
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** SCP-2455-1 had been taken to another room so that SCP-2455 would not be involved.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log, 14/██/20██&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr ████:** May I have your name?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2455-1:** ██████ █████.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr ████:** And the girl you were found with, what is her name?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2455-1:** She&#39;s ██████ █████ as well.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr ████:** And the other 2455-1 instances are...?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2455-1:** Idiots.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr ████:** I beg your pardon?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2455-1:** The way I am now my future is either with the Foundation or locked up by the Foundation. I don&#39;t want to be locked up, but //no//, ██████ wants to be a baker...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr ████:** If I may ask, what exactly is your relation to SCP-2455?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2455-1:** She&#39;s my starting point. My &#39;iteration zero&#39;.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr ████:** And her relationship to you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2455-1:** I&#39;m her, as a researcher.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr ████:** We have no records of you working for us.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2455-1:** Well of course not. I haven&#39;t happened yet.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr ████:** Are you from a possible future?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2455-1:** I //am// a possible future. Hers.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr ████:** So, before you manifested, you were...?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2455-1:** Waiting to happen. And here I am!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr ████:** Hmm. Interview concluded for now.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2455-1:** Wait, can&#39;t I join now?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr ████:** If you are what you claim, you know there are procedures that need following. Doubly so for one such as you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2455-1:** But... you can&#39;t! You don&#39;t understand, //I// need to happen now or I never will!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr ████:** SCP-2455&#39;s situation is static for now, however there lies a possibility that - 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2455-1:** That wouldn&#39;t be me, it would be one of the others!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr ████:** 2455-1 - 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2455-1:** [Subject screams in hysterics.]
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** At this point, the overseeing guard aborted the interview. 2455-1 instance immediately vanished.
