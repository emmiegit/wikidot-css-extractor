[[size larger]]Hello! My name is KeeLee, the creator and admin of Just Girly Things. I created JGT because I had a mission: To introduce girls to the great world of girlhood. Unfortunately, so many lovely ladies have gotten lost due to the corruption of our cruel world. With Just Girly Things, our mission is to bring girls back to their roots. Everyone needs some help sometimes, and I&#39;m here to provide it. I have a great team of girls to help me as well, so feel free to contact any of the other girls here if you need some help! Just a reminder- you are not enough. Not until you&#39;ve accepted the true ways of girlhood into your heart. So many girls think that they know how to be a girl, or not be a girl if you ask them. But my way is the true way. I promise you that you can be happier once you give it all up. You&#39;ll find what you&#39;re missing. I hope you can find something that interests you on our little site. We&#39;ve got tons of blog posts and articles that share how you&#39;re supposed to think. So just listen to those, and you&#39;ll be fine! Thanks for checking out our site, ##hotpink|%%title%%!##[[/size]]

[[tab What is JGT?]]

Hello, I&#39;m [[*user DianaBerry]], creator of Just Girly Things. First and foremost, JGT is a psychological horror series meant to capture the horrors of the real world and real people. Transphobia, eating disorders, misogyny- they&#39;re all things we deal with on a daily basis. I wanted to take something that is close to me- girlyness and loving cute things and pink and make it a creepy commentary of the way some people are treated in society. While JGT mostly covers girls, these are issues that are prevalent to all of us of any group. JGT is meant to be realistic horror, in the sense that it is almost something you could see in real life. It is supposed make your skin crawl, make you gag, want to break your computer, the likes. If you hate the characters, it means the author is doing it right. 

**I do NOT agree with the views stated by Just Girly Things in any shape or form, and neither do any of the authors writing for it.**

JGT is a blog site that in-universe has existed since 2006, and existed online since 2010, and still runs to this day. If you want to write in the past or present is up to you.

To include the site theme for JGT in your article, put this:

[[tab Characters]]
You can create any character you want for Just Girly Things, but there are a handful of existing and very important characters. If you have a character you feel should added to this list, please message me and we can discuss it. 

------

##violet|**Jess Landons:**## Around 19 years old, Jess is the most unique member of JGT. She is JGT&#39;s problem child, meaning that she doesn&#39;t always conform to every single rule set up. Jess has high resistance to KeeLee&#39;s reality-bending effects, which obviously upsets KeeLee. KeeLee finds Jess as a challenge, so that&#39;s why she never gives up on her. She is kept under a very close watch by KeeLee. Jess is a victim of sex trafficking and child abuse, which has been hinted at in her featured works. 

**##deeppink|KeeLee:**## The creator of JGT, an abusive control freak reality bender with a thing for pink, PoI-4319, KeeLee is all of these things. KeeLee wants everything to be exactly as //she// wants, and will **make sure** it goes that way. It seems easy to look at her and go &#34;Have her show transphobia there that&#39;s her character.&#34; Keep in mind that not only is KeeLee transphobic, but she is so many other shades of horrible. Explore one you haven&#39;t seen done yet. 

One thing to remember is that KeeLee is **smart**. She&#39;s not easily fooled or easily tracked down. She **gets** what she wants. Most of the time.

If you ask me, KeeLee is not a physical person, but a digital entity. However, this is up to interpretation. First and foremost, KeeLee is a mysterious person who pretends to be a close friend of anyone who talks to her. She wants you to think you&#39;re best friends who know everything about each other. When in reality, no one has scratched the surface of KeeLee.

**###49CC80|Ella:**## Ella is Landon&#39;s older sister. She owns a bakery and is a very ditzy traditional housewife. She is also KeeLee&#39;s right-hand woman. Ella was a good sister to Landon before JGT brainwashed her. It&#39;s up to you if she is beyond saving or not. 

**##coral|Landon/Cora:**## Landon is Ella&#39;s younger brother. He is around age 14 and is a trans man who has been brainwashed into believing he is a girl by JGT. Despite the influence of JGT, if put in the right situation, Landon is capable of temporarily remembering his true identity. 

##black|**PINK FLY/Theresa:**## Theresa Petrucci is a chemist who does graphic design work for JGT. Prior to falling into JGT&#39;s orbit, she had been an organizer of a TERF art collective; sometime in 2009, however, [[[how-to-clean-a-polyester-dress|Theresa met KeeLee]]]. Though she&#39;s generally pleasant to talk to, she can be remarkably cruel, even for a member of JGT. Has a naturally high psychic resistance threshold, due to a traumatic brain injury sustained in high school. Rarely on the website.

It&#39;s important to note that Theresa is //not// brainwashed; everything she does for Just Girly Things, she does of her own free will.

###f299af|**Madeleine von Schaeffer:**## A wealthy ex-aristocrat who provided much of the initial funding for Just Girly Things. Though she doesn&#39;t engage with the magazine or site, she&#39;s kept close correspondence with KeeLee since at least 2005. Proper, polite, and always smiling; most don&#39;t register why her skin doesn&#39;t seem to crease correctly, and fewer still recognize the callous manipulator beneath that porcelain smile.

------

Again, there are other characters, and of course, you can create your own, but these are the main characters. It is not necessary to include any of them in your JGT piece.

Also, depending on when it takes place, the characters may be older or younger. 

[[/tab]]
[[tab How to Write]]
I got into this a little bit in the what is section, but I will fully get into it here. 

JGT can be SCPs or tales, though currently there are mostly tales. JGT is not meant to be physical horror. You can do it, but it needs to be mixed in with psychological horror. JGT should contain some sort of sensitive theme, and your piece needs to take this and explore it. Character-based pieces are the main thing of JGT, SCP or not. 

If you want to do an SCP, it needs to be something that can be linked to JGT. Generally, accounts of JGT don&#39;t warrant their own SCP pages. If you want to do an SCP, do something such as a product, or perhaps a particular person if they have more than just being a member of JGT to offer.

JGT currently has no GOI format, so tales are where you can see most of the blog posts. However, tales do not have to be chat forums or blog posts. If you show a blogpost, you should try to explore your topic through the characters, comments, and content of the post. If you want to do a normal story format, you also need to share the story through the characters and what they go through.

You do not have to tackle something JGT has done before, feel free to add new bigotry to JGT. The only thing they really aren&#39;t is racist, as they&#39;d like to brainwash people of every race and culture. 

JGT members essentially talk like brainwashed aliens pretending to be human women, as that is the effect JGT has on the mind. The mindset JGT sets is not something just anyone can break out of, and it takes a special person to be able to do so due to how it works. JGT is highly contagious, anyone who looks at the website will become infected as long as they are AFAB. AMAB are not affected by JGT, however, there are possible ways they can still be affected. They are just not affected by the website.

Everyone brainwashed is bigoted, and you&#39;re meant to hate them- they&#39;re terrible people. However, remember they used to be normal people, and the only one currently that isn&#39;t human is KeeLee. If you&#39;d like to write another non-human member of JGT, that&#39;s up to you and your creativity. This does not mean you should hate them any less. 

An important thing to note about JGT is that it has no canon. You do not have to follow the continuity of other pieces. If you want to do a portrayal that is different from another one you&#39;ve seen, even different from mine, go ahead! 

One thing is that KeeLee is not meant to be defeated. People can and should be saved, but she will always be there, mimicking the fact that some real-life evil never goes away. 

If you&#39;d like help writing for JGT or have any questions, feel free to contact me, [[*user DianaBerry]].
