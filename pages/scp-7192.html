**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP- 7192 is to be sealed within an 8m x 8m x 8m airtight steel cube. All entry into the containment cell is strictly forbidden unless permission from O5-██ is granted. If anyone is to enter SCP- 7192 they are to be terminated with immediate effect to prevent the spread of SCP- 7192-1.

**Description:** SCP- 7192 is a 5m x 5m x 5m steel cube with no windows and a 2 inch thick tungsten door that does not require a key to enter. D-class tests reveal that the interior of SCP- 7192 has been described to have off white painted walls, a plain white celling with multiple celling lights across SCP- 7192 as well as oak wood floorboards. No reports from D-class testing have revealed any furniture inside of SCP- 7192.

When someone looks inside of SCP- 7192 they are infected by SCP- 7192-1 and become an SCP- 7192-2 instance. Anyone who sees an SCP- 7192-2 instance is also infected with SCP- 7192-1. When someone is infected with SCP- 7192-1 they will show a large range of symptoms which change depending on how far SCP- 7192-1 has progressed. SCP- 7192-1 follows the following general progression: 

**Day 1-2:** 
* Cough
* Sneezing
* Headaches
* Difficulty sleeping
* Stomach Pains

**Day 3-5:**
* Diarrhoea
* Migraines
* Rashes
* Projectile vomiting
* Seizures
* Memory Loss

**Day 6:**
* Joint pains
* Paranoia
* Breathing difficulties
* fevers
* Abdominal pains
* Dysentery

If the SCP- 7192-2 instance makes it to Day 7 at around midday (12:00pm) the instance will die. Autopsies of SCP- 7192-2 instances reveal that the cause of death varies from instance to instance, but the main cause is failure of multiple organs. Other causes death can include:
* Cardiac arrest
* Stomach rupture
* Internal bleeding
* Suffocation
* Immune system failure

Some of these deaths have been linked to symptoms shown during the progression of SCP- 7192-1.

**Addendum. Discovery:** SCP- 7192 was discovered in ████████ England on January 19th 1950 by a group of hikers. After the photo of SCP- 7192 went viral alongside the death of the Hikers from an unknown disease, it caught the attention of multiple Head Researchers at Site-91. 

After further examination of the anomaly, SCP- 7192 was moved to Site- 91 and is yet to breach containment due to its nature.

**Special Containment Procedures:** Every six (6) hours a carton of milk is to be put inside of SCP- 7192 through a tube installed in the celling. 24 hour maintenance is to be provided to the tube to ensure the milk can enter SCP- 7192 without sustaining any damage.

**Description:** SCP- 7192-A is an unknown chemical compound that at room temperature is classified as a gas. When a carton of milk is not put inside of SCP- 7192 every six (6) hours, SCP- 7192-A will begin to rapidly diffuse until all surrounding areas of SCP- 7192 are filled. The only known way to clear away SCP- 7192-A is to put a milk carton inside of SCP- 7192. If the milk carton has sustained any form of damage, the normal effects of the milk carton will not apply.

When someone comes into contact with SCP- 7192-A this person&#39;s skin will begin to decay until the person has no skin left. This process takes around 30 minutes to fully complete and when completed, this person usually dies of hypothermia after around 30 seconds and the person is designated an SCP- 7192-A2 instance

SCP- 7192-A2 instances are people who have been killed due to coming into contact with SCP- 7192-A. SCP- 7192-A2 instances release heavy amounts of SCP- 7192-A and don&#39;t show any signs of being able to naturally decay. The only way for an SCP- 7192-A2 instance to stop producing SCP- 7192-A is for the instance to be completely burned with temperatures of around 300 degrees Celsius. 

**Addendum. Discovery:** SCP- 7192-A and SCP- 7192-A2 was discovered alongside SCP- 7192. 

Containment methods were discovered when researcher ███████ accidently dropped a carton of milk into SCP- 7192 during an exploration of the interior of the room.

**Special Containment Procedures:** No open liquids are to be placed inside of SCP- 7192 at anytime, if this is the case and an SCP- 7192-B2 instance is created, a mobile task force is dispatched to terminate the instances before any further damage is caused.

**Description:** SCP- 7192-B are a colony of a variety of different types of insects living underneath SCP- 7192. The types of SCP- 7192-B instances that have been identified include:
* Maggots
* Earthworms
* Red ants
* Beetles
* Termites
* Millipedes

When any open liquid is exposed to the floors of SCP- 7192 that is not a form of milk, around 5% of the living SCP- 7192-B instances will grow to heights between 10ft and 12ft tall. These grown instances will then attempt to eat and kill all humans that they see, hear or feel. SCP- 7192-B instances can be killed easily with traditional firearms but due to their excessive numbers containment breaches of SCP- 7192-B instances can be deadly.

**Addendum. Discovery:** SCP- 7192-B was discovered during an examination of SCP- 7192&#39;s interior after a containment attempt of SCP- 7192-A was successful. When a D-class spilled water inside the cell, SCP- 7192-B instances began to grow killing 27 researchers and 5 D-classes. All the instances were eventually terminated and Containment Procedures were updated.

**Location:** ████████ ████████ ████████

**Subject:** O5-██

**Notes:** Subject is currently infected with SCP- 7192-O5-1 and has been for around ten (10) years prior to this audio log. During this audio log, subject was not awake and appeared to be in the REM stage of sleep. The following morning, subject appeared scared and confused and didn&#39;t move from their bed for around 2 hours until until they started slowly moving around their bedroom until around 40 minutes later, the subject appeared to return to their senses but for the rest of the day appeared anxious and sluggish.

All audio recordings of this audio log have been redacted from the foundations database due to hearing the original recording can cause severe mental trauma to the listener.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP- 7192 cannot be contained at this present moment, and currently poses the threat of causing a Lifted Veil scenario. The most reliable course of action is to monitor all producers of milk cartons and ensure that the expiry date can be clearly seen by the naked eye. All murders that could possibly be linked to an SCP- 7192 attack, are to be immediately falsified or suppressed to make said murders seem non anomalous. However, if the public does discover any information about SCP- 7192, the said information is to also be immediately falsified or suppressed so the information appears fictional and preventing it being spread through the media as facts.

In order to prevent information about the anomaly to be spread across foundation members who have a security clearance of level 5 or lower ,multiple fake SCP- 7192 documents is to be wrote in order to hide SCP- 7192’s real identity. If a security clearance level 5 or lower foundation member gains any knowledge of SCP- 7192, they are to be immediately administered Class C amnestics to remove the specific memory of when they gained the information. If the amnesties fail to remove the memory of the information, the person who gained the information is to be terminated with immediate effect.

All foundation member’s fridges are to be monitored for any sign of spoiled milk. If any spoiled milk is discovered inside of one of the monitored fridges, the carton is to be removed with immediate effect and disposed of. When a foundation member consumes spoiled milk and puts the milk back into the fridge, the spoiled milk is to be moved to a random island inside of the Pacific Ocean to slow down the SCP- 7192 attack. A Containment Task Force is dispatched to the member’s bedroom and are to monitor them whilst they sleep to attempt containment of SCP- 7192. Protocol SCP-MILK applies to all containment attempt of SCP- 7192(see addendum 1 for information on Protocol SCP- 7192-MILK).

]]


**Description:** SCP- 7192 is currently believed to be a single entity of unknown origins. Witnesses of SCP- 7192 attacks describe it as tall (between 1.9m and 2.1m) with arms that are estimated to be around 1.8m, a humanoid entity with cyan coloured skin that wears black sunglasses that cover the entity’s eyes. Other witness reports reveal SCP- 7192’s mouth has no visible lips and has gums that are estimated to be 5cm tall and teeth that have been described as crooked with signs of tooth decay. During Containment attempts, SCP- 7192 has shown to bleed milk, tests have shown that this milk is identical to any ordinary milk.

SCP- 7192 has multiple anomalous properties including teleportation to anywhere on Earth and possibly to anywhere across the universe, the ability to turn all bodily fluids in any living organism into milk (when SCP- 7192 drinks this milk, damage done to the entity will be immediately healed), the ability to materialize a carton of milk out of its  flesh (this milk holds no anomalous properties) as well as superhuman strength and speed. When SCP- 7192 touches any form of spoiled milk, the affected area will start to decay and burn, the SCP- 7192’s skeleton is the only part of its body unaffected by the spoiled milk.

SCP- 7192 begins its manifestation when someone drinks spoiled milk and puts the carton containing the milk back inside of their fridge (SCP- 7192 will not act if the carton is empty or the carton is disposed of). This person is now designated as SCP- 7192-0. Around two (2) days after SCP- 7192-0 drank the spoiled milk and put the spoiled milk back inside of their fridge at around 1:30am SCP- 7192 will appear by the fridge and begin pouring the spoiled milk on the floor until the carton is fully emptied, SCP- 7192 will then put the milk carton on the nearest surface and will stand by the fridge in a docile state. At around 2:00am, SCP- 7192-0 will wake up and feel a strong urge to go to the room where the fridge is located. When SCP- 7192-0 enters the room where SCP- 7192 is, all audio and video equipment monitoring the room will be disabled and will be enabled at exactly 7:00am. If SCP- 7192 is attacked at anytime when it is by the fridge, the entity will kill the attacker in the same way it kills SCP- 7192-0.

The damage done to SCP- 7192-0 will show multiple parts of their flesh to have been removed and all their bodily fluids will appear to be absent. During autopsies of dead SCP- 7192-0s, all parts of their bodies that would normally contain any form of fluids will show evidence of these areas overrun with milk. Many reports have shown that dead SCP- 7192-0s smell like evaporated milk, however the OUE/m3 of evaporated milk varies from each instance of dead SCP- 7192-0s. The spoiled carton of milk also disappears along with the entity after the attack.

**Addendum 1. Protocol SCP- 7192-MILK:** Protocol SCP- 7192-MILK is a protocol created by 05-██ to attempt to immobilise SCP- 7192 so containment will be easier, all containment attempts that followed Protocol SCP- 7192-MILK have shown greater success then any other containment attempts, however no containment attempt has been successful thus far. The following is the list of procedures within Protocol SCP- 7192-MILK:
* The Containment Task Force are to all distant themselves around 2.5m from each when SCP- 7192 appears.
* Around 10 members of the Containment Task Force are equipped with custom made explosives filled with spoiled milk.
* Two (2) members of the Containment Task Force are to not cause any damage towards SCP- 7192 during the containment attempt, they are instead to supply the rest of the Containment Task Force with spoiled milk explosives.
* One (1) of the members will not use spoiled milk explosives, they will instead have a flamethrower. This member of the Containment Task Force is to only use the flamethrower on dead bodies created by SCP- 7192. This is used to evaporate as much milk from the bodies as possible, so SCP- 7192 has less milk to heal itself with which will theoretically make it easier to immobilise.
* When all members of the Containment Task Force who attacked the entity are killed, the members who didn’t attack the entity are to evacuate the area and are to all be lined up for post mission interviews on the containment attempt.

**Addendum 2. Discovery:** SCP- 7192 was discovered on the 9th of August 1994, after security footage at Site- 91 revealed a mysterious entity pouring a carton of milk from a fridge in Site- 91&#39;s kitchen, junior researcher ████████ then walked to the kitchen before all audio and visual equipment was disabled before enabling itself five (5) hour later. After further research into the entity was conducted and its threats of causing a Lifted Veil scenario were discovered, to prevent mass panic all researchers assigned to SCP were issued class A amnestics by O5-██ and the only people who have access to this document are two (2) members of the O5 council.

**Subject:** Agent-██████, male, 28

**Notes:** The subject was part of the Containment Task Force in charge of Containment Attempt-0001. Subject was the only survivor of the Containment Task Force after the Containment Attempt that was only aborted one and a half hours (1 hour 30 minutes) prior to the interview. When asked if they wanted to perform the interview, the subject agreed but had to be asked multiple times before giving an answer. (This Containment Attempt was performed before the creation of Protocol SCP-7192-MILK). In order to bring SCP- 7192 into a position where a Containment Attempt could happen, D-████ was given spoiled milk to drink so SCP- 7192 would appear at Site- 91 for the Containment Attempt.

After the interview, the subject and interviewer were both administrated Class A Amnestics to prevent the Agent from continuing to be aware of SCP- 7192’s existence. Subject showed confusion after the interview when interviewer was also given amnestics and began trying to ask questions to the administrator of the amnestics.

**[BEGIN LOG]**

**Dr. Christopher Erwick:** Hello Agent-██████ how are you?

**Agent-██████:** C.C.C..Could be better. What was that thing?

**Dr. Christopher Erwick:** To be honest I don’t know either, but I’ve been told to ask you these questions.

**Agent-██████:** (Visibly angry) Well then, I don’t think you have the right to ask me anything about this if you don’t even fucking know anything about it!

**Dr. Christopher Erwick:** (Shouting) I have been commanded to ask these questions to you and conduct this interview so shut fucking fuck up for fuck sake!

**Agent-██████:** (Calming down) Sorry Doctor (pauses) sorry Doctor.

**Dr. Christopher Erwick:** Right! (Also calming down) The first question, can you describe what the entity looks like?

**Agent-██████:** It was tall, and its arms were as big as me! It was wearing sunglasses and was blue. And its mouth... holy shit! It looked like it had gum disease or something they were so thick, and its teeth, they looked crooked and were decaying!

**Dr. Christopher Erwick:** What about its nose?

**Agent-██████:** It had no nose!

**Dr. Christopher Erwick:** Right! Next question, what kind of sounds and noises did it make?

**Agent-██████:** Horrible noises, it was very distorted and was mainly just screaming which I&#39;m pretty sure they were because it was in pain.

**Dr. Christopher Erwick:** How loud were the noises?

**Agent-██████:** : It hurt my eardrums which distracted me, and it appeared the same case for everyone else.

**Dr. Christopher Erwick:** Next question then, did the firearms hurt the entity in any way?

**Agent-██████:** Yeah, they did some decent damage, and it was bleeding milk! But the spoiled milk we were all standing in. It was burning its feet!

**Dr. Christopher Erwick:** Please explain!

**Agent-██████:** It looked like someone was stepping in acid but the someone was that thing, and the acid was milk!

**Dr. Christopher Erwick:** Interesting! Alright, what happened when it killed someone.

//Tears start to form under the subject&#39;s eyes//

**Agent-██████:** Their blood turned into milk, their piss turned into milk! It ripped of parts of their chest and face. IT DRANK THEM!

**Dr. Christopher Erwick:**  Ummm... ok, well... did you see it kill the D-class?

**Agent-██████:** : I was running at that point! But I’d guess it would do the same thing it did  to… to…to the rest of the Task Force.

**Dr. Christopher Erwick:** Thank you Agent-██████ for your time!

**Video log:** 7192-A-190208

**Date:** 19/02/2008

**Time:** 1:42 GMT+1 – 2:01 GMT+1

**Location:** Site- 91, Yorkshire, England

**Subjects:** Agent-1, Agent-2, Agent-3, Agent-4, Agent-5, Agent-6, Agent-7, Agent-8, Junior Researcher ██████.

**Notes:** This Containment Attempt was prior to the creation of Protocol SCP- 7192-MILK. Junior Researcher ██████ had drunk spoiled milk two (2) days prior to the Containment Attempt. All the Agents are a part of a special Containment task force that has been formed by O5- ██ to contain SCP.

This is the only video log that has been recovered from containment attempts of SCP due to how they are disabled when SCP- 7192 attacks SCP- 7192-0. This video log is only accessible by O5-██ and if any Foundation member with level 5 security clearance or lower accesses the following video log, class A amnestics are to be immediately given to the member to prevent them spreading the info within the file.

//Agents have been told to wait for SCP- 7192 to arrive and were to throw spoiled milk at it as well as use their M4A1s if necessary.//

**Agent- 1:** So, we’re just going to watch this guy sleep?

**Agent- 6:** Looks like it yes and throw spoiled milk when whatever we’re supposed to contain shows up.

**Agent- 4:** How the fuck does spoiled milk help this situation?

**Agent- 6:** Why are you fucking asking me?!

**Agent- 2:** Shit guys calm down; you’re going to wake him up!

**Agent- 3:** Well, I want to sleep too, its two in the fucking morning!!

//SCP- 7192 appears by the side of the fridge, opens the fridge and begins pouring the spoiled milk on the ground.//

**Agent- 5:** What the fuck is that?

**Agent- 1:** I think we need to throw spoiled milk at it!

**Agent- 3:** Fuck that I’m shooting it.

//Agent- 3 begins to shoot SCP- 7192//

**Agent- 8:**(Yelling) Stop! Fucking! Stop!

//SCP- 7196 runs towards Agent-3 ripping of several parts of his face off, the entity then starts drinking milk that is slowly pouring out of his nose, mouth, ears and bottom.//

**Agent- 1:** (Screaming) Throw the milk! Fucking throw it whoever the fucking fuck fucking has it!!!

//Agent-8 throws the spoiled milk at SCP- 7192’s face, its flesh starts to decay and burn as it starts to scream!//

**Agent- 8:** Holy shit anyone care to join me!?

//All the alive agents throw spoiled milk at SCP- 7192. SCP- 7192 then runs towards and grabs both Agent-8 and Agent-5.//

**Agent- 5:** (Screaming) Oh god help me! Someone! 

//Agent-1 throws spoiled milk at SCP- 7192&#39;s arms but Agent-5 and Agent-8 both have their faces ripped off and milk starts to pour from their faces.//

**Agent- 7:** (Screaming) Can we abort?! Can we abort?!

//Agent-1 is grabbed and has his chest ripped out with milk pouring from it.//

**Agent- 2:** We can&#39;t abort no matter. (SCP- 7192 grabs Agent- 2 and the subject starts to scream) Oh god help me!

//Agent- 2 continues to scream as his neck is ripped out and milk pours out of it. SCP- 7192 drinks the milk gushing out of his neck and all its wounds heal in an instant!//

**Agent- 7:** Fuck this!

//Agent 7 is grabbed by SCP- 7192 as he attempts to run away, and his spine is ripped out which is covered in milk. As this happens Agent- 4 starts to shout into their walkie talkie.//

**Agent- 4:** Send backup, we&#39;re almost all...

//Agent-4 starts to scream as SCP- 7192 grabs him, and Agent-6 as they are both killed. Junior Researcher ██████ wakes up and starts to scream but SCP- 7192 doesn’t attack the Junior Researcher. Instead, SCP- 7192 sits by the fridge and stares at the Junior Researcher until, at 2:01, all audio and visual equipment of the room is disabled. //

**Description:** SCP- 7192-O5 is O5-██. They appears to be a White British male in their late 60s, Subject shows signs of balding and appears to have no facial as well as blue eyes. SCP- 7192-O5 is the only known person to be aware of any information about SCP- 7192 and it is to stay that way for as long as possible.

Due to their knowledge of SCP- 7192, SCP- 7192-O5 is infected with SCP- 7192-O5-1. SCP- 7192-O5-1 is a mental illness that infects people who have any knowledge about SCP- 7192. SCP- 7192-O5 has has its behaviour monitored since the discovery of SCP- 7192-O5-1 (28 years).

**Year 1-2:**

**Addendum 1. The truth:** The following passage has been wrote by O5-██ about SCP- 7192 and how they plan to keep the anomaly secret from the world:

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
{{If anyone knows anything about SCP- 7192 even know that it exists, they will suffer the horrific symptoms that I have been experiencing for 28 years and if they don&#39;t resist the urges to drink spoiled milk, they will be killed by SCP- 7192. To prevent anyone from knowing that SCP- 7192 exists, I have had three fake documents wrote about a fake version of SCP- 7192 that has little to no correlation to the actual SCP- 7192. These documents are designed to make all of the foundation think they know who SCP- 7192 is so they are un-aware that the real SCP- 7192 exists. The reasoning behind their being three different documents with different security clearance levels is to make SCP- 7192 seem complex and make the higher ups think they know everything there is to know about SCP- 7192. When I die, the youngest member of the overseer council is to read all of the documents on SCP- 7192 and become the new SCP- 7192-O5. Why termination is to happen to any that enter the fake SCP- 7192 is because they would&#39;ve known the truth about the real SCP- 7192 and as if SCP- 7192 were real, it would be mercy due to how horrible the symptoms sound. Whoever is reading this document is the new SCP- 7192-O5 and I have a message directly to you. DO NOT SHARE ANYTHING YOU READ ON ANY OF THESE DOCUMENTS THAT SHARE ANY INFORMATION ON WHAT SCP- 7192 REALLY IS!

||~ Notable SCP- 7192 attacks ||
||~ Location ||~ Year ||~ Description ||
|| Argos, Greece ||Around 1250 BCE || [UNCONFIRMED] An Greek unknown author wrote a story about how they saw a blue god that covered its eyes turned their wife into milk and it drunk all of the milk. It is noted that the author didn&#39;t describe any other features apart from the colour and eyes of the creature so it is possible they were not talking about SCP- 7192 but the mentioning of being turned into milk is oddly similar to SCP- 7192.||
|| Rome, Italy || Around 20 BCE  || [UNCONFIRMED] Multiple Roman scrolls talk about a human with blue skin and a large mouth murdering people by turning them into milk. Multiple wanted posters have also been found that match a few descriptions of SCP- 7192. An important note is that the only descriptions of the face is the mouth no descriptions of the blue human mention sunglasses or a missing nose. ||
|| Kent, England || Around 785AD || [UNCONFIRMED] A book wrote by an unknown Anglo-Saxon was found in an Anglo-Saxon burial ground. The book described how they felt symptoms similar to that of SCP- 7192-O5-1 after reading one of the multiple Roman scrolls that they found buried near their house. The book states they found the scroll when they were gardening. They described their symptoms as: struggling to sleep, seeing demons in their sleep and feeling the urge to drink &#34;old&#34; milk. This is believed to be SCP- 7192 due to when they started feeling the symptoms and them wanting to specifically drink &#34;old&#34; milk. ||
|| Skåne, Denmark || Around 1600 || [UNCONFIRMED] An unknown Danish man wrote about how he accidently served their family some old milk they found under their bed. A few days later they were punished by a God who turned all of their family into milk. It is very likely this was an SCP- 7192 attack but due to it being over 400 years ago, there is no proper evidence of this being true. ||
|| Milan, Italy || 1930 || [CONFIRMED] Around 100 people were killed by SCP- 7192 after a milkman served spoiled milk to these people after finding milk with no clear expiration date in the back of their cupboard. This is the first confirmed SCP- 7192 kill.||
|| Yorkshire, England || 1994 || [CONFIRMED] A Junior Researcher at Site- 91 drank some spoiled milk that had been at the back of the Site- 91 kitchen for around 1 year before it was drunk. SCP- 7192 then killed the Researcher. This was the SCP- 7192 attack that helped the SCP foundation discover SCP- 7192. ||
|| Ohio, United States of America || 2004 || [CONFIRMED] A friend of George W. Bush (the current president of the country at the time) was killed by SCP- 7192 after they drank milk that expired the day before he drunk it. This caused the mysterious murder to be featured on multiple news stations with one of them even getting an interview from the President. After around 16 hours of the story being number 1 on trending. The story was redacted and all people believed to have read any articles related to SCP- 7192 were administered Class C Amnestics. This was the first time SCP- 7192 nearly caused a Lifted Veil Scenario. Despite the immense amount of people who knew about SCP- 7192, no known deaths were related to this incident apart from the President&#39;s friend. ||
|| Gulu, Uganda || 2020 || [CONFIRMED] After a mistake in delivery, a bottle of spoiled milk was accidently given to 22 year old ███████. They were killed and believed to have been the first person in the city to have died that whole week. This is the most recent confirmed SCP- 7192 attack. ||
