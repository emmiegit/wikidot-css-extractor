[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Show Incident Summary&#34; hide=&#34; &#34;]]

+++ Incident Summary:


&gt; Incident 1: On the day of 4/7/08 Foundation forces were sent to investigate reports of anomalous activity in Orange County, Virginia near a motel off the I-64 interstate.  Reaching the destination Foundation Personnel found the place had been recently ransacked and no anomalies to be discovered. 
&gt; 
&gt; Incident 2: 23 days later Foundation agents responded to a report in Germany about a tree in the Black Forest; upon arriving Foundation personnel discovered a hole in the ground where the tree had presumably stood. 
[[/collapsible]]

**Addendum:** Both reports about anomalous activity were sent to necessary Foundation personnel for review before being uploaded to Foundation site servers, prior to agents being sent to investigate as is procedure. Investigations into how outside entities were accessing the information from the outside and how they were beating the Foundation to them were sent to determine exactly how.

**TOPIC:** Re: Investigative report update. 
       
Good afternoon, thank you for your report, all available resources and personnel needed will be granted to your investigation. The site will be open to all searches required after hours. Additionally the site will close at an earlier time, except for necessary staff until this investigation is completed. 

P.S. I noticed your ex-wife was listed. I hope that&#39;s not a conflict of interest? I joke of course but do let us know if you need any extra assistance

Sincerely, Site Director, Dr. Richardson

**Addendum:** Tighter security and scrutiny

Investigators in an effort to find the source of the leak began monitoring and searching mail in and out of Site-16, along with searching where the files were originally uploaded to Foundation site servers and personal computers of those with access, before other sites and departments received the information through secure channels.

A series of fake reports were created, what appeared to be identical files sent to all suspected personnel. Each file was given a unique location, with coordinates. A Foundation MTF Omega &#34;Crowatch&#34; agent was sent ahead to each location, prior to the file being uploaded. 

Two Foundation agents were sent to watch over an abandoned barn in Idaho. Within three hours of the file being uploaded to Foundation servers and sent to each person of interest, agents reported seeing an unmarked black helicopter land in a field while four men in black tactical gear exited the copper and entered the barn. Quickly exiting the barn after discovering nothing inside and leaving the area within minutes. 

Foundation Researcher Dr. Tammy Gale was sent the file with the location of the barn and was detained while investigators searched both her office and home. Dr. Tammy Gale was placed under Foundation custody. No other location was visited by this unknown group, after 24 hrs all agents were called back.

**Update:** Dr. Gale was apprehended before any more Foundation files could be leaked.  Investigators sent to her residence discovered a letter inside, it is unknown where the letter was sent from. The message contained inside &#34;your reward will be great&#34; bank records show no irregularities but investigators found a loose floor board in the house containing nearly $150,000 in cash, along with money, a stack of classified Foundation documents were found. It is unknown how much Dr. Gale has leaked to S.T.R.A.D. pertaining to Foundation operations, and for how long this has been going on. 

A bug out bag[[footnote]] A bag of pre-prepared supplies, when someone needs to leave at a moments notice [[/footnote]] was found believed to be from  S.T.R.A.D. for Dr. Gale if she was ever discovered  by the Foundation. Said bag provided: fake passports, fake IDs, new clothes, a handgun, several small gold and silver bars. Most importantly there was a letter along with cash in various currencies: &#34;Here is a bonus, to the future we build together&#34;. The last thing found was a sealed envelope inside the bag addressed to the Foundation. The purpose of this letter was to be left behind for the Foundation if Dr. Gale was discovered and  managed to escape. The contents of said letter stated her reasons for betraying the Foundation.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Show Incident Summary&#34; hide=&#34; &#34;]]

+++ Incident Summary:


&gt; On the day Dr. Gale&#39;s residence was raided by Foundation agents for evidence, agents searching the house found several listening devices planted around the house in several rooms, shortly after investigators noticed two GOC operatives surveilling the house from a distance. Once Spotted both operatives quickly left, driving away from the scene. GOC representatives questioned about the incident firmly deny any counter-surveillance of Foundation staff or Dr. Gale. 
[[/collapsible]]

Note: Following the finding of this Letter from Dr. Gale&#39;s residence, it is believed that the sender is former Foundation member Dr. Kenneth Ray Berryhill. Dr. Judy Baker has been informed, following previous incidents. [[footnote]] See document [[[A-Letter-From-a-Undesired |A Letter From a Undesired ]]][[/footnote]] Due to this incident Foundation information security is to be updated and tightened so no further incidents like this may occur.
