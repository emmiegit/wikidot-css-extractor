**Item #:** AO-19377033

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** AO-19377033 is contained upside down within a soundproof containment locker. Personnel are advised to wear earplugs.

**Description:** AO-19377033 is a toy school bus measuring 25 centimeters in length. Other than the lack of any branding, it is visually unremarkable.

AO-19377033&#39;s primary anomaly is its ability to continuously produce music, more specifically, the instrumental to the American folk song //The Wheels on the Bus// by Verna Hills. All attempts to halt this ability have failed.

AO-19377033 also possesses the following minor anomalous attributes:
* All wheels spinning simultaneously;
* The windshield wiper stickers animating on AO-19377033&#39;s windshield;
* The steering wheel continuously rotating;
* The sound of a vehicle horn and light emanating from the grill and head lamps respectively at random;
* The sound of an infant crying and loud shushing emanating from the object; this is the loudest sound AO-19377033 produces to date.

AO-19377033 was discovered at a Toys &#34;R&#34; Us store in Indiana, United States after a handful of parents made several noise complaints to the manager. The object was found at the bottom of the bargain bin section. All witnesses were administered Class-A amnestics and AO-19377033 was collected.

##blue| All information written above is scheduled to be updated pending the results of --Incident-AO-19377033-- Addendum-7033.3##

**Incident-AO-7033-01:** On 07/26/1999, various anomalies identified on the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/log-of-anomalous-items|Anomalous Item Catalogue]]] were scheduled to be analyzed for a routine inspection. The inspection went as planned until AO-19377033 was involved.

&gt; //[The door opens, security guards Mike Laud and Bruce Ommer enters the room, the latter is pushing a cart filled halfway with anomalous items. Lauder looks from his clipboard to the wall of containment lockers. Ommer appears visibly strained.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** God, I knew we should&#39;ve saved the microwave and the Boba tea for last. How can they be so heavy?
&gt; 
&gt; **Laud:** That&#39;s for the eggheads to figure out. Can you keep it down? I still need to see--
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** Well they should&#39;ve figured it out already! We&#39;re guards, were supposed to //guard// stuff. This should be a job for the assistant researchers, they hardly do any work anyways--
&gt; 
&gt; **Laud:** Bruce, shut your mouth. Please? I&#39;m... ah, section number eighty-nine. Park it there.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Laud walks to a section of lockers and opens them. Laud beings handing Ommer the items, the latter of which he organizes on the cart. Ommer sighs.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** My point still stands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Laud:** You drew the short straw, Bruce.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** Just because I went along with it, doesn&#39;t mean I agree with it. I mean... picking straws? Ha! Are we trying to safeguard humanity or playing spin the bottle? I mean, Jesus-- Ow, ow! 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Laud opens another locker and both guards immediately cover their ears. AO-19377033 is upside down, its wheels spin wildly, producing a loud noise.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** Aw, that thing again?! For the love-- did you bring the plugs?
&gt; 
&gt; **Laud:** What?!
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** The plugs! Did you bring them?!
&gt; 
&gt; **Laud:** Hold on!... Here it is-- oh... never mind! I forgot!
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** You had them yesterday!
&gt; 
&gt; **Laud:** Well, I don&#39;t have them today!
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** C&#39;mon! It&#39;s-- will this thing shut up! This is-- wait! Wait...
&gt; 
&gt; //[AO-19377033 lowers in volume. Ommer and Laud are able to speak normally. Ommer grabs the objects and scowls.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** Little yellow bastard. Nearly made me deaf.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Ommer tosses AO-19377033 into the cart; it lands on its wheels. The windshield stickers ceases movement. The object emits a quiet honk.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** Did we get them all?
&gt; 
&gt; **Laud:** Do you really want me to answer that question?
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** [Whisper] Goddammit. Well, we&#39;re going to need another cart anyways. Maybe one of the guys left--
&gt; 
&gt; //[AO-19377033 plays its instrumental song at a moderate volume. Ommer clenches his right hand tightly, then massages his temples.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** Hey Mike. How much flak do you think I&#39;ll get if one of our cargo... &#39;accidentally&#39; got damaged in transit?
&gt; 
&gt; //[AO-19377033&#39;s instrumental music suddenly stops. The object slowly turns and moves closer to the guards. They are not paying attention to AO-19377033.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Laud:** Bruce, you know they don&#39;t approve the destruction of anomalous items.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** They won&#39;t approve of it, //that// much. They just want it in the paper work. Hell, I&#39;m willing to bet they&#39;ll //approve// of that. Even they admit it&#39;s annoying.
&gt; 
&gt; //[AO-19377033 begins to vibrate on the cart. Its instrumental music begins to play again.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Laud:** That is true... but still.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** Mike, it sings that damn song all day long and cries like a snot-nosed toddler, that&#39;s it! What&#39;s it going to do for us? Nothing. What happens if it falls in the wrong hands? Also nothing? And what happens if it&#39;s tossed in trash?
&gt; 
&gt; //[Ommer rolls his eyes, smirking.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** Oh, that&#39;s right! Nothin--
&gt; 
&gt; //[AO-19377033 sharply increases its instrumental music&#39;s volume to the loudest to date. Laud and Ommer attempts to cover their ears, with the latter being startled, accidentally knocking the anomaly off the cart and stepping on it in the process.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[The instrumental music instantly stops. Ommer pauses and lifts up his foot; AO-19377033 is crushed and inanimate.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** For the record I was joking.

As Ommer unintentionally destroyed a minor anomalous item with an extremely low-research priority, he was only given a warning. AO-19377033 was declared neutralized and was scheduled to be incinerated at a later date.

**Addendum-7033.1:** In the following weeks, multiple personnel had complained to human resources regarding to the behavior and actions taken by Ommer. Ommer had not only disrupted the work of others, but also have been accused of being unstable. Below are a partial series of incidents that support this claim.

&gt; 
&gt; **Laud:** Are you seeing this Bruce?! Man, I never thought he&#39;d strangle the guy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** It&#39;s a show about the mafia, Mikey. I&#39;m surprised they don&#39;t tear the tongues out of their necks on a daily basis.
&gt; 
&gt; **Laud:** Touché. But this is something else.
&gt; 
&gt; **Palmer:** Yeah, it&#39;s brutal.

&gt; **Trible:** Hear what?

&gt; **Ommer:** Um... never mind, sir. It seems that the glitch... solved itself? Yes. It&#39;s all fixed now. Sorry for bothering you.

&gt; **Foreword:** Below is a witness account from Mike Laud.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for coming out with this stuff out of the blue but I didn&#39;t know who to talk to. It concerns Bruce. No, he didn&#39;t do anything to me, it&#39;s just... I don&#39;t think he&#39;s... not in a good spot right now? Well... alright here me out, this literally just happened so bear with me here.
&gt; 
&gt; So just before my shifted ended I went to the restrooms to do my business. At that point, I saw Bruce barge in and locked himself in the stall next to me.
&gt; 
&gt; I heard him groaning and huffing, at first I thought he was really straining, but then I realized he didn&#39;t touch the toilet seat. Next thing I know he&#39;s banging at the walls and shouting and... I think he almost cried at one point? Then he starts muttering to himself. It was hard to hear but I think he was chanting something... a mantra?
&gt; 
&gt; Then he got up to wash his face and left. Guess he woke up on the wrong side of the bed, huh?

&gt; **Ommer:** I need to make an announcement. Like right now.

After the latest incident, Ommer was detained following his outburst. Due to the belief his psychological impairments were a result of excessive stress and being a valued member of personnel, Ommer was detained in a holding cell until a full-fledged psychiatric analysis was conducted. 

**Addendum-7033.2:** On 08/31/1999, Ommers was discovered to be absent from his cell. The Site was searched thoroughly, and although he wasn&#39;t present in the facility, official documentation permitting him to leave was found and had the Site Director&#39;s signature on it.[[footnote]]The Site Director confirmed they did not sign the document.[[/footnote]]

Foundation agents searched Ommer&#39;s residence but were unable to locate him. A journal and camcorder was recovered during the investigation. The journal was located on top of his bed.

&gt; Hello there, I have a diary now.
&gt; 
&gt; Long story short, Brook forced me into the &#39;write about your feelings and talk about it club.&#39; Don&#39;t ask.
&gt; 
&gt; So yeah, another chore I have to deal with until the end of the year. Yay.

&gt; Never mind. This book may be useful after all. 
&gt; 
&gt; We recently gotten a new object today and it&#39;s annoying. For godsake I thought it was a cat dying to get it on with a Speak N Spell or something. I asked it to be transferred but they give me the same bullshit:
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;ThInK oF tHe ScIeNcE!&#34;

&gt; 
&gt; Blah blah blah.
&gt; 
&gt; Do I have to fix the problem myself?

&gt; For the love of god, I was joking!
&gt; 
&gt; Long story short, I kind of stepped on it and it&#39;s trash now. Got some flak for it but at least they didn&#39;t fine me.

&gt; Okay now I feel like crap,
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m getting the shivers here and there and my ears occasionally ring. It&#39;s annoying. That or we have a rat in the Site. Again.

&gt; Yep, I&#39;m definitely hallucinating.
&gt; 
&gt; I told Brooks about the squeaking but he doesn&#39;t seem to care[[footnote]]Brooks has no knowledge of this event.[[/footnote]]. So what, do I just wait it out or go to a hospital? I forgot what exactly you&#39;re supposed to do in the hand book... I think.
&gt; 
&gt; It&#39;s manageable, but I keep getting these yellowish blurs in the corner of my eye. It&#39;s annoying.

&gt; Someone&#39;s screwing with me.
&gt; 
&gt; I was back from break when there was a bunch of kiddie crap on my computer from this website called YouTube[[footnote]]No mention of this &#39;YouTube&#39; was found on the internet.[[/footnote]] I think? I don&#39;t know, all I remember is that a bunch of them had a smiling watermelon on it. It was gone when I tried to show Brooks. Maybe it&#39;s a prank?

&gt; = **YOU**
&gt; 
&gt; = **ARE**
&gt; 
&gt; = **MINE**
&gt; 
&gt; //[Several smudges in the form of black lines are present on the bottom of the page.]//

&gt; Fuck.

&gt; Now it&#39;s haunting me! I told the Site. What&#39;s taking so damn long?![[footnote]]No one at the Site has memory of this event occurring.[[/footnote]] Is it only me?
&gt; 
&gt; Now that I think about it... things have been getting a bit quieter than usual.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m screwed am I?

&gt; Jackpot!
&gt; 
&gt; I found out singing makes it stops bothering me for a little bit. It&#39;s not permanent, but it&#39;s better than nothing. 
&gt; 
&gt; I think I could make this work.

&gt; I can&#39;t, I //really// can&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; The more it comes out, it louder I have to sing... in public.
&gt; 
&gt; It&#39;s mocking me.
&gt; 
&gt; I need to hide for a while? Maybe at another Site. Just gotta do this seminar and then I can come up with an actual solution.

&gt; **Ommer:** Fuck, fuck, fuck! Shit, shit shit shit! God, god, god, god--fuck!
&gt; 
&gt; //[Just as the lights intensive behind him, Ommer enters the garage and locks the door. He gets into his car and starts the engine. The engine sputters.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** Oh no, no! Don&#39;t you dare do this to me!
&gt; 
&gt; //[A loud bang is heard. The door is becomes slightly dented and the area of the wall around it becomes cracked. The engine starts. Ommer becomes ecstatic. The door and wall dents and cracks further respectively. Ommer activates the garage opener; the door doesn&#39;t activate.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** Huh?!
&gt; 
&gt; //[Ommer opens the back of the garage opener. The batteries are missing. The door is rammed off its hinges.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** Fuck it!
&gt; 
&gt; //[Ommer slams on the pedal and rams through the garage door. The car skids as it exits the neighborhood. After some time, Ommer reaches the toll road and looks at the rearview mirror. He chuckles.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** Fuck you.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Ommer turns on the car radio. The instrumental to The Wheels on the Bus plays.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** Fuck me.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Loud honking is heard as Ommer&#39;s car abruptly lurches forward, followed by the activation of headlights from behind. Ommer tries to drive away but is continually rammed by the bus. As Ommer travels up the switchback road, Ommer&#39;s car is knocked off course and crashes in the side of the mountain.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[The footage momentarily glitches before resuming with Ommer hanging upside down in his seat. Ommer unbuckles himself and falls to the floor in pain. He then grabs the camcorder and exits the vehicle.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[Ommer looks to his left; the bus slowly approaches him as the sounds of crickets play in the background. Ommer looks to his left and sees a large tree branch close to the guard rail. The bus honks continuously and its quickly gains speed.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[Ommer yelps as he climbs onto the tree branch, just missing the bus. Ommer continues to move forward until he reaches the trunk and holds onto it tightly. He looks behind himself and sees the bus positioned forward towards it. The bus remains stationary before driving up the road.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[After a moment of silence, Ommer laughs to himself, nearly crying in the process. He takes in several deep breaths but stops when the crickets vocalize themselves to the tune of The Wheels on the Bus. Ommer whimpers before a loud honk is heard from above.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Ommer:** ...No.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Ommer looks up. The bus is positioned forward on a section of road above the tree. Ommer shakes his head frantically several times. The bus lightly bounces the frontside of itself several times before reversing back and ramming through the guard rail. The bus rapidly freefalls towards Ommer&#39;s direction.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[Ommer screams as the screen is blinded by light. The footage abruptly ends.]//

**Addendum-7033.3:** Unlike what was depicted in the footage, Ommer&#39;s residence did not appear to suffer any form of damage with the exception of the garage door. The camcorder was recovered near a toll road, next to a tree that had recently fallen over.

Underneath the tree was an anomalous item nearly identical in appearance to AO-19377033[[footnote]]It should be noted that the original instance of AO-19377033 was never incinerated, as the trash bag it was stored was reported missing.[[/footnote]] with the exception of three holes being present on its windshield and its front-left tire being damaged. 

This new object emitted similar sounds to AO-19377033 with the addition of a new sound; instead of an infant crying, it now emits the sound of a adult male voice whimpering alongside  a series of shushes in an excited tone.

SCP-7033&#39;s object class was changed from neutralized to pending.
