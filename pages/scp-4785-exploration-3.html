**Transcript generated by TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic**

&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** //&lt;Mid-sentence.&gt;// —cause we— wait, one of the lights on the recorder just— did I have the recorder off the whole time?
&gt; 
&gt; **TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic:** ✔️ Affimative. ✔️
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Researcher Dylan sighs.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** I&#39;ll start from the beginning. I went through the door with the square on it from the cabinet last time, and I ended up back in the big city. I found a tunnel that went to the big skyscraper in the middle of the city, which didn&#39;t have any boards, for whatever reason.
&gt; 
&gt; Elevator was broken— well, not broken, but TSAT kept telling me that it wasn&#39;t stable. I took the stairs, but the upper floors were blocked by the web shit, and I know I don&#39;t want to touch that. Don&#39;t want another one of the lizards chasing me again. Anyways, I went downstairs, and there was a big hole in the concrete floor, and I climbed down that and now I&#39;m in this big secret lab, like the basement back at Site-31.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Pause.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; I think that&#39;s everything. Anyways, It&#39;s dark in here, but we found a terminal, and TSAT&#39;s trying to hack it to get the lights on. I&#39;ve been standing here for the past few minutes, waiting for—
&gt; 
&gt; **TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic:** ✔ Vulnerability Found, Login Completed ✔ — 💡 Activating lights...
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Click from lights activating.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Now I can see the rest of the room... It&#39;s pretty white, sterile, except for the green web, which I didn&#39;t see coming in. I&#39;m lucky I avoided it. There&#39;s some doors, but they&#39;re blocked with the green web. The terminal&#39;s in front of a window, looking into a testing room, from the looks of it. It&#39;s labeled &#34;Greenroot Holdings Inc.&#34; I don&#39;t see how you&#39;re supposed to get in.
&gt; 
&gt; **TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic:** 🔎 Mainframe analysis complete, executable program found. ❓ Should I execute it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Go ahead. Let&#39;s see if this still works.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Whirring noises, presumably from the machine activating.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Okay, there&#39;s a, uh, chemistry set, that came out of a hole in the wall, inside of the test chamber. There&#39;s something red and clear in the vials, I&#39;m not a chemist, I can&#39;t tell what it is. Another hole opened up on the other side of the room; if something&#39;s supposed to be coming out of it, it&#39;s broken.
&gt; 
&gt; There&#39;s something extending out of the table holding the chemistry set. It&#39;s like a syringe, but it looks longer. It&#39;s still... extending out.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Whirring noises for 5 seconds, then the noises suddenly cease.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** It... it stopped. I don&#39;t know—
&gt; 
&gt; **Mechanical Voice:** //&lt;Loud.&gt;// ERROR: SUBJECT NOT PRESENT WITHIN CHAMBER. PLEASE REACTIVATE TESTING ONCE CHAMBER IS FULLY OCCUPIED.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Wait! Shit, shit—
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;High-pitched roaring from one of the hallways, similar to that of the lizard-like creature from the initial incursion.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** I need to hide, need to hide...
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Metal banging, followed by Researcher Dylan hyperventilating. Footsteps, combined with a wet, squishy sound, come from the room.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;The creature then leaves the room. Researcher Dylan attempts to exit his hiding place, but it will not open.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** It— it left behind more of the weird green stuff, like a spider. Webbed the cabinet shut. I guess that&#39;s, that&#39;s what it&#39;s about—
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;A shout from Researcher Dylan, followed by the sudden deactivation of the audio recorder. The audio recorder is reactivated 1 minute and 36 seconds later.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcer Dylan:** —it, my arm, my arm... leaned backwards, and I fell into some... I can&#39;t tell. I&#39;m back in the slime room. It somehow took me back to the slime room, what the hell? Where did I come from?
