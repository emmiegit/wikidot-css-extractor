Professor: 

@@     @@First, permit me to again express my gratitude for allowing me to take the anomaly to Boston. Although I value Mr. Hutchinson&#39;s opinion in matters of mathematics and fluid turbulence, his opinion on &#39;female science&#39; (as he would call it) is to his detriment. You informed me once that you are not a man of God. Nevertheless, I know you shall take no insult when I say that your faith in me is quite Christian of you.
@@     @@Mr. Scranton has been of extraordinary service. His laboratory would give the so-called &#39;Wizard of Menlo Park&#39; pause. It is well-stocked with all the latest advances in electrodynamics and radiology. The use of his Geiger counter (a splendid machine that vastly simplifies the detection of alpha particles) has led to a most remarkable discovery: The anomaly produces not only warmth, but radiation.
@@     @@This is not all. After modifying his Geiger counter to record pulses of radiation, I came upon an even more startling discovery: A pattern which repeats approximately every sixteen hours. Six &#39;clusters&#39; of pulses, each separated by an equally spaced interval. Each cluster contains more pulses than its predecessor. I have observed this first-hand on twelve occasions, now. Each time, I have counted the number of pulses in each cluster:
@@     @@The first cluster always contains two pulses. The second, three. The third, five. The fourth, seven. The fifth, eleven. And the sixth, thirteen.
@@     @@Two, three, five, seven, eleven, and thirteen. The first six primes.
@@     @@There is one more discovery I wish to relate to you, but in doing so, I must confess an error committed during our prior conversation in September. I stated that the anomaly was impermeable to radiation. I came to this conclusion based on radiation failing to pass through it. However, Mr. Scranton correctly pointed out that this is not the same as being impermeable. I therefore have tested to see if radiation is being //deflected//. 
@@     @@It is not.
@@     @@It absorbs radiation, Professor. Perhaps it even transmits it.
@@     @@I suspect the pattern we have observed is a message. One that originated from whence this object came. And I suspect that, with some work, we can send a message back.

Always with fondness,
@@     @@Miss Annette Lang
