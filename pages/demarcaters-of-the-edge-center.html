&gt; [[/=]]



As a **rather old but loosely organized academic organization**, the SCP Foundation has had more than 30,000 members worldwide since its website was launched in 2000, although this is still a small number. These lore enthusiasts, conspiracy theorists, and curious bloggers are now becoming professional under the guidance of experts in various fields, and have developed their own unique and effective modus operandi, contributing to the explanation of anomalies in their own way, including working with local governments to secure and contain some possible anomalies, etc.

Due to the lack of large armed forces, SCP Foundation members usually join government response teams as consultants during investigations. In most cases, due to the lack of containment facilities, SCP Foundation members can only advise the governments to help them better secure, contain and protect the anomalies. In addition, SCP Foundation members also make recommendations to clients on how to reduce adverse effects such as personal injury, property damage, etc. when working on private commissions.

Currently, SCP Foundation members are still active in all corners of the world, exploring the secrets that are not known to the public.

[[tab History]]


Second Industrial Revolution - The Valentinos, which have moved from Florence to Britain to do business, open factories and thus complete the primitive accumulation of capital.

1860 - The Valentinos found Alexylva University near Rome, making an outstanding contribution to local education.

1889 - Alexylva University in Scotland is founded. The first president is Hailcloud Jefferson, a close friend of the Valentino patriarch Luca Valentino and an outstanding educator. The school excels in medicine, occultism and folklore.

1892 - Luca Valentino travels to the United States to make an unofficial visit to Miskatonic University as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Alexylva University, while establishing his own trading company.

1895 - Alexylva University organizes a scientific expedition to Southeast Asia. The expedition of 32 people left Aberdeen on RV //Albatross// and returned to Aberdeen in the second half of the year. In the report, the members of the expedition &#34;suffer from a strange illness&#34;.

Early 1900s - The Italian campus of Alexylva University is closed due to poor management. Most of the staff and students left for Britain. In the same year, Luca Valentino passes away and his son Raul Valentino takes over his work.

1908 - Alexylva University establishes the &#34;Horizon&#34; Society. The society is founded by folklore professor Allen Aidman and students Jacqueline Griffin, Nora Lawrence, and Jimmy Valentino with the goal of exploring paranormal phenomena in the world.

1914 - World War I breaks out. Alexylva professor Allen Aidman fights in the British Army before disappearing at the Battle of the Somme.

1919 - Allen Aidman is found living as &#34;Albert&#34; in Paris, France. He has no memory of what happened during the years of his disappearance.

1921 - The Valentino Foundation is established in the United States. That same year, Raul Valentino and Jacqueline Griffin disappear during an expedition to South America and their whereabouts are unknown. Raul Valentino&#39;s cousin Fernand takes over his position. In the same year, Chinese nationals Zhou Wanqing and Sun Shaomin enroll in Alexylva University to study medicine.

1930 - Zhou and Sun return to China. Lewis Alonso, representing Alexylva University on an academic visit to Miskatonic University, participates in the Antarctic scientific expedition organized in September and writes a long report afterwards.

1931 - Under the leadership of the Valentinos, the SCP Foundation is established in New York to promote education and scientific research. Jason Kennedy serves as Chairman of the Foundation and participates in and establishes many of the Foundation&#39;s rules.

World War II - Foundation members have collected a great deal of material. The originals of these archives are now housed in the New York Liaison Office of the SCP Foundation.

1959 - Alexylva professor Stephen Griffin organizes the first &#34;Horizon&#34; forum. The purpose of the forum is to promote scientific attention to paranormal phenomena. The conference is sparsely attended and fails to make a splash in the academic community. After the meeting, the scientists announce the Horizon Initiative and agree that the forum will be held every March.

1966 - Alexylva University and Miskatonic University form a joint scientific research team to Africa.

1972 - James Valentino, a student at Alexylva University, is introduced to and become interested in the Horizon Initiative forum. He then joins this academic organization and becomes close to Griffin.

1975 - James Valentino goes to Miskatonic University in the United States to study occultism. Murdoch Griffin becomes socially active and befriends the American geologist William Miles. Miles then returns to the United States and uses his influence to hold the Horizon Initiative academic forum in his country.

1976 - Valentino meets Miles, and the two become close friends. Valentino returns to Britain in the late 70s to pursue his scientific career with the help of the Foundation.

1985 - Miles disappears during an expedition and his body is never found. At the end of the year, a funeral is held without the body, attended by all members of the American Horizon Initiative forum.

1986 - James Valentino takes over the SCP Foundation and continues to promote education and scientific research internationally.

1987-1991 - With the financial support of the SCP Foundation, Griffin conducts several worldwide expeditions, which are very fruitful. Valentino and 26 people, including David Bergin, a professor in the Department of Archaeology at Alexylva University, Wang Weimin, an international student in the Department of Geology, and Abdullah Rahim Khan, a student in the Department of Biology, go on an expedition to the Amazon jungle in South America and are attacked. Only 7 of them survive.

1992 - Valentino, along with Griffin, Wang, Bergin and 13 others, announces the expansion of the SCP Foundation from the original Horizon Initiative to support the study of the supernatural. The total number of members is 237.

1993 - The British government and the SCP Foundation collaborate on a scientific expedition to Antarctica. The expedition suffers an accident and six people die.

1995 - Ian Hamilton, an MBA graduate, joins the James Valentino Foundation and later the SCP Foundation, leading his team to establish a more effective management system. That same year, Valentino unexpectedly disappears during a scientific expedition, and the Valentino Foundation is run by his eldest son, Al.

1997 - Dissatisfied with the theological worship that exists within the foundation, Wang leaves the SCP Foundation and founds the organization &#34;Frontiers of Science&#34;, which attempts to explain anomalous phenomena with materialism. However, the two academic organizations still communicate with each other.

1998 - Several governments begin working with the SCP Foundation.

1999 - In cooperation with the Frontiers of Science, the SCP Foundation establishes its first liaison office in China. That same year, Al resigns as Chairman of the Valentino Foundation due to poor management and is replaced by his sister Ariana.

2000 - The website of the SCP Foundation is launched on the Internet. In the same year, the Foundation begins to consult with several governments and establishes some stable channels of cooperation.

2004 - The first New Horizon Forum is held, attracting 2,789 participants from 27 countries around the world.

[[tab Organization]]

+ SCP Foundation

The SCP Foundation is a loose, global, nonprofit academic organization that conducts scientific research based on the principles of &#34;Support, Classify, Protect&#34; while providing advisory services to governments and individuals on anomalous phenomena. It currently has permanent liaison offices in New York, Moscow, Paris, London, Beijing, Buenos Aires, Johannesburg and Sydney, as well as several other offices.



++ Personnel

See the &#34;Personnel&#34; tab.

++ Online
[[/=]]

@@@@
+++ Website and Telegram Chat Room

Established in 2000, the SCP Foundation website is the main hub of activity for SCP Foundation members. Its encrypted server is located at a permanent Foundation office.

The website currently has four main sections: Announcement Board, Database, Forum and Contact Office.
@@@@

+++ Announcement Board

The Site Staff is responsible for the Announcement Board, whose functions include sitewide announcements of confirmed anomalies, potential anomalies, new academic activities, and other matters.

@@@@
@@@@
+++ Database

The Database is the core part of the SCP Foundation website. It can be further divided into the Archive and the Support Hub.

++++ Archive

The Site Archive is used to store case materials and investigative reports prepared by SCP Foundation members. The Site Staff regularly reviews and removes documents that are suspected of being forged or not sufficiently substantiated to be credible, and holds the contributors accountable.

The Archive also contains information on all known systematic paranormal techniques, such as voodoo, black magic, and invocation, and invites professional members to compile them for members&#39; reference.

See the Membership Rules for more details on punishment.

++++ Support Hub

Since its inception, the SCP Foundation has entered into cooperative agreements with many governments to assist in their efforts to maintain normalcy through the provision of consultants or task forces. In return, governments provide some level of support to the SCP Foundation&#39;s efforts. The Support Hub has compiled information on the emergency contact information of relevant government agencies and the addresses of facilities that can provide assistance to SCP Foundation members in the various countries with which the SCP Foundation cooperates.

The Support Hub also provides SCP Foundation members with professional guidance on operational procedures to minimize casualties among SCP Foundation members.

@@@@

+++ Forum

The Forum is one of the most important components of the SCP Foundation website. However, with the advent of Telegram, the Forum&#39;s popularity has declined slightly. Currently, the Forum is mainly focused on professional discussions, including containment and handling of some anomalous objects, etc.
@@@@

+++ Contact Office

The Contact Office is an instant page where staff and government liaisons are online 24/7 to provide actionable advice and liaison services for SCP Foundation members to better coordinate response to some mild anomalies and anomalous events.

@@@@
+++ Telegram Chat Room

A chat for SCP Foundation members and government officials.

------
[[=]]
++ Offline
[[/=]]

@@@@
+++ Office

These small offices are the primary offline presence of the SCP Foundation, which has offices in many of the countries it works with to better coordinate its work with governments or to conduct private paranormal investigations. The offices also serve as a base of operation for the SCP Foundation, usually with **three to five full-time SCP Foundation staff members** stationed there for day-to-day operations.

Most offices are located in inexpensive office buildings or old neighborhoods, most of which are less than 100 square meters. These locations are relatively inexpensive to lease/renovate.

A complete office usually consists of the following elements.

**Office Area**: The main area of the office where full-time SCP Foundation members work, responsible for website operations, data collection and organization, staffing, and external liaison.

**Ready Room**: The Ready Room is where SCP Foundation members are equipped. A well-stocked Ready Room should contain as much PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) as possible. A handful of offices contain a small number of handguns and ammunition.

**Decontamination Area**: Some well-equipped offices may be equipped with a complete decontamination system. However, such equipment is not common.

**Reception Area**: The Reception Area is used to receive visitors.

**Meeting Room**: Used by SCP Foundation members for academic seminars.


@@@@

+++ Liaison Office

The SCP Foundation&#39;s main external link is the Liaison Offices, which are responsible for communicating and coordinating with the governments on issues of concern. Liaison Offices are usually located in national administrative centers and major cities to better serve local governments.
@@@@

+++ Storehouse

Storehouses are the SCP Foundation&#39;s storage facilities. Low-risk objects collected by SCP Foundation investigators are designated and contained in the storehouses for research by SCP Foundation members and government research departments. The storehouses are usually guarded by government-appointed armed forces and are subject to strict confidentiality measures.

+++ New Horizon Forum

The New Horizon Forum is led by private and governmental academic organizations, including the SCP Foundation, the Frontiers of Science, the UIU and Office XIX, and is held every two years. It aims to promote research to explain anomalous phenomena.



[[/tab]]

[[tab Personnel]]

++ James Valentino Foundation

The James Valentino Foundation is the primary sponsor of the SCP Foundation and one of its major investors. It was established in New York in the 20th century and is named after the most prominent member of the Valentino family. It is dedicated to the advancement of education and research, but is not responsible for the specific operations of the SCP Foundation.



@@@@
++ SCP Foundation Members

Although the SCP Foundation is small, its members come from all walks of life. All members of the SCP Foundation are required to have higher education and professional training, and become full members of the SCP Foundation after a two-month probationary period by passing an examination. According to the length of working time in SCP Foundation, they can be classified as

**Full-timers** and **Part-timers**.

Please note that there are unique circumstances regarding whether a member works part-time. This categorization is only general and does not mean that other situations do not exist.


**Full-timers** include the following categories.

+++ O5 Council

The O5 Council is the primary governing body of the SCP Foundation and is composed of representatives from the Site Staff, the Scientists, the Secretariat and the Investigators. It is responsible for the financial management and operation of the SCP Foundation.

+++ Secretariat

The Secretariat is primarily responsible for recording the Council&#39;s meetings, collecting and sifting the supernatural descriptions captured by the web crawlers, and passing them on to the Site Staff for posting to the site.

+++ Public Affairs Department

The Public Affairs Department is the primary external liaison department responsible for the SCP Foundation&#39;s relationship with national governments.

+++ Site Staff

The Site Staff is the management of the SCP Foundation website and is responsible for the operation and management of the SCP Foundation website. The Site Staff is responsible for regularly classifying and archiving the content of the site, updating the information, verifying posted content, dealing with hoax posts, banning users for inappropriate behavior, etc.


+++ Office Staff

An established office typically includes the following types of members.

**IT Staff**: Responsible for the basic maintenance and use of electronic equipment in the office. Also provides technical support to SCP Foundation members.

**Archival Staff**: Responsible for entering and maintaining files within the office.

**Medical Staff**: Responsible for basic first aid and wound care.

**Occult Staff**: Responsible for information and decision making for SCP Foundation investigators.

**External Liaison Staff**: Responsible for external liaison.

Other possible employees are

**Cleaning Staff**: Responsible for daily cleaning.

**Security Staff**: Responsible for office security. Such employees are relatively rare.

**Anomalous Staff**: Such employees are relatively rare. The SCP Foundation currently has only five such employees on file.

———

@@@@


**Part-timers** include the following categories.

**Investigator**: Investigators are an important part of the SCP Foundation and are the **official** field staff of the SCP Foundation. Investigators have a relatively loose organizational structure and basically work independently. Investigators may include occult enthusiasts, geographers, grave robbers, biologists, journalists, retired soldiers, Miskatonic professors, and other people who enjoy or have been exposed to paranormal phenomena. Investigators tend to be highly educated and have a passion for exploring the world behind the Veil.

Investigators may determine the events and objectives of their investigations through their own sources or through public announcements on the SCP Foundation website. Most investigations are conducted independently[[footnote]]The term &#34;independent&#34; in this context refers to the fact that the only forces involved in the investigation process are those of the SCP Foundation.[[/footnote]], but Investigators may seek assistance from the SCP Foundation and government agencies through the website and other contact channels.

At the conclusion of the investigation, an Investigator typically writes a full report of the investigation and posts it on the SCP Foundation website. The Foundation and government agencies provide financial incentives to the team or individual based on the content of the investigation, the completeness and authenticity of the report, and the performance of SCP Foundation members during the operation.

**Investigation Consultant**: Investigation consultants are the most experienced investigators, usually professors and researchers. They usually have multiple interactions with paranormal phenomena. Some consultants (but only a handful) are even able to use anomalous objects to a certain extent. They are active in various scientific studies and social investigations organized by the governments, and even in some special operations to provide professional advice to the governments on containing and explaining the anomalies.

See the &#34;Investigators&#34; tab for more details.

**Researcher**: Most SCP Foundation researchers are also part-time. Due to the nature of the SCP Foundation as an academic institution, researchers usually conduct low-risk scientific research at their own workplaces. High-risk scientific research is transferred to the Siberian Research Institute of the SCP Foundation, where it is carried out by specialized scientific teams.











[[/tab]]

[[tab Investigators]]

+ Investigator

The Investigators of the Foundation are the backbone of the Foundation. They work all over the world, using their courage and enthusiasm to explore places beyond the reach of ordinary people, seeking the truth behind ancient legends and urban myths.

The main task of the Investigators is to track, observe and record all kinds of anomalous events, write their own reports and post them on the Foundation&#39;s website for archiving. Many highly educated Investigators report anomalies in typical reportage at the end of their investigation. Others, such as bloggers and surfers, are more likely to record their observations in memoirs, or even video and audio, supplemented by looser reportage.

+ Information Source

There are a variety of information sources available to Foundation employees, some of which are listed below.

++ Internet

The Internet is the most direct and widely used source for the Foundation. The Foundation&#39;s web crawlers automatically search the web for relevant descriptions and send them to the Secretariat. The Secretariat collates these entries and forwards them to the Site Staff for a second review, who then post them on the website for interested Investigators to examine.

++ Offline Consultation

Offline consultation is another source of information for the Foundation. A small number of people may learn the addresses of the Foundation&#39;s offices from various sources and come for consultation.

++ Government Invitation

Foundation members may also be invited to participate in the activities of relevant government agencies in the investigation of paranormal events. They usually participate in an advisory capacity in order to provide advice to government agencies.

+ Investigation

In general, there are two types of investigations, **Independent Investigation** and **Team Investigation**.

++ Independent Investigation

Anomalous incident investigations conducted by investigators independently (or with a team of typically no more than five people). Investigators conducting independent investigations typically do not have highly specialized equipment (e.g., mobile chemical suits) and often request material or technical assistance from the Foundation&#39;s offices when needed. The Foundation usually provides the needed supplies within 48 hours by courier.

The lack of specialized equipment often puts these Investigators at greater risk. Investigators must take special care to avoid unnecessary harm to themselves.


++ Team Investigation

A Team Investigation is a scientific study of anomalous phenomena (or anomalous locations and objects), which Foundation investigators participate in (or organize). Investigators working in teams are more professional and experienced than those working independently. The equipment they use is also more professional and efficient, and supplies are usually more adequate.

















[[/tab]]

[[tab Other Orgs]]

In addition to the SCP Foundation, there are other loose paranormal organizations, mainly in the form of small cults and civilian &#34;psychics&#34;. Here is a list of organizations that have more to do with the Foundation and are of a certain size for reference.[[footnote]]Guess which groups correspond to which GoIs in the baseline universe![[/footnote]]

++ Parawatch Wiki

The Parawatch Wiki has a good relationship with the SCP Foundation. The Parawatch staff also includes members of the Foundation. Some members have used Parawatch as a stepping stone to the Foundation. The Foundation site staff also reviews the urban legends in the Wiki and selects the most credible ones to post on the Announcement Board.

++ Church of the Broken God

The Church of the Broken God is a niche religion that still believes in the existence of WAN. It interprets certain mechanical failures as the will of God. It currently has around 300,000 followers on TikTok.

++ Klein Lab

Klein Lab is a Middle East based biotechnology company dedicated to research and development in the field of biotechnology with several patented technologies in the field of medicine. It has one of the best biological laboratories in the world.

++ Three Moons Corporation

The Three Moons Corporation is a private military contractor.

++ Anderson Robotics

Anderson Robotics is one of the top 100 robot manufacturers and developers in the world. Its robots are widely used in medical, manufacturing, emergency rescue, and many other applications. Their military exoskeleton technology is also used by several national armies.

++ Gamers Against Weed

A satirical social group with over 10 million followers on the web.

++ United Nations Office for Paranormal Affairs

A UN agency that exists in name only.

&gt; A small office with a few ne&#39;er-do-wells counting money. Home to exiled officials and lazy freeloaders. —Investigation Consultant Leazov

++ Alexylva University

A world-renowned university located in the suburbs of Glasgow, Scotland. QS Top 100.

++ Miskatonic University

A mediocre university located in Massachusetts. Founded in 1690, it is located in the town of Arkham, a town with beautiful scenery and people.

++ Society of the Frontiers of Science

A spin-off of the SCP Foundation, dedicated to the study of anomalous phenomena. It hopes to explain all anomalous phenomena from a purely materialistic point of view.


++ UIU, 19th Bureau, GRU-P (Defunct) and Other Goverment Agencies

These government agencies still exist, but they have been reduced to the size of an office.

The organization in this canon hub that corresponds to the 19th Bureau in the baseline universe is the National Office of Anomalous Affairs, or Office XIX for short.



[[/tab]]

[[tab Writing]]

+ Why is it called &#34;Demarcators of the Frontiers&#34;?

&#34;Demarcators of the Frontiers&#34; means &#34;those who redefine our cognitive frontiers&#34;. Members of the Foundation walk the cognitive frontiers with the duty to refresh them.



+ What is missing in this world?

Many things. The Veil, the anomalous technologies, the resources and influence the Foundation prides itself on, the great desire to protect humanity.


+ What is the world like? How does the SCP Foundation work?

This is a world with few anomalies. This world is built on the model of our real world, and it no longer has a clear veil. The so-called anomalies are also scattered in small cults and various psychics. Systematic large GoIs do not exist. All anomalies are **episodic**.

In this world, there are no more world-destroying anomalies, only those lurid urban legends and remote villages with unknown secrets.

And the SCP Foundation? It has become a small **academic organization** that also acts as a consultant. Part-time investigators travel around, searching for the truth behind the urban legends of the desolate streets in the early hours of the morning, probing the dark spaces deep within the ancient cities drowned in yellow sand. Most of the time they return without success, but there are times when these investigators find certain tokens belonging to Nyarlathotep - sorry for the crossover. As for containment? What the SCP Foundation can do is advise the governments as much as possible to reduce the casualties in containment operations, record enough anomalies to draw patterns for the relevant government agencies to reference and control, and (if possible) participate in subsequent research. They are happy to do this.

The Foundation here has no ability to contain anomalies, no decent military force, and is more like a bunch of old scholars risking their lives.


+ Foundation-Government Relations

The Foundation is a **public** academic research organization that also has an advisory function. This means that even the general public is aware of its existence. Governments also ask the Foundation for help in dealing with supernatural issues. Most of the time, however, these matters are handled by the national government agencies themselves.

+ TL;DR

SCP Foundation = Miskatonic University

Anomalies are weakened, most are difficult to explain, and if you run into them, you will die.

Investigators are similar to those in the Cthulhu Mythos.

That&#39;s all.


+ Where is the Veil?

The Veil does not exist in this world because there is no obvious paranormal world. This world is based on our real world. I&#39;m sure your short videos aren&#39;t filled with all kinds of supernatural events all day long, right? Mostly there are videos like &#34;Top 10 Mysterious Creatures&#34;.

So there is no veil in this world. Those who believe in such legends believe, and those who don&#39;t turn a blind eye. Why bother your head about such things when you only found one related video after watching over 2,000 videos?

Besides, even if you saw something indescribable, would you really want to talk to your friends about it?


+ What about anomalous technologies?

**The answer is no**. Forget about reality anchors and other fancy weapons. The only weapons available to the Foundation in this world are the ones you can get in reality, and the technology level is set for the 21st century. So don&#39;t think about superpowers.

+ What about the Foundation&#39;s ability to fight?

Although there are some veterans in the Foundation, their fighting ability is still not comparable to that of a professional army. Foundation members in this world are scientific researchers and investigative journalists, not gun-toting hotheads. Most of the time they just use their cell phones or cameras to record what they see and hear. It is much better to leave these things to the professionals. Yes, Foundation members in this world will undoubtedly call the police in some extreme situations.

However, if your character is trapped in a story like //Alan Wake// or //SIREN//, they will undoubtedly try to find a way out. But while characters like Hu Bayi (protagonist of //Gui Chui Deng//) or Wu Xie (protagonist of //Daomu Biji//) are allowed, we don&#39;t want you to create a Mary Sue. Your characters should live up to their character settings.

Let&#39;s take an example. Suppose your character is a journalist who infiltrates a cult village to carry out his activities. As a journalist, he sneaks around and investigates, uses interrogation to get important information, and may have excellent physical strength. However, he may not be able to use weapons such as firearms or bows and arrows, and he may not be able to fight back and forth with the ex-soldiers in the village.

As for X-Men, forget about it.


+ To sum up, what can I write about? (To be added)

Lovecraftian horror.
