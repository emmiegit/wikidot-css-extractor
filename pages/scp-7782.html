**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7782 is kept in a specialized anomalous storage locker that prevents rotting.

**Description:** SCP-7782 is a sapient //gala// apple capable of speech. The method by which it speaks is unknown.

**Discovery:** On February 14th 2023, SCP-7782 spontaneously manifested on Doctor Yellowstone&#39;s desk alongside a valentines day card with the text &#34;You are the apple of my eye!&#34; The following interaction was recorded by security cameras in Doctor Yellowstone&#39;s office.
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7782:** Hey there, doc. Some might bake you into an apple pie, but I&#39;d bake you into a cutie pie.
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Yellowstone:** Oh, hello. Thank you, I guess. How did you get in here?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7782:** I fell from the tree right into your basket[[footnote]]There are no trees nor baskets in Doctor Yellowstone&#39;s office.[[/footnote]]. Speaking of which, if I saw you on a tree, I&#39;d climb to the top just to pick you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor Yellowstone:** I&#39;m flattered, but no thank you. Have you heard of the Smith-Malus anomalous scientific law? It states that &#34;an apple a day keeps the doctor away.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7782:** Dang. Well, it was nice to meet you anyways!
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Addendum 1:** As of July 17th 2023, SCP-7782 has made romantic advances towards fifty-three Foundation Personnel, twenty-two sapient SCP objects, and one picture of a potted plant. None of these individuals have reciprocated SCP-7782&#39;s advances, and it has not made advances towards individuals who have declined previously. Researcher Wadsworth offered to introduce it to one of the Foundation&#39;s artificial intelligences. However, SCP-7782 declined, as the artificial intelligences do not run on Apple-branded computers.

**Addendum 2:** To test how SCP-7782 interacts with mundane objects, a non-anomalous //red delicious// apple was placed in its containment locker. The following was recorded after.
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**SCP-7782:** Hey, Wadsworth. Who&#39;s that?

**Researcher Wadsworth:** That&#39;s an apple[[footnote]]SCP-7782 has not seen any other apples since its original manifestation.[[/footnote]].

**SCP-7782:** She&#39;s the most beautiful girl I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;m gonna go talk to her.

//SCP-7782 rolls closer to the apple.//

**SCP-7782:** Uh, hi. I&#39;m Johnny.

//The apple is silent.//

**SCP-7782:** I, um, just wanted to say I think you&#39;re beautiful.

//The apple remains silent.//

**SCP-7782:** Do you want to get to know each other?

//The apple continues being silent.//

**&lt;End Log&gt;**
[[/div]]
The mundane apple remained in SCP-7782&#39;s containment locker at its request, and it continued to talk to the mundane apple despite the fact that the mundane apple has yet to verbally respond.

**Addendum 3:** Two engagement rings were found embedded in SCP-7782 and the mundane apple a year following Addendum 2. Nine months after the previous event, an apple seed with a tiny pacifier was found in SCP-7782&#39;s containment locker.
