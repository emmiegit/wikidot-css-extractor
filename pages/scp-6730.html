**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-6730-related species are to be contained within the vicinity of Site-44, situated on Foulness Island in Essex, England. Given the deep-sea nature of SCP-6730 entities, constructing on-site housing at the necessary scale for all captive instances is infeasible. Only temporary housing for select instances of each species is permitted in Unit 2 of Site-44&#39;s Subterranean Housing complex, designated for limited experimentation or observation.

A specified section of the southern North Sea, proximate to Site-44, has been publicly designated as off-limits under the guise of &#34;Ministry of Defence&#34; sea property. The demarcated sea region serves as an essential containment buffer, providing a natural environment for SCP-6730 instances without causing harm or distress to civilian populations. Enforcement measures for restricted access include appropriate signage and deterrent measures implemented to dissuade any attempts to breach the area. Integrated surveillance systems, both terrestrial and aquatic, monitor and respond to any unauthorized activities within the specified boundary. 

In instances where SCP-6730-related species breach this designated boundary and cannot be safely returned, termination procedures are to be executed if possible. Alternatively, misinformation campaigns are to be promptly initiated if instances are publicly discovered, ensuring any disclosed information remains speculative.

**Description:** SCP-6730 serves as the collective designation for a set of five initially unknown deep-sea aquatic life forms. These entities were initially documented between 1932 and 1934 by the American naturalist Dr. Charles William Beebe during a series of deep-sea &#34;Bathysphere&#34; dives conducted in collaboration with Otis Barton. Despite each species within SCP-6730 being assigned an individual designation, Beebe introduced a unifying term in his 1934 book, //&#34;Half Mile Down,&#34;// where he collectively referred to this series of, at the time, unidentified species as the &#34;untouchable.&#34;

All instances sharing the SCP-6730 designation were documented and recorded by Dr. William Charles Beebe during his November 22, 1932 expedition or the subsequent one on August 11, 1934. The Foundation&#39;s Cryptozoology Division developed early interest after Dr. Beebe described unidentified aquatic life deep in the Atlantic Ocean. Personnel were dispatched in 1933, a year after his initial dives, to capture the presumed sea life. Following successful captures during these early missions, a dedicated facility was established to study SCP-6730-related species. Subterranean Sector 2 Safe Storage at Research and Containment Site-44 on Foulness Island in Essex, England, became the designated containment site for captive instances. 

The specific reasons for the concentration of anomalous aquatic life in this region remain unclear. Furthermore, the absence of reported instances beyond Dr. Beebe&#39;s last expedition in 1934 is not fully understood. Retroactive observations of the dive sites revealed no further unidentifiable sea life. It is plausible that the Foundation&#39;s interventions, combined with the properties of each species, resulted in a dynamic equilibrium, prompting the majority of SCP-6730 entities to withdraw or enter a state of dormancy. SCP-6730-4 stands as the singular exception, possessing attributes that render it resistant to the observed disappearance of the other species in question.

**Name:** Charles William Beebe

**Status:** [[span style=&#34;background-color:orange&#34;]]Deceased as of June 4, 1962[[/span]]

**Pertinence:** Born on July 29, 1877, in Brooklyn, New York, Charles William Beebe emerged as a pioneering naturalist, ornithologist, and marine biologist of great fame.

Noted for his extensive expeditions, such as those to the Galápagos Islands, Trinidad, and Venezuela, led to the discovery and cataloging of numerous avian species previously unknown. Dr. Beebe&#39;s work was nothing short of high-praise, and his popularity later caught the attention of inventor Otis Barton [[span style=&#34;background-color:orange&#34;]](Then designated as PoI-6730-2)[[/span]] as early as 1928. Dr. Beebe conducted a series of historic deep-sea dives with Barton, notably in the &#34;Bathysphere,&#34; a submersible designed for exploring the ocean via a tether cable. Two of these series of dives would catch the interest of the SCP Foundation, first in 1932, where Dr. Beebe [[span style=&#34;background-color:orange&#34;]]first documented an instance of SCP-6730-1, SCP-6730-2, and SCP-6730-3[[/span]]. In 1934 he once again was able to establish the [[span style=&#34;background-color:orange&#34;]]first recorded sighting of SCP-6730-4 and SCP-6730-5[[/span]].

After 1934, he would not attend anymore deep-sea expeditions, as a falling-out between he and Barton had soured relations. Furthermore, the economic strain brought on by the Great Depression of the time had made securing any future funds nigh-impossible during the global economic strain. 

Dr. Beebe would away on June 4, 1962, succumbing to natural causes. [[span style=&#34;background-color:orange&#34;]]He never held any direct association with the SCP Foundation.[[/span]]

**Name:** Frederick Otis Barton Jr.

**Status:** [[span style=&#34;background-color:orange&#34;]]Deceased as of April 15, 1992[[/span]]

**Pertinence:** Otis Barton was born on June 5, 1899, in New York City. Generally, information on his early life is scarce, however it can be determined that he at least held a general interest towards engineering.

In 1928, he begun plans and funding towards a deep-sea diving capsule which was designed for famed American naturalist William Beebe [[span style=&#34;background-color:orange&#34;]](Then designated as PoI-6730-1)[[/span]] to be submerged in. Construction finished by at least 1930, when the duo first met and thus conducted the first test dives. Beebe dubbed the device the &#34;Bathysphere&#34; which derived itself from the Greek words &#34;bathos,&#34; meaning &#34;depth,&#34; and &#34;sphere&#34; meaning.. well, sphere. Nonetheless, it was in Barton&#39;s invention which Beebe would document the first initial instances of SCP-6730. Barton&#39;s adeptness in designing diving bells, however, [[span style=&#34;background-color:orange&#34;]]caught the attention of personnel at Research and Containment Site-44[[/span]], who recognized the potential for his expertise in aiding the capture and comprehensive study of SCP-6730-related species. 

Following the establishment of a permanent aquatic branch at Site-44 in 1936, Barton entered into a contractual agreement under the guise of the front company &#34;Schmidt and Corper Plating.&#34; This arrangement secured additional funding for Barton to design his diving bells. These newly new devices, upon completion, were deployed into submerged sections of Site-44&#39;s aquatic branch, which allowed for deep-sea observation of the captive SCP-6730 instances.

He would pass away due to natural causes on April 14, 1992. As a contractor working directly under the Marine Cryptozoology branch at Site-44, he was only [[span style=&#34;background-color:orange&#34;]]granted access to the aquatic sector of safe storage during routine test dives for observation purposes[[/span]].

]]
**Morphological Description:** SCP-6730-1, often referred to by the unofficial taxonomy of &#34;Bathysphaera intacta,&#34; derived from &#34;Bathysphere,&#34; the early deep-sea vessel used during the first documented recording of a SCP-6730-1 instance, and &#34;intacta&#34; Latin for &#34;untouchable,&#34; is a species of aquatic life that was first observed during a initial set of experimental underwater dives in early 1932. The first instances were recorded alongside two other previously unidentified species, that currently being SCP-6730-2 as well as SCP-6730-3.

The overall exterior physical appearance of species that are designated under the SCP-6730-1 classification mirror the common genus of Idiacanthus, which represents a family of dragonfishes which are frequent in the Atlantic Ocean. Nonetheless, immediate observations allow for the distinction between sea life belonging under the Idiacanthus genus, as even if similar in physical appearance, the SCP-6730-1 species have notable exterior features which are commonly accepted to be natural evolutions as a way to counter the lack of light deep beneath the ocean. Therefore, a set of enlarged photophores adorn both sides of the species, and if active, emit a near infrared light, thus appearing dim to the human eye. Famously, instances of SCP-6730-1 are noted for their large eyes, which are disproportionate even for a creature of it&#39;s great size, being paired with a frontal and rear pair of down-protruding stalks which have natural &#34;bulbs&#34; of photophores on their tips.

All current properties that are believed to be anomalous in-nature with regards to the species of SCP-6730-1 have been entirely related to the way that the species is able to seemingly harness and gain energy from electromagnetic waves of conduction which flow through large bodies of water, such as oceans. Much to the same way of how a common fish is able to use their gills to have water perforate their bodies and thus hydrate the animal, instances of SCP-6730-1 are able to collect energy from the small amounts of electricity generated in certain molecules of ocean water. It is uncertain on if this is a natural bodily process within the species, or if SCP-6730-1 instances are able to control their electric-intake through means that are entirely non-physical.

-----

**Discovery:** The first instances of SCP-6730-1 were described by Dr. Charles William Beebe on his November 22, 1932 descent in the &#34;Bathysphere&#34; early diving vessel. During the descent off of the Bermuda coast, at nearly 2,100 feet (about 640 meters) further descent into the ocean was briefly halted, as Dr. Beebe had believed that he spotted a pair of large aquatic animals not far from the porthole-style window of the vessel. Therefore, he had enough time to secure the vessel&#39;s internal spotlight and aim it out of a secondary window, which had revealed the first pair of documented SCP-6730-1 instances. He had viewed what he called &#34;two creatures both six-feet in length&#34; swim completely around the diving bell, and although some rough notes were made about the unusual appearance of the unknown species, the pair of SCP-6730-1 instances would apparently swim off into the further abyss, rendering further visualization of the initial species impossible.

Upon returning to the surface from the descent, Dr. Beebe documented the three species that he had apparently seen below the surface of the water, that being not only the two instances of SCP-6730-1, but as well as SCP-6730-2 and SCP-6730-3, all seen at different depths respectively. The early accounts from the incident had garnered interest from the Foundation&#39;s Cryptozoology Division, which since the encounter, been wanting to confirm the validity of the purportedly seen creatures. Nonetheless, it would not be until 1933 that personnel tasked with identifying the reported instances would be able to replicate the dive which saw the first documentation of the SCP-6730 series of creatures. After routine test dives, Foundation personnel were able to retrieve samples of the first three identified species, temporarily boarding them onto a disguised cargo ship which itself was bound for Site-44, the hub of the Foundation&#39;s Cryptozoology Division which is located on Foulness Island in Essex, England.

Following the first retrieval of the species designated as SCP-6730-1 in 1933, an early analysis including a dissection made upon one of the instances aboard the vessel used for transportation to Site-44 had erroneously concluded that there was absolutely nothing anomalous in-nature about the recovered instances. It was assumed that SCP-6730-1, as well as the other captured species that being SCP-6730-2 and SCP-6730-3 might be nothing more then what the mainstream scientific notion was at the time, that the described sea creatures were just previously unidentified species that had evolved from a common ancestor to whichever genus they appeared most in-tune with. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that it is possible that no anomalous properties revealed themselves during this early dissection period as the sample in-question had not been alive, nor was it underwater, dismissing the chance to observe the species utilize their electromagnetic synthesis.

Personnel originally entrusted with the initial retrieval of SCP-6730-1 instances were directed to release any living organisms of the species back into the sea, opting for the closest expansive saltwater body near the North Sea. Due to this, SCP-6730-1 entities would remain in an uncontained state until 1934. It would not be until  1934 where a newfound interest after observing the other documented species, that being SCP-6730-2 and SCP-6730-3, that it was realized that the remaining surviving captive instances of the species should be re-examined. Efforts to recontain the recently freed SCP-6730-1 instances were initiated, amassing in a process that would last nearly two years, until finally concluding in 1936.

**Ethological Analysis:** As common with most deep-sea aquatic life, the species belonging to the SCP-6730-1 designation employ a few adaptations in-order to better suit their environment. Being a natural predator, SCP-6730-1 can harness enough conduct oceanic electric currents carried in waves to produce a near-infrared emission which is meant to attract potential prey. However, it should be noted that unlike other sea creatures that produce light naturally such as Lophius piscatorius, known as the common Anglerfish, instances of SCP-6730-1 only produce such emissions when in a situation that desires such. Routine observations have shown that the species is capable of navigating the otherwise entirely darkened bodies of water as if they could see through the darkness. It is entirely plausible that the enlarged eyes of SCP-6730-1 instances are of such size on purpose, and without a doubt, play a role in this ability. 

Sourcing prey in the deep regions of the sea is rather obviously more uncommon then at other levels that are closer to the surface. Due to this, and once again, a naturally occurring theme for creatures that inhabit the lower levels of the ocean, their diets consume mostly of free-floating fish scales, fecal matter, and species which fall under the crustacean shrimp genus. As per most sea animals, the species does have the ability to &#34;rest&#34; by reducing their overall activity, but do not have the common tradition of land mammals that results in sleeping. The species presumably is kept energized by swimming, as they are undoubtedly crossing through currents which contain electric conductivity. This process is much alike normal fish species, which by swimming, allows them to stay hydrated as fresh water flows through their gills.

During the reproduction cycle for the species, a strategy wherein males possess specialized organs known as photophores, will emit bioluminescent signals which serve as a way to attract and potentially court a mate. Upon encountering a receptive female instance, the male instance approaches and transfers sperm packets, known as spermatophores, to the female&#39;s specialized pouch. This pouch, located near the cloaca, functions as a receptacle for the spermatophores, allowing the female to control the timing of fertilization. After copulation, the female can choose when to release the sperm and initiate the fertilization process.

**Morphological Description:** SCP-6730-2, commonly referred to by the suggested taxonomy of &#34;Bathyceratias trilynchus,&#34; is a previously unidentified deep-sea aquatic species, first documented during the secondary array of deep-sea descents in the early months of 1932 off the shores of Bermuda. SCP-6730-2, as designation suggests, was one of the first described SCP-6730 related instances, recorded alongside SCP-6730-1 and SCP-6730-3.

The appearance of species which are identified to fall under the SCP-6730-2 designation have the general exterior look akin to either the Ceratiidae family of fish, commonly known as &#34;seadevils,&#34; or the related Thaumatichthyidae family of anglerfish, referred to as &#34;wolf-trap anglers&#34; due to their physical appearance. However, the species classified as SCP-6730-2, as of now, has yet to been linked by a common ancestor to other genera of deep-sea life. Despite bearing a great resemblance to Cryptopsaras, the &#34;triplewart&#34; seadevil, the species in-question lacks any dorsal fins, and have three illicia which protrude upwards out of the top of the fish, which emit a yellow glow. It is uncertain to why instances of SCP-6730-2 presumably evolved, or developed to have no stabilizing dorsal fins, or how the species can properly stabilize their own bodies and traverse through large bodies of water with such ease.

Currently, all observed anomalous properties of the species belonging under the designation of SCP-6730-2 have been nonphysical. It has been observed that, when encountered with minor sea life that are classified as prey, instances of SCP-6730-2 have been able to paralyze the given prey through means uncertain. It was this function that was observed in nearly all cases of when an instance of SCP-6730-2 went to look for food, that they would be able to cripple and eliminate their prey without making physical contact. Furthermore, it is uncertain if this effect of paralyzing their prey can work on other non-sea animals, or humans, as it has been widely unethical and in some cases, impossible due to the depth that the creatures live at, to have a readily-available means of experimenting with this property.

-----

**Discovery:** The first recorded instances of SCP-6730-2 were documented on November 22, 1932, by Dr. Charles William Beebe. Whilst on an experimental diving vessel known as the &#34;Bathysphere,&#34; at a depth of about 2,470 feet (about 752 meters), he had viewed a small school of these fish in the distance of the dark ocean depths. Due to the species never coming close enough to a porthole window on the Bathysphere, Dr. Beebe had been unable to provide a long, or very descriptive inquiry about the unknown species. Nonetheless, he was able to pen down their rough details, but it wouldn&#39;t be until Foundation intervention that the creatures could undergo proper inspection.

Although the Foundation&#39;s Cryptozoology Division was well aware of a series of potentially new sea life deep beneath the Atlantic Ocean as early as Dr. Beebe&#39;s first accounts in 1932, direct intervention would not originally occur until roughly a year after in 1933. Personnel tasked with managing the investigation had finally concurred enough of a basis to secure the proper resources needed in-order to replicate the experimental deep-sea dives that had first been responsible for early documentation of SCP-6730-2. Early dives on the behalf of the Foundation would occur in the same vicinity as the original descents had, and would indeed confirm Dr. Beebe&#39;s findings, and several instances of SCP-6730-2, as well as SCP-6730-1 and SCP-6730-3 would be resurfaced during separate dive efforts spanning the year. Instances of all previous designations would be temporarily housed on a Foundation-operated vessel, disguised as a cargo ship.

Early investigations on SCP-6730-2 had yielded no notable anomalous properties, or physical oddities. Whilst SCP-6730-2 did have external features that were similar, but did not yet match other aquatic life at the time, it could easily be placed under the assumption of a undiscovered deep-sea species. It would not be until later observations would deduce that SCP-67300-2 instances had the ability to cripple their prey through non-physical means that these uncertain possibilities were considered. Further testing of this ability proved that other sea creatures, even large natural predators such as the Architeuthis family of giant squids were suspectable to being paralyzed by the species belonging to SCP-6730-2.

**Ethological Analysis:** The behavior of SCP-6730-2 is absolutely predatory in nature, being the most violent of the five total species belonging to the SCP-6730 series of designations. Observations have shown that the life cycle of a SCP-6730-2 instance only revolves around the themes of being able to consume food to live, and finding a mate for reproduction. The average recorded lifespan of SCP-6730-2 instances thus far is only two and a half years for male specimens, and up to five total years for females. This is a stark contrast to species that SCP-6730-2 instances are similar to, as for example the common anglerfish order that being Lophiiformes typically range upwards for twenty-five to thirty years depending on environmental factors, as well as the sex of the animal. It is unclear why the SCP-6730-2 species have drastically shorter lifespans then most aquatic life, however a possible theory is the great speed of their metabolism could be a factor, further explaining why the creatures are so predatory in nature.

The diet of the SCP-6730-2 species has no particular range, as limited testing has prevailed no certain patterns in what instances of SCP-6730-2 consume. Observations have made it clear that the species will attempt to eat any item, regardless if it is alive or inanimate. The feeding period also generally has no guided direction, as the instances regularly consume prey throughout their lives, regardless if it rapid-succession or periods that extend upwards of hours.

Rather than engaging in traditional forms of sexual reproduction, the species employ a strategy characterized by parasitism. In this process, two smaller male instances of SCP-6730-2 act as parasites, latching onto a larger female instance. The two smaller males, known as parasitic mates, establish a symbiotic relationship with the female, fusing with her circulatory system and essentially becoming parasitic extensions of it&#39;s body. This fusion allows the female to provide sustenance to the parasitic mates and, in turn, facilitates their reproductive function. The parasitic mates, once attached, undergo significant physiological changes, losing many of their independent characteristics and becoming reliant on the female for essential nutrients. This parasitic bond between the trio of afflicted specimens ensures a constant source of sperm for the female instance, allowing for continuous reproduction.

**Morphological Description** SCP-6730-3, colloquially known by the unofficial genus of &#34;Bathysphereon elysium,&#34; with &#34;Bathysphereon&#34; being derived from the early diving bell known as the &#34;Bathysphere&#34; which allowed for the first documentation of the species, and &#34;elysium&#34; coming from the Greek word used to describe a sort of &#34;underworld,&#34; was the third of the first three previously unidentified deep-sea aquatic creatures that were observed off the coast of Bermuda during an early series of experimental dives in 1932. The other specimens that were identified alongside SCP-6730-3 were SCP-6730-1, as well as SCP-6730-2.

The general exterior appearance of SCP-6730-3 has been allocated to that of the the genus of Belonidae, better known as the family of needlefish, or the Lepisosteidae family of Garfish. Nonetheless, it is of note that these are only rough comparisons, as the species that is SCP-6730-3 do not genuinely appear to be closely related, or linked by a common ancestor. Furthermore, it is the species of SCP-6730-3 instances that were found last in the original series of 1932 dives, as observations have revealed that they typically only inhabit the deeper ranges of the ocean, and the genera of fish presented above are not entirely capable of survival in such depths.

Properties pertaining to SCP-6730-3 that have been noted to not be of natural occurrence also appear to be direct methods of survival adaptations, or at least play a key role in the survival of the species. The external layer of SCP-6730-3 is completely scaleless, and instead the species is only protected by a thin layer of skin. The skin in-question has been observed to interchangeably &#34;mix&#34; with patterns and intervals of glaring colors, boasting surprising reflectivity. It is uncertain how the skin of SCP-6730-3 is able to perform such opportunities, especially when paired with the observation of SCP-6730-3, as when not directly exposed to an outside source of light, the recorded instances will appear competently unseen with the darkness of the deep ocean due to a general lack of sunrays that can penetrate the dense layers of water. Furthermore, it is odd for this ability to be present when coupled with the damaging aspect of the species, assumed to be some sort of defensive mechanism, as viewing the bright reflections and colors on the skin layer of SCP-6730-3 can cause strain on the retina, as it is believed that the epidermis is emitting ultraviolet rays which can burn the tissue of the eye, not to dissimilar from the effect of staring at a bright object.

Furthermore, it was originally believed that SCP-6730-3 had no internal skeleton due to the notable process of adjustment in-which instances of SCP-6730-3 are able to elongate themselves, and morph into positions or overall proportions which had not been prior recorded on any other living organism. Due to this, the assumption was a chondrichthyan, similar to how the Psychrolutes marcidus, commonly known as the Blobfish, can depress itself and be shaped by the ocean around them due to being cartilaginous. It would only be until later dissection of captive instances of SCP-6730-3 that it was determined that the species did contain a solid internal skeleton, which put the ability to seemingly morph and stretch impossible to do naturally.

-----

**Discovery:** The original documentation, and thus the first known in-relation to SCP-6730-3 was on November 22, 1932, by Dr. Charles William Beebe whilst submerged aboard the &#34;Bathysphere,&#34; which was an early diving bell. After the observation of SCP-6730-2 at the paused interval of 2,470 feet (roughly 752 meters), the descent would resume for another period of unspecified time until the vessel reached a total depth of slightly over 2,500 feet (762 meters). At this depth, Dr. Beebe had once again activated the internal spotlight and aimed it out of a porthole window, revealing that the vessel they were in was located in a school of an uncountable amount of SCP-6730-3 instances, which were not able to be seen without the spotlight enabled. Dr. Beebe had recounted that the species was of an uncertain genus, and although appeared to be that of a common Gar, he was certain that they could have not been related. He had also made the claim of, whilst observing the fish, they appeared to distort their shape, however he was uncertain if it was the fish itself, or a naturally occurring illusion caused by the fused-quartz window, or the ocean currents.

After further dives were halted in late 1932, the Foundation Cryptozoology division, who had been following the reports of the encounters with the series of potentially undiscovered sea life, had begun an investigation aiming at recovery of the three documented species, that being SCP-6730-1, SCP-6730-2, and of SCP-6730-3. Ultimately, the efforts to retrieve the initial first samples of the species into Foundation captivity were successful, and there would be temporarily held on a cargo vessel aimed at being transported back to the Cryptozoology division&#39;s main hub, located at Site-44 on Foulness Island in Essex, England. It was during these initial retrievals of SCP-6730-3 instances that personnel would receive levels of minor eye damage whilst attempting to recover the species, as although previous documentation had stated the creatures would be bright, the true effect of how capable the instances were of this was not made clear until later observations.

**Ethological Analysis:** SCP-6730-3 is one of the three natural prey in the species series which share the SCP-6730 series of designations, the other instances being SCP-6730-4 and SCP-6730-5. Nonetheless, the species still has developed a series of ways to, at the very least, ward off potential predator wildlife beneath the ocean. As the outermost layer of skin, or the epidermis, of SCP-6730-3 is ultraviolet in nature, and can cause at damage to the retina and cornea of the eyeball. Therefore, despite being small and rather passive compared to most sea life, it would be exceedingly difficult for a predatory underwater species to effectively terminate an instance of SCP-6730-3 due to the extreme brightness of it&#39;s outer skin layer. It has been observed through protective lenses that SCP-6730-3 often unwillingly can blind sea life around it&#39;s body, which has been made apparent from the many observations which lead unassuming predators to convulse after having their retinas visibly burn. 

Any attempts from natural predators to consume instances of SCP-6730-3 have also been met with considerable challenge. In the observed times that an instance of SCP-6730-3 had an attempt to be eaten by a predator, the instance of SCP-6730-3 would effectively counter any attempts to devour it by rapidly changing it&#39;s mass, either elongating or shrinking, or taking up a shape which is utterly uncomfortable for the predator. It is as of now undeterminable how the species known as SCP-6730-3 are able to understand the defensive nature of being able to morph their bodies, or how they precisely know which rough shapes to occupy during a predatory attack.

Unlike non-anomalous aquatic species, SCP-6730-3 exhibits the ability to undergo a form of asexual reproduction similar to that of parthenogenesis. This reproductive strategy enables a lone instance of SCP-6730-3 to produce viable offspring without the involvement of a mate. During periods conducive to reproduction, an instance of SCP-6730-3 will initiate a specialized physiological process where unfertilized eggs undergo activation and development. This parthenogenesis allows the eggs to mature into fully formed juvenile instances, and are typically alive in the birthing instance until the eventual natural release. This has been observed as an adaptation to the surroundings of the deep-sea, as there are typically a lack of nesting areas.

**Morphological Description:** SCP-6730-4, commonly known by the proposed taxonomy of &#34;Bathyembryx istiophasma,&#34; with &#34;Bathyembrx&#34; being derived from the early diving bell first used to observe the species, itself known as the &#34;Bathysphere,&#34; and &#34;istiophasma&#34; being a combination of the Greek word &#34;istio&#34; relating to skin, and the Latin word of &#34;phasma&#34; meaning specter, or ghastly, is a previously unidentified species first documented during a routine set of deep-sea dives off of the coast of Bermuda in 1934. The first instances of SCP-6730-4 observed were not recorded at the time of when the species belonging to SCP-6730-1, SCP-6730-2, and SCP-6730-3 were observed during 1932, instead the instances of SCP-6730-4 would be observed on the same day as when the species classified under the SCP-6730-5 designation would be documented for the first time as well.

The species belonging to the SCP-6730-5 classification does not seem to roughly match any known or documented genus or family of sea life on record, a which itself is a theme not to uncommon with the rest of the series that share a SCP-6730 designation. Upon first documentation by Dr. Charles William Beebe in 1934, he had assumed that the species could have been related to the Cetomimidae genus, which dependent on sex, are usually referred to as &#34;whalefish&#34; in-regards to a female, or bignose fishes&#34; for male specimen. However, fish that are under this family of sea life exhibit immense sexual dimorphism, a theme that is not present with recorded instances of SCP-6730-4, coming to the assumption that the species is entirely asexual, or lacking any distinction between two sexes.

It cannot be determined through observations if instances of SCP-6730-4 are natural prey, or predators. Despite the species exterior appearance being more akin to natural prey, the considerable size of fully matured instances cast doubt on this assumption. Furthermore, the anomalous prosperities exhibited by instances of SCP-6730-4 effectively render them unclassifiable on the natural order between prey and predators, as it has been recorded that the species exhibits a sort of &#34;blindness&#34; in-terms of rendering their surroundings. Due to this, the species seemingly pay no attention towards any potential obstacles or other aquatic life in their proximity, and when observed, even are able to glide through physical matter as if it were non-existent. To this point, it is entirely uncertain if SCP-6730-4 instances are even properly aware of their surroundings, or if they are able to comprehend the actions that regular sea life partake in, such as swimming, and using their gill system to breathe.

Due to the extreme difficulty in effectively capturing the species known as SCP-6730-4, they have been set to be uncontainable, and efforts to eliminate the species in a controlled manner have occurred in prior times. It is not known if it would be possible to use other non-physical methods to contain instances of SCP-6730-4, as tangible matter has not proved efficient due to their constant ability to seemingly phase through such objects. Furthermore, it should be noted that all observed instances of SCP-6730-4 are seemingly constantly in some sort of movement.

**Discovery:** Unlike the original three instances that are SCP-6730-1, SCP-6730-2, and SCP-6730-3, the previously unidentified species which has now been designated under the SCP-6730-4 classification was first documented two years after the former series, on August 11, 1934, once again by Dr. Beebe during a routine deep-sea dive using the early diving bell known as the Bathysphere. The species was the first of the last two previously unknown species to be documented, the other and final being SCP-6730-5 which was observed after the first instances of SCP-6730-4. Shortly after the descent in the diving bell had begun, the vessel would be halted at nearly 1,500 feet (about 457 meters), in-order to allow Dr. Beebe to observe a series of fish that he claimed to see when viewing outside one of the three porthole windows on the Bathysphere. He had briefly documented the species of being akin to a genus that he was uncertain of, and that the fish observed, whilst resembling common epipelagic zone species, were rather large for the depths that the species had been recorded at. Furthermore, he had properly observed the characteristic and documented that it appeared that the species he had seen were lacking in-terms of comprehension, and had wondered if the species were running off of motor-neuron functions.

Physical observations by the means of dissection, or even viewing the species in a stable or reliable environment has proved inefficient due to the capabilities of SCP-6730-4 instances, making it neigh-impossible to observe the species in a controlled session. This issue came apparent during the initial process of capturing the species in 1935, as personnel from the Foundation&#39;s Cryptozoology Division had been unaware that attempting to grasp or permanently store the species was infeasible. Therefore, no physical investigations on any instances of SCP-6730-4 have been possible. It was originally believed that personnel could terminate a specimen of the species and then resurface the carcass for studies, however, it was observed that upon death of the species, their physical matter rapidly break down and deteriorate.

**Ethological Analysis:** Since it is undeterminable if instances of the SCP-6730-4 species are supposed to be natural prey or predators, most, if not all, written documentation that has been currently observed come from visually interpreting the few instances of the species that have been recorded by Foundation personnel. Therefore, the adaptations that the species partake in cannot be determined if they are an immediate cause of some internal factor. Nonetheless, it can be noted that the species metaphysical abilities when it comes to the terms of solid, physical matter, are a remarkable instinct, as this property virtually renders all instances of SCP-6730-4 to be immune to outside predatory attacks from other sea life. Furthermore, it has previously been observed that when attacked by a sea predator, the specimens viewed had no reaction, as if they were unaware of the attack itself.

Consumption by SCP-6730-4 instances is a direct consequence of their front physical features, as what is believed to be their mouth is permanently ajar, allowing the species to simply swim in order to feed, similar  to other filter-feeding sea life. It should be noted that while instances of SCP-6730-4 are seemingly able to glide through solid matter unaffectable, the stray bits of feed that are consumed do not phase through the specimen.

SCP-6730-4&#39;s reproductive process commences when the entity, in its phasing state, encounters a suitable substrate, typically solid or semi-solid material. Upon finding an appropriate substrate, an instance of SCP-6730-4 undergoes a process resembling mitosis, wherein the entity undergoes self-division. Unlike typical mitotic processes observed in cellular reproduction, the SCP-6730-4 species division is metaphysical, involving the separation of its spectral essence rather than cellular structures. This metaphysical division results in the creation of two distinct instances of SCP-6730-4, each retaining the phasing ability and spectral characteristics of the original specimen.

**Morphological Description:** SCP-6730-5, typically referred to by the unofficial taxonomy of &#34;Bathysidus pentagrammus,&#39; with &#34;Bathysidus&#34; being derived from the word &#34;Bathysphere,&#34; which was the experimental diving bell that allowed for the first recorded documentation of the species, and &#34;pentagrammus&#34; as in reference to the &#34;five-lines&#34; of photophores that adorn the animal, is a once unidentified aquatic species which was documented alongside SCP-6730-4 off of the Bermuda coast in 1934. The species that belongs to the SCP-6730-5 designation was, currently still is, the last observed species that were recorded during deep-sea dives spanning from 1932 to 1934.

The exterior appearance of SCP-6730-5 does not immediately bring any stark comparisons to other known or documented genera that has been identified, although they share a rough similarity in shape to the Chaetodontidae group of sea life, which are commonly known as &#34;butterflyfish.&#34; Nonetheless, the species is unmistakably notable for being oblong, or &#34;disk&#34; shaped, which such proportions are not present on currently recorded aquatic creatures. Furthermore the lateral sides of the species are adorned with five rows of large photophores which warp around the overall skin of the fish, and emit a dim but yellow light, which themselves are completely encircled by a much smaller diameter of photophores which glare purple.

When viewing SCP-6730-5 in person, as the property described is not capturable via photography, or other means of capturing an image, the viewer will begin to feel an overwhelming and profound sense of emotional euphoria, similar if not exactly matched to the phenomenon known as Stendhal syndrome. All effects that are common to the phenomena are exhibited with viewing an instance of SCP-6730-5, with the viewer often making remarks of the profound beauty in the lights produced by the instance aloud. Typically, the observer will be broken of sight naturally, as the effecting instance will typically swim away if able to. However, severe cases observed in remote environments which did not allow a viewing subject to look away have consistently ended in an increase of blood pressure, typically leading to minor heart attacks or temporary loss of consciousness.

**Discovery** The first documented instance of the SCP-6730-5 species was on the same descant which had recorded and observed the first known instance of SCP-6730-4, on August 11, 1934, once again by Dr. Charles William Beebe. Whilst in the Bathysphere diving vessel, and after describing an series of SCP-6730-4 instances, the vessel would submerge itself to a total depth of 1,900 feet (about 579 meters). At this depth, Dr. Beebe had become engrossed with viewing outside of one of the Bathysphere&#39;s three fused-quartz porthole windows, as he was enamored with observing two instances of SCP-6730-5. Until the species inevitably swam off, he had recounted aloud about how they were seemingly the most beautiful creatures that he had ever seen, and that he would &#34;never forget&#34; his encounter. It is uncertain how long Dr. Beebe had been observing the species before they swam off into the darkness of the ocean, nonetheless, he quickly was able to write profound detailing of them, better than any of the other recorded SCP-6730related instances.

After the expedition beneath the Atlantic Ocean in 1934, the Foundation&#39;s Cryptozoology Division would once again be deployed to investigate and recover the purported newly found, unidentified sea creatures. Upon the realization that prior instances of SCP-6730-4 during the operation could not be successfully recovered due to properties of their own, (see SCP-6730-4 &#34;Bathyembryx&#34;) further efforts as to not waste resources were diverged into bringing the species of SCP-6730-5 instances into Foundation captivity. However, Dr. Beebe&#39;s original documentation of SCP-6730-5 did not garner enough concern for there to be any anomalous viewing effects on the creatures, which in-turn caused severe consequences towards the containment efforts. Most personnel, upon site of the instances, became too engrossed in observing the creatures to continue the captivity efforts, and had to be either forcefully removed from a line of vision towards the species, or in some cases, had to wait for the eventual time where the targeted instances would swim away and out of site. Nonetheless, containment efforts were able to lay capture to an assumed majority of the species in the original area of discovery, albeit the phenomena cast upon viewers tasked with the assignment of capture led to a lengthy period of time, concluding in 1936.

**Ethological Analysis:** The apparent abnormalities with the observed instances of SCP-6730-5 that cause the phycological effect similar to Stendhal syndrome have little to no effect on other sea life, rendering the effects of the SCP-6730-5 only potentially threatening to human observers. This also means that the species are natural prey in the wild, exhibiting typical behavior not too dissimilar to many other genera of standard aquatic life whom are docile in nature. Instances of SCP-6730-5 rarely feed, and certain more notable specimens of the species have gone upwards of one month before actively looking for potential feed. 

The initiation of the reproductive cycle is marked by the species ability to dynamically alter the color of its photophores across the observable color spectrum. This spectral display serves as a visual signal to attract potential mates within its deep-sea habitat. During the courtship phase, SCP-6730-5 instances engage in synchronized displays of vibrant and intricate light patterns, using their ability to generate a great array of light. The choice of colors and the complexity of the display are believed to convey information about the individual&#39;s genetic fitness and health, serving as a factor in mate selection. Once a suitable mate is attracted, the SCP-6730-5 pairs engage in a coordinated dance, intertwining their bioluminescent lines and creating a harmonious symphony of colors. The culmination of this courtship ritual leads to the release of  eggs and sperm by both individuals, initiating fertilization in a manner consistent with conventional marine species. The fertilized eggs undergo a developmental phase, and SCP-6730-5 offspring are eventually born.
