= **INTERNAL ZM &#34;WITCH SLAYER&#34; DIVISION CASEFILE DOCUMENTATION**

= **DO NOT DISSEMINATE**

------

**Case ID:** #03/12/2021-A (&#34;The Liberal Vampire&#34;)

**Case Status:** __ACTIVE__

**Assigned Personnel:** Agent Zieliński, Agent Mazurek

**Synopsis:** Refers to the chain of murders carried out between 03/12/2021 and 26/12/2021 on several high-standing Eastern European -- including Polish -- politicians and public figures.[[footnote]] **ARCHIVAL NOTICE:** Among the most notable victims stand Polish Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro and Polish far-right politician Janusz Korwin-Mikke; for the full list of all 19 victims, refer to document #03/12/2021-A-LOG-2. [[/footnote]] All recorded victims share the following similarities:
* the possession of a high-ranking status as a member of right-wing political parties, groups, or movements in Eastern Europe;
* a history of accusations of human rights violations and abuse of power;
* a history of accusations of silencing political enemies, especially outside the boundaries of law;
* a total and seemingly instantaneous removal of all blood from their organisms.

In all cases recorded, exsanguination has been deemed the cause of the victims&#39; deaths; their bodies are otherwise unviolated and show no signs of any manipulation or damage, magical or otherwise. Similarly, all victims were found dead within public spaces they had often frequented -- such as offices or chancelleries -- usually being reported dead only minutes after being seen in perfect health in public.

As of writing, no suspect has been identified. Recovered documents from international organizations similar in purpose to the Division operating in affected areas -- such as the [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-ua#DATSSU|Department of Abnormal Threats to the Security Service of Ukraine]]] or the [[[https://scpfoundation.net/scp-1390-ru|Federal Agency For the Supervision of the Abnormal]]] -- have similarly failed to identify any such person.

Each crime scene has been found devoid of physical evidence, save for the bodies themselves. Due to this, there exists no certainty that the person (or persons) responsible has stopped their actions, whatever their motivation may be -- It is therefore the Division&#39;s opinion that the murders are yet to cease and should be considered an ongoing case.

**History:** The first murder relating to the investigation was recorded on 03/12/2021 -- these activities have since continued in a sporadic and irregular manner and are yet to cease as of writing (26/12/2021). Under normal operational guidelines, the case would be classified under Alpha Proprity and immediately pursued further. However, due to the heightened staff requirements on account of the ongoing [[[hour-zero|Veilfall scenario]]], the Division is unable to supply additional personnel to this investigation.

Were it not for the fact that the murders affected Zbigniew Ziobro, a high-level supporter of the operations of the Ministry of Occult Phenomena and the Division, the case would be temporarily frozen. Due to this, only Agents Zieliński and Mazurek were cleared to continue the investigation

A copycat would actually copy though, wouldn&#39;t they. It&#39;s not like those corpses are beheaded. Same targets, but not the style. Or the actual reason Becker was even doing this in the first place.

Point is, whoever is doing this, it&#39;s a stunt, just like Becker. Meant to attract attention. If they really just wanted those people dead, ricin in the tea also does the job and is quieter. This -- this is intentional. Nobody leaves bodies like that in the open without wanting them to be seen.

**MAZUREK**
[[/hcell]]
[[cell class=&#34;active&#34;]]
Yes. Not much in that department. Some very faint EVE residual, but that could just as well be the bodies themselves generating it. If there was any magic involved, it couldn&#39;t have killed them.

**Addendum #03/12/2021-A-1:** Following the completion of Suspect #01/AB/83-ZP&#39;s interrogation, his memory of the events was properly dealt with, and he was released back into his house in Częstochowa. An appropriate explanation for his 7-hour disappearance was presented to him and his closest accomplices by Division personnel as per standard protocol.

Meanwhile, Agents Zieliński and Mazurek re-assessed the already available facts relating to #03/12/2021-A, with the added context for Zieliński&#39;s new ideas. Their research revealed that all of the victims of the murders did indeed share another common characteristic that had previously been overlooked -- all of them have been accused of, at some point in their lives, willingly approving behind-Veil laws or regulations that significantly infringed upon or limited the rights of Nälkä peoples within their countries.

**Name:** Unknown; colloquially referred to as &#34;The Old Witch&#34; or simply &#34;The Witch&#34; and &#34;The Sage&#34; by Divison personnel

[[div style=&#34;height: 14px&#34;]]

**Sex:** Unknown, if even applies

[[div style=&#34;height: 14px&#34;]]
[[/div]]

**Age:** Unknown

[[div style=&#34;height: 14px&#34;]]
[[/div]]

**Characteristics:** 328 cm in height. 785 kg in weight. Former human. Body augmented by Nälkä carnomancy to such a degree as to be virtually impossible to classify as &#34;humanoid.&#34; Resembles a grotesque creature of flesh full of limbs engraved with runes and several head-like constructs with long, silver hair and gouged-out eyes. Despite this, remains sentient and sapient and is fully capable of speech and logical thought. Half-fused with the building it resides in to such a degree that it is incapable of locomotion. Requires no sustenance to survive.

[[div style=&#34;height: 14px&#34;]]
[[/div]]

**Division History:** Subject was initially discovered during the Cold War-era OPERATION CHRISTBREAKER ventures into the Russian North for the purposes of recapturing Polish thaumic assets involved with proto-Nälkä societies and individuals residing within. Since discovery, has acted as a constant source of information relating to Nälkä history, culture, and practice to the Divison -- the only thing it wishes in return for its information is human contact for the purpose of conversation once in a week. Identified to have acted as an &#34;archive&#34; and guide to many proto-Nälkä peoples of the Russian North for numerous generations, including the societies eliminated by OPERATION CHRISTBREAKER.

[[div style=&#34;height: 14px&#34;]]
[[/div]]

**Important:** All personnel interacting with the subject are to imperatively uphold the illusion that the Division represents the interests of the Nälkä peoples and that it is staffed by followers of the doctrine; the subject has only agreed to cooperate with the Division under the pretense that the Division is a Nälkä group.

They then sorted them all from the most likely to the least likely to suffer such an attack, as dictated by their position and influence over the approval of the anti-Nälkä regulations.

Due to the scarcity of resources, Division Command advised that the Agents only attend to the most likely future victim in order to prevent the possible attempt on their life and / or identify the individual(s) responsible for the ongoing murders.

Respectable sirs and madams,

[[div style=&#34;height: 14px&#34;]]
[[/div]]

Forgive the time and my tone, but this is a matter of utmost urgency -- I&#39;m writing this right as I board a helicopter to HQ. I&#39;m running to you almost directly from a battlefield. (Zieliński is in appropriate hands. Hurt, but stable; he&#39;ll live). I do not know how much time we&#39;ve got to spare.

[[div style=&#34;height: 14px&#34;]]
[[/div]]

The confrontation with the #03/12/2021-A murderer was far from a success -- in the end, they got away, and it almost cost us the life of two Agents to try and stop it from happening. But it wasn&#39;t a total failure -- we heard their voice and their words. And we saw their //sigil// -- three entangled snakes, all surrounded by a single circle.

[[div style=&#34;height: 14px&#34;]]
[[/div]]

Their words, too, back up what I am about to propose. I may not personally know [[[old-adytite-language|Ämärangnä]]], but I&#39;d trust our local B/6 linguopath with my life. She says the words they spoke just after shooting Zieliński mean, and I quote: //&#34;Contact the others. Tell them I&#39;ve taken care of the [dogs / beasts] for now, but that they will soon return. We cannot take any more risks. Not until we are [done / finished / complete].&#34;//

[[div style=&#34;height: 14px&#34;]]
[[/div]]

I hope I do not need to tell you what a threat a re-emergent Klavigar Saarn poses.

[[div style=&#34;height: 14px&#34;]]
[[/div]]

What&#39;s even more worrying is that this isn&#39;t just an isolated incident; Supervision tells me they have unconfirmed reports about [[[sarkic-heat|a ten-meter horned warrior following Vanguard staff]]]. There&#39;s also been rumors of a many-handed figure being spotted around Prague and Alexandrian libraries. And while it would be a stretch to say from the intel we have gathered that what apparently lurks beneath the [[[scp-2191|Hoia Forest]]] is Lovataar, it would also be dishonest to call the two unrelated.

[[div style=&#34;height: 14px&#34;]]
[[/div]]

With all of this in mind, I must therefore ask: what the //hell// are the four Klavigars up to? What is so important that all four of them have seemingly only now decided to stop their millennia-old slumber, and reveal themselves to the world at large? 

[[div style=&#34;height: 14px&#34;]]
[[/div]]

And, most importantly of all, can we truly be sure it is //just// the [[[scp-6500|Impasse]]] that has caused this?
