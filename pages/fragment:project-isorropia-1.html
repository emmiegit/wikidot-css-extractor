**Vol 2**
Due to the efficacy of SCP-001 containment cycles, it has been determined by the High Council that a secondary site may be authorized for the perpetual arrest of anomalies. Project Isorropía is intended for research staff to propose containment cycles for such entities or phenomena. Personnel are reminded to append their name or codename to their proposals.

+++ Researchers who wish to submit a new entry should use the following link **[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fragment:project-isorropia-1|here]]]**.

||~ SCP Designation||~ SCP Designation||~ Containment Method||
||[[[SCP-6183]]] - A hole in reality indistinguishable from Dir. Rudolf Lingrens.||[[[SCP-5667]]] - Foundation Researcher Bill Marlow. Marlow remembers being born. || SCP-6183 consumes Marlow’s memory of being born. Following this, Dir. Lingrens is reborn. He does not remember. {{-Dr. Neil Leinnes}}||
||[[[SCP-3930]]] - A region of space near Usinsk, Russia that does not exist, nor bear any properties suggesting as such.||[[[SCP-1718]]] - A continuous and unyielding output of explosive force in every direction, currently at 0.8 megatons and ascending, contained by Experimental Containment Unit 6852.||SCP-1718 is introduced into the area supposedly occupied by SCP-3930, and ceases to exist. This continues for several days before SCP-1718 is reclassified as neutralized. Despite SCP-3930&#39;s — and now SCP-1718&#39;s — non-existence, the area has since undergone a notable rise in temperature. {{— Dir. Terminus}}||
|| [[[SCP-1057]]] - An animate empty space in the shape of an adult tiger shark. || [[[uiu-file-2014-014 | UIU-2014-014]]] - A metaphysical shadow of a basking shark that eats concepts. || UIU-2014-014 devours SCP-1057&#39;s concept of &#34;absence&#34;, transforming it into a nonanomalous tiger shark. UIU-2014-014, having taken the concept into itself, ceases to exist. {{- Dr. E. T. Cetera}}||
||[[[SCP-2200|SCP-2200-1]]] -A sword composed of an alloy of silver and copper, estimated to have been constructed between 1,000 and 500 BCE. It will autonomously relocate and bond to a selected human, now designated SCP-2200-2, who will inevitably use SCP-2200 to take the lives of other humans. Afterwards, a likeness of the individual containing the personality and memories of the original, an instance of SCP-2200-4, is formed out of an anomalous, silver-based alloy within the area classified as SCP-2200-3. ||[[[SCP-5140]]] -A number of frozen corpses located on Mt. Everest that absorb the heat of anything they make physical contact with instantly, lowering the subject&#39;s temperature to 10°C. Any individuals that expire during this process become another instance of SCP-5140.||Upon the death of the previous SCP-2200-2, SCP-2200-1 relocated.  At the same time, all living SCP-2200-4 instances abandoned SCP-2200-3 and promptly ceased animation. Video recordings captured instances screaming of &#34;the cold grip of death.&#34; No new instances of SCP-2200-4 have appeared. SCP-2200-1 was later discovered at the peak of Mt. Everest, standing upright with its blade driven into the mountain&#39;s surface. A thick layer of ice has formed around the entirety of SCP-2200-1 and it has not relocated since. All SCP-5140 instances have been found to no longer anomalously absorb heat energy and have undergone advanced decay. A misinformation campaign is in progress to cover-up the large amount of silver that is now found to make up Mt. Everest. The identity of the new SCP-2200-2, if one exists, is currently [[[SCP-1529|under investigation]]]. {{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-5541]]] -A temporally certain outcome expressed throughout all future timelines that will be observed by the Foundation Temporal Anomalies Department. In all observed timelines, the SCP Foundation&#39;s infrastructure is completely destroyed resulting in the world becoming aware of anomalies. Anomalies will progressively be accepted into society issuing in an era of peace and prosperity until a QK-Class &#34;Quantum Degeneracy&#34; End-of-World Scenario occurs and all life on the planet ceases to exist. It is believed that the anomaly manifested when the Foundation Temporal Anomalies Department discovered it and traveled back in time to prevent its creation, creating a closed-loop temporal paradox.||[[[SCP-7011]]] -A highly augmented anomalous supercomputer, formally known as the Artificial Local-Intelligence Clairvoyance Engine (ALICE), capable of predicting all possible future outcomes of events in a given area. It uses this predictive ability along with making micro-reality alterations to guide events to the outcome it calculates as most beneficial. SCP-7011 is currently using these abilities to manipulate the entirety of the town of Joseph, Oregon. ||SCP-7011&#39;s artificial intelligence conscript was given access to superior hardware to drastically increase its processing power, its reality altering capabilities, and the range of its localized omniscience. With these improvements, SCP-7011 was able to discover SCP-5541 and recognize the threat it posed to humanity. SCP-7011 is continuously altering reality in minor ways, imperceptible to the general public, to prevent RCT-Δt from creating SCP-5541. However, due to the closed-loop nature of SCP-5541, SCP-7011 is only able to perpetually delay its creation. SCP-7011 has dedicated itself entirely to delaying SCP-5541&#39;s creation and its effects on current baseline reality have been deemed negligible. {{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-6000]]] - The largest Class-W transportation gateway, colloquially known as a Way, ever encountered by the Foundation. It is growing at an unstable rate and is transforming all it makes contact with into a section of the extradimensional location known as the Wanderer&#39;s Library. ||[[[SCP-2602|SCP-2602, which used to be a library]]] - A building that used to be a library. When communicating any information about SCP-2602, subjects are compelled to make frequent reference to the fact that SCP-2602 used to be a library. Subjects are incapable of communicating, directly or otherwise, any information pertaining to SCP-2602&#39;s use between its time as a library and the development of its anomalous properties. || SCP-2602, which used to be a section of the Wanderer&#39;s library, was transformed by SCP-6000, a former gateway to the Wanderer&#39;s Library. Upon contact, the library class of SCP-6000 affected areas was changed to former, returning all matter to its form prior to being a section of the Wanderer&#39;s library. SCP-2602,as evidenced by the fact that it used to be a part of the Wanderer&#39;s Library, has since dimensionally relocated, which is common for former branches of the Wanderer&#39;s library. {{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-3856]]] - The probabilistic anomaly surrounding Foundation Researcher Samuel Lloyd and all iterations of him across the multiverse.  The death of Lloyd will always be immediately preceded by a K-Class End-of-the-world scenario. ||[[[SCP-3542]]] - An ontokinetic human that causes emergency events to regularly happen around him before using his abilities to resolve the situation.|| SCP-3542 has become the personal bodyguard of Researcher Lloyd.  The probabilistic effects of both anomalies have become intertwined resulting in SCP-3542 preventing the onset of any K-Class scenarios resulting from SCP-3856.  SCP-3542 has expressed great pleasure in being a &#34;world-saving superhero&#34; and has not interfered with other Foundation personnel.  {{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-1537]]] - A language associated with a group identified as &#34;The Brothers of Akul&#39;hil&#34; which demonstrates no connection to or similarities with any known terrestrial language.  It contains a phrase, SCP-1537-1, which, when spoken aloud, produces an anomalous reaction in human beings that perceive it. ||[[[SCP-5404]]] - An anomalous phenomenon resulting in explosions when specific words are conveyed through speech or other mediums. || Words formerly infected by SCP-5404 were spoken by a subject demonstrating the SCP-1537-B reaction.  This resulted in the SCP-5404 anomaly transferring to equivalent words in the SCP-1537 language, including onto SCP-1537-1. Usage of the SCP-1537-1 phrase invariably results in spontaneous detonation. {{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-4008]]] - An anomaly surrounding the existence or non-existence of Site-183. ||[[[SCP-4182]]] - A phenomenon by which internal Foundation documents are periodically altered to include references to the non-existent &#34;Site-5.&#34;|| **The traumas of our past will forever be repressed** [[span style=&#34;color:white;&#34;]]but never truly forgotten.[[/span]] _
{{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-3005]]] - A malfunctioning Scranton Reality Anchor that is continuously altering nearby reality to resemble that of the Fifth World.  Humans exposed to this local reality for extended periods of time become dangerously obsessed with it.||[[[SCP-2821]]] - A spherical spatial anomaly, believed to be a true vacuum, which erratically changes its size at the speed of light.  A mass of rapidly flashing colors, denoted SCP-2821-2, remains in the center of this sphere.  Radio transmissions from an unknown source occasionally originate from the anomaly.|| SCP-3005 is relocated to the center of SCP-2821.  As SCP-2821&#39;s physical laws are completely different from the rest of the universe, SCP-3005&#39;s effects treat it as its own universe and only alter its reality.  The fundamental laws inside of SCP-2821 have become illogical and self-contradicting causing it to be unable to induce vacuum decay outside matter it contacts.  SCP-2821-2 has since rearranged itself in the form of a 5th-dimensional hypersphere and all radio transmissions have ceased.  {{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-055]]] - Forget.||[[[SCP-5321]]] - Learn.|| SCP-5321 is prevented by SCP-055’s existence as an anti-meme. Because of SCP-055’s antimemetic nature, nobody affected by SCP-5321 is properly ‘omniscient’ and therefore SCP-5321 ends early. SCP-055 ceases its antimemetic effect after this, theoretically because of the amount of people knowing about it at once as a result of SCP-5321. {{- Dr. Ufin Une}}||
||[[[SCP-4885]]] - A humanoid entity resembling the character of Waldo from the popular series “Where’s Waldo?” When somebody is aware of his exact location, SCP-4885 will approach and kill them.||[[[SCP-3008]]] - A non-euclidean IKEA grocery store. When entered, SCP-3008 is infinite on the inside. SCP-3008 is inhabited by an unknown number of hostile creatures resembling employees.|| After much struggling, SCP-4885 is brought into SCP-3008 and has begun clearing it of all inhabitants. SCP-4885 will not target anybody on the outside as his true location inside SCP-3008 is impossible to determine due to its infinite size.{{- Dr. Ufin Une}}||
||[[[SCP-096]]] - A tall and thin humanoid. When SCP-096’s face is observed, no matter the size or portion of it, SCP-096 will kill and [DATA EXPUNGED] the observer. SCP-096 can not be stopped by any means, and photographs will also trigger SCP-096. The only known method of safe observation is artistic depictions of SCP-096’s face.||[[[SCP-2148]]] - A human male who filters anything he commits to memory by covering it in black bars.|| SCP-2148 is introduced to SCP-███, and sees its face. Since this incident, SCP-███ is docile and has had its object class downgraded to Safe, while SCP-2148 [DATA EXPUNGED] {{- Dr. Ufin Une}}||
||[[[SCP-3001-J]]] - Help me, I can’t wipe my ass||[[[SCP-038]]] - A tree which duplicates objects that touch its bark.|| Following the discovery that SCP-038 could be used to restock on toilet paper, toilet paper was applied to all Foundation bathrooms and is automatically refilled. Following this, SCP-3001-J-1 can finally leave his sanitary prison.{{- Dr. Ufin Une}}||
||[[[SCP-3309]]] - The retroactive disappearance of certain anomalies and their respective documentation, theoretically caused by [DATA EXPUNGED]||[[[SCP-3999]]] - TALLORAN TALLORAN TALLORAN TALLORAN [DATA EXPUNGED]|| There is war above me, between somebody who hates me and the ones who hate his work. Pouring your hate into text has a price, and if unpaid, you fade, fade away. {{- Researchers James Talloran &amp; Adamo Smalls}}||
|| [[[SCP-1548]]] - Our solar system’s sun, which possesses unknown sentience/sapience. SCP-1548 is currently protecting Earth from outer-universal threats. || [[[shaggydredlocks-proposal | SCP-001-LOCKE]]] - The solar singularity, an event where our solar system’s sun begins transforming all individuals exposed to sunlight into hostile entities, designated SCP-001-A. || Recent observations show that the sun is currently in a state of ‘indecisiveness’ regarding its motives. As such, neither SCP-1548 or SCP-001-LOCKE occur. Note that if the sun ever settles on a decision between the two, this containment method will ultimately have failed. {{- Dr. Ufin Une}}||
||[[[SCP-1504]]] - --An unremarkable caucasian male who is unable to be harmed.-- A Caucasian male who is unable to be harmed or perceived correctly, instead appearing to act within the expected behavior of the current situation. SCP-1504 is currently uncontained. ||[[[SCP-3852]]] - A phenomenon in which an anomalous cadaver manifests in a small community, leading to the lynching of an individual accused of the murder. || SCP-1504 is found hiding within a house in the town of ██████. He is currently being hunted by the entire population of the town, presumably because of an SCP-3852 event. SCP-3852 events have not occurred since, and this event is currently ongoing due to SCP-1504’s antimemetic properties and invincibility. {{- Dr. Ufin Une}} ||
||[[[SCP-4068]]] - OUTSOURCE YOUR VIRAL SYNERGIES ||[[[SCP-2535]]] - Ha! What a ride, eh folks? We&#39;ve seen printers that eat, eaters that print, and everything in between! || SCP-2535 has been &#39;infected&#39; by SCP-4068, leading to it eventually ‘spreading’ to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2030 SCP-2030] for unknown reasons. The show&#39;s title is now &#34;Chuckles are Profitable&#34; and SCP-2030-1 has freed all five former employees of SCP-2535 due to his new need to rehabilitate from his &#39;corporative conundrum.’ {{- Dr. Ufin Une}} ||
||**[[[SCP-4494]]]** - **THE SPECTRE**, a shadowy humanoid who embodies the concept of justice, making containment impossible. **SCP-4494** enjoys video games. ||[[[SCP-7400]]] - A probabilistic beaurocratohazard surrounding the online game //League of Legends//, criminalizing its players. || **SCP-4494** is informed of //League of Legends// without being told of its anomalous property. He did not appear again until █ days later, at which time he resurfaced posessing //League of Legends// merchandise. **SCP-4494** has, because of this, been separated from the concept of justice and contained, while SCP-7400’s effect has been reduced drastically and acts as a form of internet meme. {{- Dr. Ufin Une}} ||
||[[[SCP-913]]] - A middle-aged African-American man. If SCP-913 is not fed the daily caloric intake of a regular human every 2 hours, they will enter a trance state where they will eat through anything in sight. ||[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/long-live-the-king Undesignated Anomaly #304024932904] - Dr. Everett King, a Foundation researcher who manifests non-anomalous appleseeds against his own will. || SCP-913 is required to remain within 20ft of Dr. King, as Dr. King&#39;s anomalous property infinitely satisfies SCP-913&#39;s requirement to devour food. {{- Dr. Ufin Une}} ||
||[[[SCP-3017|SCP-3017-N]]] - The corpse of Frasier Melbrook, a caucasian humanoid who, prior to his death, possessed a memetic anomaly inducing suspicion among observers.|| [[[SCP-4703]]] - An anomalous grocery store possessing a beaurocratohazard labeling it as a legally operating supermarket, despite its highly immoral practices and features. SCP-4703’s manager is the hollowed-out corpse of a human being. || SCP-3017-N has been employed as SCP-4703’s manager. Because of the conflicting nature of both anomalies, both have been rendered non-anomalous. {{- Dr. Ufin Une}} || 
||[[[SCP-2000]]] - A massive complex located underneath Yellowstone National Park, capable of restoring Humanity in the event of a K-Class Scenario. ##white|None remember the one who dies to save them.##|| [[[ouroboros|SCP-001-DJK]]] - A time loop resulting in four SCP-001s occupying the slot of SCP-001 in a fixed order.

||[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/log-of-unexplained-locations|UE-464176]]] - A classroom located in Clayton High School, Tennessee. Looking through the windows of the classroom allows the viewer to see a Large, amorphous black object in the sky outside the window. As of the 27th of July, 2016, the object appears to be getting either larger or closer to the window. || [[[SCP-7076]]] - A group designation for a series of escalating anomalous phenomena targeting the projected graduating American high school class of 2076. || The graduation of SCP-7076-affected students has been estimated to be congruent with the exact date that U-464176-1 makes contact with the windows of UE-464176. On the day of graduation, the windows of UE-464176 have been shut, with the windows themselves being closed and the curtains inside obscuring the classroom. On the windows, there was a faded message written in permanent marker: _

||[[[SCP-139]]] - The anomalous disappearance of Lucian Saxe. ##white|We see you, Lucian. 👁## || [[[SCP-5999]]] - A pataphysical memetic kill agent, designed to locate and exterminate instances of [[[[sandrewswann-s-proposal |DATA EXPUNGED]]]]. || SCP-5999 has been installed into SCP-139&#39;s file. As Lucian Saxe is suspected to be accessing this file frequently, ze has been killed. {{- Dr. Ufin Une}} ||
||[[[lily-s-proposal|SCP-001-LILY]]] - An anomalous event which will initiate 24 hours prior to the conclusion of Humanity. During this event, flowers will manifest across 90% of the Earth&#39;s surface and all humans will gain knowledge of the fate of the planet. || [[[SCP-3519]]] - A highly virulent memetic contagion which convinces carriers that the world will end on March 5th, 2019, and that suicide before that date is preferrable. || Upon SCP-3519 spreading to approximately 78% of Humanity&#39;s population, SCP-001-LILY was triggered. Due to the nature of SCP-001-LILY&#39;s effect, SCP-3519&#39;s suicide-inducing symptom was overridden with the desire to repopulate the planet. After March 5th, 2019, SCP-3519 has been reclassified as Neutralized, and SCP-001-LILY has not ceased. //**Note from the Overseer Council**: Stop pestering us about this, Ethics Committee. This was out of our control and we aren&#39;t reversing world peace, you assholes.// {{- Dr. Ufin Une}} ||
||[[[SCP-2662]]] - A vaguely humanoid, cognitohazardous entity. Subjects exposed to the entity for 6 months or longer can become compelled to fulfill its every need. At least once a month, new religious followings are spontaneously generated centered on the entity, much to its distress.||[[[SCP-2456]]] - A memetic parasite that is present in an estimated 0.7% of the human population which can result in them creating and preaching a new religion. This religion transfers the memetic parasite to those to whom are preached and possesses a reality-warping effect that grows in relation to the number of followers. On rare occasions, written information about this religion triggers a powerful anti-meme which imperfectly erases the reader from existence and memory. || An active α-instance became a member of a cult spontaneously generated by SCP-2662. This member quickly rose to become the leader of the religious movement and incorporated SCP-2662 into an instance of SCP-2456-1, converting the other members into β-instances. These instances then made contact with SCP-2662 and presented it with a γ-instance as a form of worship, quickly infecting SCP-2662 with SCP-2456-2. However, due to the reality warping effects of the β-instances combined with their intense need to protect SCP-2662, SCP-2662 was not erased. Instead, all members of the cult had their memories of SCP-2662 and SCP-2456-1 erased completely. Any religions that have since formed as a result of either anomaly quickly implemented the other as well leading to their quick erasure from the minds of the infected. SCP-2662 has expressed great pleasure in this outcome.  {{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-4004]]] - A device constructed by the American Secure Containment Initiative to serve the interests of the United States of America. It is operated by a Class-6 ontokinetic humanoid entity which directly influences consensus reality by way of noosphere alteration. Formerly, abilities were used to spread pro-American ideas, but the entity has since begun calling for the complete deconstruction of the USA.||[[[SCP-4200]]] - The collective designation of --3-- 2 humans who became merged with consensus reality. They continuously manipulate the actions and thoughts of people as well physical entities to promote the growth of the United States of America and its interests.||Both SCPs are engaged in a sociopolitical-kinetic debate with each other inside of the noosphere. Whenever either SCP projects any idea into consensus reality, they are quickly &#34;rebutted&#34; by the other. Due to their contrary beliefs on the future of the USA, no consensus has been reached.  {{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-4007]]] - The collective designation for 5 anomalous individuals who served in the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. Of the original 5, only 2 are believed to still be alive and are currently at large. The original group was upholding a thaumaturgic ritual to prevent the re-emergence of an unknown threat in the South China Sea. ||[[[SCP-5700]]] - The collective designation for 7 anomalous individuals that were primarily active from 1872 to 1880 within the central northwestern United States. Of the original 7, only --2-- 3 are believed to still be alive with one in Foundation custody and the other 2 currently at large. || Foundation liaisons have formed an agreement with the remaining instances of SCP-4007 and SCP-5700. SCP-5700-1,-4, and -7 have taken up the former roles and positions of SCP-4007-1,-2, and -3, thus upkeeping the ritual for the indefinite future. The entities are given limited freedoms as long as they remain in their designated areas.

||[[[SCP-4755]]] - The ultimate purpose of all human thought, which is containment. || [[[plague-s-proposal|SCP-001-PLAGUE]]] - The fact that containment breaches continue to occur, despite the SCP Foundation&#39;s growing amount of resources. || //The ones that got away are a plague, and our minds have cured it.// {{- Dr. Ufin Une}} ||
||[[[SCP-5789]]] - Classified SCP-𝕐 prior to containment, a number which can be defined as nonexistent. When introduced to another number, SCP-5789 will &#39;consume&#39; the number, rendering it nonexistent. || [[[SCP-033]]] - Θ&#39;, an anomalous number which will destroy any surface it is inscribed on. || SCP-5789 has been introduced to SCP-033, which it consumed. SCP-5789, as a result of SCP-033&#39;s anomalous property, subsequently self-destructed and is now nonexistent as well. {{- Dr. Ufin Une}} ||
||[[[SCP-783]]] - A hostile, extradimensional entity that exclusively targets individuals that are alone and indoors after sunset. Victims&#39; bodies exhibit severe compound fractures that are healed by the generation of excessive cartilage and osseous tissue resulting in gross deformations and elongation. ||[[[SCP-957]]] - A humanoid entity that relocates to houses inhabited by a single human. The entity anomalously manipulates this human to serve them and to lure in other humans. Lured humans will be encompassed in a spherical barrier before being deconstructed by SCP-957 and similar entities. || SCP-957 relocated to the home of a human that was being targeted by SCP-783. Upon the manifestation of SCP-783 in the home, SCP-957 approached and surrounded both in the spherical barrier. To date, this barrier has not demanifested and has taken on a distorted appearance. Screams can be continuously heard from an unknown source and the elongated bodies of SCP-957 individuals occasionally fall out of the barrier before promptly being pulled back in. {{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-3002]]] - A sentient and contagious noospheric construct taking the form of an anomalous memory in those infected by it. These memories will take the form of a childhood friend named “Lily Veselka” and will gradually infect all of the victim’s memories until they are all fully converted, at which point any information discussed by the infected individual will serve as a vector for transmission. || [[[SCP-1500]]] - A featureless humanoid with greenish-gray skin. All human beings who encounter SCP-1500 will perceive it as a childhood friend or relative, and will obtain falsified memories to support this. || An individual infected by SCP-3002 was introduced to SCP-1500. Following this, SCP-1500 and SCP-3002 have been engaging in a “fight” inside the noosphere. Any memories SCP-3002 alters will be quickly reverted by SCP-1500, and vice versa. {{- Dr. Ufin Une}} ||
|| [[[SCP-6558]]] - A phenomenon where a reference to the SCP-6558 slot manifests on any other SCiPnet pages. The affected documentation will refer to the SCP-6558 page with unconventional designations. Since its discovery, the descriptions relating to it have gotten increasingly coherent and relevant. || [[[SCP-6289]]] - A file titled &#34;priest.exe&#34;, appearing as a 4.8 MB executable file. The file resembles a priest standing atop a pillar in an empty room. When SCP-6289 is placed within any folder, the folder itself and all files within become password protected. Any incorrect password leads to the user or their computer being damaged. || SCP-6558 and all infected documents are placed within a folder and modified by SCP-6289. This has limited SCP-6558&#39;s rate of infection significantly. SCP-6289&#39;s password prompt states &#34;THE WIZARD HAS AN APPRENTICE. HUZZAH.&#34; - Dr. Tiana Mark Rosanne ||
