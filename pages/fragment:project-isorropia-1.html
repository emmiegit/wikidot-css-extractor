**Vol 2**
Due to the efficacy of SCP-001 containment cycles, it has been determined by the High Council that a secondary site may be authorized for the perpetual arrest of anomalies. Project Isorropía is intended for research staff to propose containment cycles for such entities or phenomena. Personnel are reminded to append their name or codename to their proposals.

+++ Researchers who wish to submit a new entry should use the following link **[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fragment:project-isorropia-1|here]]]**.

||~ SCP Designation||~ SCP Designation||~ Containment Method||
||[[[SCP-7792]]] - A hole in reality indistinguishable from Dir. Rudolf Lingrens.||[[[SCP-5667]]] - Foundation Researcher Bill Marlow. Marlow remembers being born. || SCP-7792 consumes Marlow’s memory of being born. Following this, Dir. Lingrens is reborn. He does not remember. {{-Dr. Neil Leinnes}}||
||[[[SCP-3930]]] - A region of space near Usinsk, Russia that does not exist, nor bear any properties suggesting as such.||[[[SCP-1718]]] - A continuous and unyielding output of explosive force in every direction, currently at 0.8 megatons and ascending, contained by Experimental Containment Unit 6852.||SCP-1718 is introduced into the area supposedly occupied by SCP-3930, and ceases to exist. This continues for several days before SCP-1718 is reclassified as neutralized. Despite SCP-3930&#39;s — and now SCP-1718&#39;s — non-existence, the area has since undergone a notable rise in temperature. {{— Dir. Terminus}}||
|| [[[SCP-1057]]] - An animate empty space in the shape of an adult tiger shark. || [[[uiu-file-2014-014 | UIU-2014-014]]] - A metaphysical shadow of a basking shark that eats concepts. || UIU-2014-014 devours SCP-1057&#39;s concept of &#34;absence&#34;, transforming it into a nonanomalous tiger shark. UIU-2014-014, having taken the concept into itself, ceases to exist. {{- Dr. E. T. Cetera}}||
||[[[SCP-2200|SCP-2200-1]]] -A sword composed of an alloy of silver and copper, estimated to have been constructed between 1,000 and 500 BCE. It will autonomously relocate and bond to a selected human, now designated SCP-2200-2, who will inevitably use SCP-2200 to take the lives of other humans. Afterwards, a likeness of the individual containing the personality and memories of the original, an instance of SCP-2200-4, is formed out of an anomalous, silver-based alloy within the area classified as SCP-2200-3. ||[[[SCP-5140]]] -A number of frozen corpses located on Mt. Everest that absorb the heat of anything they make physical contact with instantly, lowering the subject&#39;s temperature to 10°C. Any individuals that expire during this process become another instance of SCP-5140.||Upon the death of the previous SCP-2200-2, SCP-2200-1 relocated.  At the same time, all living SCP-2200-4 instances abandoned SCP-2200-3 and promptly ceased animation. Video recordings captured instances screaming of &#34;the cold grip of death.&#34; No new instances of SCP-2200-4 have appeared. SCP-2200-1 was later discovered at the peak of Mt. Everest, standing upright with its blade driven into the mountain&#39;s surface. A thick layer of ice has formed around the entirety of SCP-2200-1 and it has not relocated since. All SCP-5140 instances have been found to no longer anomalously absorb heat energy and have undergone advanced decay. A misinformation campaign is in progress to cover-up the large amount of silver that is now found to make up Mt. Everest. The identity of the new SCP-2200-2, if one exists, is currently [[[SCP-1529|under investigation]]]. {{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-5541]]] -A temporally certain outcome expressed throughout all future timelines that will be observed by the Foundation Temporal Anomalies Department. In all observed timelines, the SCP Foundation&#39;s infrastructure is completely destroyed resulting in the world becoming aware of anomalies. Anomalies will progressively be accepted into society issuing in an era of peace and prosperity until a QK-Class &#34;Quantum Degeneracy&#34; End-of-World Scenario occurs and all life on the planet ceases to exist. It is believed that the anomaly manifested when the Foundation Temporal Anomalies Department discovered it and traveled back in time to prevent its creation, creating a closed-loop temporal paradox.||[[[SCP-7011]]] -A highly augmented anomalous supercomputer, formally known as the Artificial Local-Intelligence Clairvoyance Engine (ALICE), capable of predicting all possible future outcomes of events in a given area. It uses this predictive ability along with making micro-reality alterations to guide events to the outcome it calculates as most beneficial. SCP-7011 is currently using these abilities to manipulate the entirety of the town of Joseph, Oregon. ||SCP-7011&#39;s artificial intelligence conscript was given access to superior hardware to drastically increase its processing power, its reality altering capabilities, and the range of its localized omniscience. With these improvements, SCP-7011 was able to discover SCP-5541 and recognize the threat it posed to humanity. SCP-7011 is continuously altering reality in minor ways, imperceptible to the general public, to prevent RCT-Δt from creating SCP-5541. However, due to the closed-loop nature of SCP-5541, SCP-7011 is only able to perpetually delay its creation. SCP-7011 has dedicated itself entirely to delaying SCP-5541&#39;s creation and its effects on current baseline reality have been deemed negligible. {{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-6183]]]-C - A methodology for deletion of anomalies from reality using their own documentation.|| [[[SCP-2786]]] - A narrative-based reality-warping bipedal humanoid who identifies as a hero archetype and is partially susceptible to containment within looping monomyths. || Slot vacated, relevant reference pointers severed from all blackbox sectors of the Database; {{HERO}} successfully deleted. Two minutes later, an arm manifested within the chamber and displayed a rude hand gesture, dematerializing moments later. All communications with the Department of Deletions have since ceased. {{HERO}} considered neutralized within our reality. Unknown consequence for whitespace sectors. - {{Dir. Genevieve}} || 
||[[[SCP-6000]]] - The largest Class-W transportation gateway, colloquially known as a Way, ever encountered by the Foundation. It is growing at an unstable rate and is transforming all it makes contact with into a section of the extradimensional location known as the Wanderer&#39;s Library. ||[[[SCP-2602|SCP-2602, which used to be a library]]] - A building that used to be a library. When communicating any information about SCP-2602, subjects are compelled to make frequent reference to the fact that SCP-2602 used to be a library. Subjects are incapable of communicating, directly or otherwise, any information pertaining to SCP-2602&#39;s use between its time as a library and the development of its anomalous properties. || SCP-2602, which used to be a section of the Wanderer&#39;s Library, was transformed by SCP-6000, a former gateway to the Wanderer&#39;s Library. Upon contact, the library status of areas affected by SCP-6000 was changed to former, returning all matter to its form prior to being a section of the Wanderer&#39;s Library. SCP-2602, as evidenced by the fact that it used to be a part of the Wanderer&#39;s Library, has since dimensionally relocated, which is common for former branches of the Wanderer&#39;s Library. {{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-3856]]] - The probabilistic anomaly surrounding Foundation Researcher Samuel Lloyd and all iterations of him across the multiverse.  The death of Lloyd will always be immediately preceded by a K-Class End-of-the-world scenario. ||[[[SCP-3542]]] - An ontokinetic human that causes emergency events to regularly happen around him before using his abilities to resolve the situation.|| SCP-3542 has become the personal bodyguard of Researcher Lloyd.  The probabilistic effects of both anomalies have become intertwined resulting in SCP-3542 preventing the onset of any K-Class scenarios resulting from SCP-3856.  SCP-3542 has expressed great pleasure in being a &#34;world-saving superhero&#34; and has not interfered with other Foundation personnel.  {{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-1537]]] - A language associated with a group identified as &#34;The Brothers of Akul&#39;hil&#34; which demonstrates no connection to or similarities with any known terrestrial language.  It contains a phrase, SCP-1537-1, which, when spoken aloud, produces an anomalous reaction in human beings that perceive it. ||[[[SCP-5404]]] - An anomalous phenomenon resulting in explosions when specific words are conveyed through speech or other mediums. || Words formerly infected by SCP-5404 were spoken by a subject demonstrating the SCP-1537-B reaction.  This resulted in the SCP-5404 anomaly transferring to equivalent words in the SCP-1537 language, including onto SCP-1537-1. Usage of the SCP-1537-1 phrase invariably results in spontaneous detonation. {{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-4008]]] - An anomaly surrounding the existence or non-existence of Site-183. ||[[[SCP-4182]]] - A phenomenon by which internal Foundation documents are periodically altered to include references to the non-existent &#34;Site-5.&#34;|| **The traumas of our past will forever be repressed** [[span style=&#34;color:white;&#34;]]but never truly forgotten.[[/span]] _
{{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-3005]]] - A malfunctioning Scranton Reality Anchor that is continuously altering nearby reality to resemble that of the Fifth World.  Humans exposed to this local reality for extended periods of time become dangerously obsessed with it.||[[[SCP-2821]]] - A spherical spatial anomaly, believed to be a true vacuum, which erratically changes its size at the speed of light.  A mass of rapidly flashing colors, denoted SCP-2821-2, remains in the center of this sphere.  Radio transmissions from an unknown source occasionally originate from the anomaly.|| SCP-3005 is relocated to the center of SCP-2821.  As SCP-2821&#39;s physical laws are completely different from the rest of the universe, SCP-3005&#39;s effects treat it as its own universe and only alter its reality.  The fundamental laws inside of SCP-2821 have become illogical and self-contradicting causing it to be unable to induce vacuum decay outside matter it contacts.  SCP-2821-2 has since rearranged itself in the form of a 5th-dimensional hypersphere and all radio transmissions have ceased.  {{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-055]]] - Forget.||[[[SCP-5321]]] - Learn.|| SCP-5321 is prevented by SCP-055’s existence as an anti-meme. Because of SCP-055’s antimemetic nature, nobody affected by SCP-5321 is properly ‘omniscient’ and therefore SCP-5321 ends early. SCP-055 ceases its antimemetic effect after this, theoretically because of the amount of people knowing about it at once as a result of SCP-5321. {{- Dr. Ufin Une}}||
||[[[SCP-4885]]] - A humanoid entity resembling the character of Waldo from the popular series “Where’s Waldo?” When somebody is aware of his exact location, SCP-4885 will approach and kill them.||[[[SCP-3008]]] - A non-euclidean IKEA grocery store. When entered, SCP-3008 is infinite on the inside. SCP-3008 is inhabited by an unknown number of hostile creatures resembling employees.|| After much struggling, SCP-4885 is brought into SCP-3008 and has begun clearing it of all inhabitants. SCP-4885 will not target anybody on the outside as his true location inside SCP-3008 is impossible to determine due to its infinite size.{{- Dr. Ufin Une}}||
||[[[SCP-096 |SCP-███]]] - A tall and thin humanoid. When SCP-███’s face is observed, no matter the size or portion of it, SCP-███ will kill and [DATA EXPUNGED] the observer. SCP-███ can not be stopped by any means, and photographs will also trigger SCP-███. The only known method of safe observation is artistic depictions of SCP-███’s face.||[[[SCP-2148]]] - A human male who filters anything he commits to memory by covering it in black bars.|| SCP-2148 is introduced to SCP-███, and sees its face. Since this incident, SCP-███ is docile and has had its object class downgraded to Safe, while SCP-2148 [DATA EXPUNGED] {{- Dr. Ufin Une}}||
||[[[SCP-3001-J]]] - Help me, I can’t wipe my ass||[[[SCP-038]]] - A tree which duplicates objects that touch its bark.|| Following the discovery that SCP-038 could be used to restock on toilet paper, toilet paper was applied to all Foundation bathrooms and is automatically refilled. Following this, SCP-3001-J-1 can finally leave his sanitary prison.{{- Dr. Ufin Une}}||
||[[[SCP-3309]]] - The retroactive disappearance of certain anomalies and their respective documentation, theoretically caused by [DATA EXPUNGED]||[[[SCP-3999]]] - TALLORAN TALLORAN TALLORAN TALLORAN [DATA EXPUNGED]|| There is war above me, between somebody who hates me and the ones who hate his work. Pouring your hate into text has a price, and if unpaid, you fade, fade away. {{- Researchers James Talloran &amp; Adamo Smalls}}||
|| [[[SCP-1548]]] - Our solar system’s sun, which possesses unknown sentience/sapience. SCP-1548 is currently protecting Earth from outer-universal threats. || [[[shaggydredlocks-proposal | SCP-001-LOCKE]]] - The solar singularity, an event where our solar system’s sun begins transforming all individuals exposed to sunlight into hostile entities, designated SCP-001-A. || Recent observations show that the sun is currently in a state of ‘indecisiveness’ regarding its motives.

In a subsequent development, SCP-3143 underwent a process of assimilation by the sands associated with SCP-1915. SCP-3143 has consequently been reclassified as neutralized. {{—Nobody}}||
||[[[SCP-1765]]] - The collective designation for a group of three semi-corporeal, reality-bending entities that have taken over a Foundation site and forced its inhabitants to take part in several repetitive and often dangerous tests.||[[[SCP-4839]]] - A multiversal Foundation iteration that has become obsessed with the containment of all things.|| **SCP-1765-1:** Sisters, it appears we have found someone in dire need of our guidance.

||[[[SCP-3812]]] - A powerful reality-altering entity, formerly Sam Howell, a non-anomalous African-American presumed deceased in 1996. It is powerful enough to access levels of reality superior to our own, [[[narrativistics-and-you|although the capabilities of this property are still debated.]]] ||[[[sandrewswann-s-proposal|SCP-001-SWANN]]] - A group of beings who reside on a higher level of reality than ours, and are capable of manipulating our multiverse through the acts of writing and imagining. ||The gods tried to outshine the star in every way, but the more they tried, the more they themselves were overshadowed. The star may not be as dominant as the gods, but it will never truly die. For the more it goes out, the more it lights up. {{- Anonymous}} ||
|| [[[SCP-447]]] - A ball of green slime (447-1) capable of passively generating viscous greenish slime (447-2) capable of refining and lubricating objects. **SCP-447 MUST NOT IN ANY CASE COLLIDE WITH A DEAD BODY.** || [[[SCP-6502]]] - Harwick Cemetery, located in Waverly Falls, MA. All humans buried in SCP-6502 are incapable of dying, but are susceptible to rot and insanity.|| SCP-447-1 has been placed within SCP-6502, resulting in SCP-447-2 regularly seeping into the ground, as well as all beings buried within SCP-6502. As nothing underneath the ground in this area is capable of dying, nothing in the area qualifies as a ‘dead’ body. SCP-447-2’s effect preserves the physical condition and sanity of buried individuals, allowing for efficient usage and a safe removal. {{- Dr. Ufin Une}}||
||[[[SCP-7179]]] - An endless afterlife.||[[[SCP-6718]]] - The end of afterlife. ||//Death is a gift. The cure to the human condition. The one true finish line. Live your life and live it well.// {{-Professor Mint}}||
||[[[SCP-3004]]] - A Level-3 Pistiphage Entity with the appearance of a giant //Cicadetta luculenta//. Has been theorized to have formerly been the patron god of the Druidic cult known as the Cétlaidí, or the “Singers.” Subsequently, usurped the [[[SCP-343|Christian God]]] and redirect Catholic and Anglican souls to its own afterlife to devour their souls and faith. || [[[SCP-6435]]] - Afterlife NR-293-102, colloquially referred to as &#39;Ro&#39;. The ecosystem of SCP-6435 is considered a metaphysical flytrap, designed to capture and punish or reward human souls trying to reach their intended afterlives randomly. ||Upon being made aware of Ro, SCP-3004 attempted to &#34;deliver&#34; Christian souls from their random suffering and pleasure. By leaving its afterlife, SCP-3004-1 became trapped within SCP-6435 where souls were forcibly extracted and assimilated from SCP-3004-1&#39;s body. SCP-3004-1 is subsequently, worshiped and tortured by SCP-6435. Due to how closely SCP-6435&#39;s ecosystem aligns with SCP-3004&#39;s doctrine, SCP-3004-1 has ceased attempts to escape Ro. SCP-3004 phenomena has ceased. {{-Professor Mint}}||
||[[[SCP-3456]]] - A group of anomalous, predatory quadrupeds that appear near areas of intense human suffering to hunt and capture individuals before demanifesting. Direct observation of an instance will result in the entity becoming aware of the observer.||[[[SCP-3989]]] - A space-time anomaly connecting to a massive non-euclidean space. The space contains several anomalous forms of life with extreme genetic similarity to humans. An unknown vector, SCP-3989-V, obscures the space and related activity but long-term exposure can result in obsessive fascination.|| Instances of SCP-3456 were lead into the SCP-3989 space. Upon entering, the effects of SCP-3989-V obscure the SCP-3456 instances from further observation. SCP-3456 instances have begun exclusively targeting the anomalous life within SCP-3989. This is believed to be due to both the instances&#39; genetic similarities with humans and prolonged exposure to SCP-3989-V. No instances of either anomaly have since been spotted outside of SCP-3989. {{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-3553]]] -A recurring phenomenon affecting cardboard milk cartons which provide details of the disappearance of a child.  These descriptions have always accurately predicted the mysterious disappearance of children several years in advance.  Children appear to be abducted by unknown extradimensional entities.||[[[SCP-1076]]] -Numerous entities that resemble young children showing signs of severe neglect and abuse. Any parents who discover instances feel an overwhelming compulsion to take care of the child.  This results in the parent neglecting the needs of their actual children and themselves, often resulting in the death of the parent.|| The parents of a child whose disappearance was predicted by SCP-3553 were introduced to an instance of SCP-1076.  Following the manifestation of SCP-1076&#39;s effects, the original instance of SCP-3553 was replaced with a new one depicting the SCP-1076 instance.  Shortly after, the SCP-1076 instance disappeared and the family was amnesticized.  All subsequent SCP-3553 instances exclusively depicted SCP-1076 specimens.  Details given by SCP-3553 have become increasingly less professional and the interval between SCP-3553 manifestation and the disappearance of the accompanying SCP-1076 instance has decreased to only a few days.  Six months after initial crosstesting, all non-SCP-1076 children that had disappeared in connection with SCP-3553 anomalously reappeared near the spot of their original disappearance showing signs of extreme neglect.{{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-3812]]] -An immensely powerful reality altering entity of indeterminate form||[[[SCP-5800]]] -A portal to the “Fifth World”, a hypothetical alternate five dimensional reality which features heavily in Fiftheist doctrine. It is home to several hostile concepts which prey upon and consume each other.|| //The more that star tried to brighten everything, the more it realized that it was just a child in this enormous reality// {{ - Dr. Nameless}}||
||[[[SCP-2669]]] -The Khevtuul 1 space probe a foundation-designed spacecraft capable of moving faster than light.  It is currently piloted by a hostile hivemind that absorbs all consciousnesses it is exposed to.  The probe is on a direct collision course with Earth.||[[[SCP-7219]]] -A humanoid anomaly with wide-range dream-affecting and nuclear fission-inducing capabilities.  The anomaly continuously compels others to release it from its subterranean prison and will cause spontaneous nuclear reactions in response to having its release hindered. || A foundation researcher that was being targeted by SCP-7219 had their consciousness uploaded into the Khevtuul 1 probe.  Upon the hivemind beginning to absorb the researcher’s consciousness, SCP-7219 was encountered.  The resulting mental conflict between the anomalies ended with the integration of SCP-7219’s consciousness into SCP-2669.  However, the propulsion and piloting systems were damaged by spontaneous nuclear fission and have been rendered inoperable. {{ - Dr. Zero}}||
|| [[[SCP-7598]]] - a male Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) of indeterminate age. While it displays unextraordinary cognitive abilities for its species, SCP-7598 is indestructible, biologically immortal, and is capable of a limited amount of human speech. At irregular intervals, SCP-7598&#39;s primary anomalous trait will manifest in the form of a questioning event, whereupon it will state the following in a cheerful, high-pitched tone: //&#34;Excuse me! Would this be a good time to explode?&#34;//. If SCP-7598 does not hear the counter-statement: //&#34;Not right now, sweetie. Maybe later!&#34;// within 5 seconds, it will release a ██████████████████████ radius explosion. || [[[SCP-2966]]] - an anomalous roll of █████ brand toilet paper. SCP-2966 is capable of producing infinite sheets of highly effective toilet paper. However, SCP-2966 adheres the Laws of Conservation. If more or less than 8 sheets of toilet paper are removed from the roll within 24 hours, SCP-2966 will siphon or release large amounts of thermal energy in surroundings.|| SCP-7598 and SCP-2966 are to be loaded into a shuttle and transferred as far as possible from the Earth, at which point a pre-recorded message will utter the phrase //&#34;Alright sweetie. You can go know!&#34;// SCP-7598&#39;s subsequent explosion will begin to vaporize the SCP-2966, resulting in iSCP-2966 replenishing itself infinitely with SCP-7598&#39;s explosion. After absorbing, SCP-7598&#39;s explosion, SCP-7598 and SCP-2966 will be retrieved from deep space. SCP-7598&#39;s containment procedures will be updated to use SCP-2966 to relieve itself. {{- Professor Mint}}||
||[[[SCP-012]]] - An unfinished piece of sheet music, written in blood on vellum. Those viewing the sheet music are compelled to finish the piece, exsanguinating themselves to do so. Prolonged exposure is typically fatal. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/on-mount-golgotha-hub Recent research] has shown that the object’s memetic qualities are likely more virulent than first thought. ||[[[SCP-4445]]] -A device created by the Foundation to stabilise and reinforce the concept of music, after humanity ceased to comprehend music as an abstract following the Trinity Zero event. The damage to the concept of music has yet to heal, which is likely to disrupt veil operations in the event SCP-4445 ceases to function. ||By integrating SCP-012 into the SCP-4445 array, it is excluded from its stabilising effect. Those who view SCP-012 are unable to comprehend it as a piece of music, negating its anomalous qualities. In addition, a diluted version of SCP-012’s obsession inducing effect has begun to affect humanity at large, resulting in a noticeable uptick in of ground-breaking musical developments and thereby the frequency of positive M/HRAV fluctuations. {{-Dr. Solomon Beck}}||
||[[[SCP-1915]]] - An extremely powerful reality warper that subconsciously alters local reality to maintain its personal status quo. The anomaly has begun exhibiting [[[the-stars-do-not-wait-for-you |sudden changes]]]. ||[[[SCP-6535]]] - A currently uncontained teenage reality warper that subconsciously alters reality to maintain its ideal world. It regularly initiates CK-Class Reality Reconfiguration Scenarios to erase any contradictions to this perspective.|| The lonely retreat from the world into their dreams, seeking comfort but only finding absence. The future brings changes that erase what we once knew. But when they find someone who understands their pain, they realize the wait was worth it.  {{- Dr. Zero}}||
||[[[SCP-CN-2510]]] - A mysterious phenomenon consisting of the neutralization of all known and unknown anomalies. It is still debated whether SCP-CN-2510 genuinely ever occurred in history or not, and the only sources that indicate its occurrence are stored on a USB flash drive device designated SCP-CN-2510-1, which was found in [[[SCP-173]]]&#39;s containment chamber.||[[[SCP-4010]]] - A phenomenon that results in the destruction of all anomalous phenomena when a complete and unique timeline is defined. It was discovered during Project Kronos, which aimed to adapt the chronology of the universe into a single consistent timeline, with Researcher Madeleine Sailer in charge of executing the project.|| &#34;I tried to make things right. I swear in the name of God that I tried, but in the end, I committed a sin, perhaps the most serious sin ever committed. The chaos that defined life became order, and this defined the death of all things. When I saw that everything was lost, God appeared to me, in his throne chamber, and condemned me.  And now, I am not worthy of mercy. [[[SCP-2165|I am irredeemable]]]. And God tried to restore chaos to the order I created, but there will still always be order, even if there is chaos.&#34; {{- Researcher Madeleine Sailer}}||

The author of this entry remains unknown, but is possibly linked to a version of Foundation Agent &#34;Agent Dumah&#34;, real name [[[uiu file 2017 003|Yehuda Mizrachi]]] in at least one universe, the unknown individual who vandalized a version of the [[[WMDD s Proposal|WMDD 001 Proposal]]] (colloquially known in Sites allowed to read it as &#34;Project Palisade&#34;) that was sent to a Foundation from a now-destroyed universe but was eventually recovered from analysis of the destroyed timeline, and/or the unknown individual who formerly inhabited [[[SCP-3591]]].[[/span]] [[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon lizard&#34;]]The corruption is thought to come from side effects resulting from using the two anomalies to contain each other, which may have absorbed suspected ritual contamination resulting from highly experimental methods that attempted to contain the [[[WMDD s Proposal|Threat]]] or ████ that potentially linked it in some way to at least one 4413-adjacent entity. This remains unproven, along with theories that story-based binding previously occurred between The Threat and the Apex-Tier Pluripotent Entities Father Light and Mother Void.
