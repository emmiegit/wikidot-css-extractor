**Item #:** SCP-315-DE

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-315-DE only affects Foundation personnel, cases are to be ignored and the subject walked off and questioned after its performance. Occurrences outside of the Foundation are, provided civilians were present, veiled as planned performances of self-written poems.

**Description:** SCP-315-DE designates a global phenomenon, during which an affected Foundation employee abruptly begins to talk about their own greatest worries, fears, and/or problems. The duration of such an event varies between subjects and is apparently dependent on their well-being. Rhyme schemes and verse number are also dissimilar. Once the process has begun, a premature completion can only be achieved through termination of the affected person, whereas other halting attempts are integrated into the usually extremely exaggerated performance of the subject. Persons who experienced such an occurrence reported a feeling of relieving release and euphoria, which subsides in the following three to four days. Subjects are unable to remember the occurrences. It is unknown why only active Foundation personnel is affected, and not dismissed.

**Foreword:** Multiple recorded instances of SCP-315-DE from different sites across the globe are listed in the following.

**Subject:** D-438[[footnote]] Personnel was in the vicinity of his cell during the occurrence.[[/footnote]]

**Content:**
[[=]]
In a coffin of concrete and stone,
prepared by own misdeed,
is where my inner being broke down,
and it became earthly frosty.

The silhouette stands outside,
the stature of which&#39;s unknown,
for the hangman has yet to serve it;
a swift death&#39;s in limbo.

I was cared for and adored,
by the rose, dear honey,
but even failed in love&#39;s labor,
the jewellery robbery as felony.

The knocking from outside,
me all too familiar,
but now the key&#39;s utilized,
the time has come.

[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Subject:** Agent Herrman

**Content:**
[[=]]
The mask can hardly be kept on the visage,
what it hides is harder to hold,
what grins at you from behind the façade,
the web beneath you tend to ignore,
the former made of strings with plans.

Should she slip,
I would be punished,
he, who only fulfills the objective,
O the solitude of being by myself.

A drop flows out of my eye,
when it sees the past,
but not the salt&#39;s taste I find,
for it is the saliva,
by the persons of mockery.

I have to prove myself,
I will no longer be teased by them.
Outside I shall now step
and bring an end to it all in an instant.

**Remark:** The affected agent was exposed as an Mages Academy member and detained.

**Subject:** Dr. Amber[[footnote]] A Mexican female researcher by the English branch.[[/footnote]]

**Content:**
[[=]]
Everything lost its color in this plane
and merely is so monotonous.
That&#39;s how I exist,
one day it shall take me with it.

The sun has scraped clouds in front of her,
so that she must no longer see my stature.
Is the sun a graven image?
Another sun beam about to vanish.

This grew the brain parasite,
who shrills between my every eye,
I should lay down on a mattress-less bed
and turn off this last lamp.

**Remark:** Dr. Amber was admitted psychological treatment.

On the 03/08/2022, an incident occurred during a cleaning process with D-3829 in the cell of [[[SCP-129-DE]]]. When D-3829 touched the head of SCP-129-DE out of curiosity, the employee experienced an SCP-315-DE seizure. Due to the telepathic abilities of SCP-129-DE, the latter was frightened, but showed signs of great relief shortly thereafter, while D-3829 recited a poem about mortal fear. During later interrogations, SCP-129-DE reported to have seen a gigantic eye with four white wings full of feathers in a cloudscape, as it said: &#34;Patre monitores te.&#34;[[footnote]]Latin for &#34;The lord guards thee.&#34;[[/footnote]] SCP-315-DE is therefore assumed to be caused by said entity. Afterwards, some employees began to call this entity &#34;guardian angel&#34;.
