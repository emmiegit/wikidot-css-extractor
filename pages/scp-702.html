**Item #:** SCP-702

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-702 is to be contained in a crate lined with mundane packing materials. The crate is to be kept in a standard security locker with armed guards at all times. If the crate is breached, under no circumstances are any personnel to touch the SCP without wearing a pair of standard insulated gloves and an insulated coat. The slated destruction of SCP-702 is indefinitely postponed due to the unknown effects on SCP-702-1 and possible containment breaches.

**Description:** SCP-702 is a simple red vase of unknown design. Human contact with the vase causes an entity (herein referred to as SCP-702-1) to emerge from the vase and initiate contact with the individual coming into contact with SCP-702. The method of detection seems to be thermal in nature, as SCP-702-1 emerges when contact is established through thin, heat-transmitting materials, but does not emerge when contact is established through an insulated material. SCP-702-1 is a sapient gas-based life form that communicates through coordinated vibration of the air around it. A sample has been impossible to gather due to SCP-702-1&#39;s tendency to react violently to anyone coming into physical contact with it. Upon emergence, SCP-702-1 greets the subject establishing contact with SCP-702, and attempts to persuade the subject to give it a gift. If the subject refuses, the entity [DATA EXPUNGED] and takes a single object or part from the remains. Some objects are rejected by SCP-702-1, claiming that it &#34;already has one&#34;, and demands a new gift, returning the offered object. If SCP-702-1 accepts the offered gift, it returns an object of roughly equal value to the subject and disappears. See Experiments 702-001 through 702-004 for a transcript of successful transactions with SCP-702.

**Addendum:** 
Transcript Log of Experiment 702-001:
 
&gt; Subject D-5567 was issued a freshly sharpened #2 Ticonderoga pencil.
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject D-5567:** So, I just touch it?
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** That&#39;s right, D-5567. You have the object ready, correct?
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject D-5567:** Yeah, &#39;s just a damn pencil, don&#39;t really see what I&#39;m gonna do with it, though.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** Don&#39;t worry about that, just touch the vase.
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject D-5567:** Alright, alright.
&gt; 
&gt; [a sound of rushing air is heard]
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject D-5567:** What the HELL?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-702-1:** Greetings, corporeal one! I presume you are here to deal?
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject D-5567:** I, uh, ah, uh...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** The pencil, you idiot!
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject D-5567:** Uh, yes, sir! H-here you go...
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-702-1:** Thank you, bodybound! Here is your object. That will be all.
&gt; 
&gt; [An intake of air is heard]
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject D-5567:** A... an eraser?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** Very good, D-5567, proceed to debriefing.
 
Transcript Log of Experiment 702-002:
&gt; Subject D-1699 was issued a crystalline sculpture of ██████████████, procured by the Psychological Ward from a patient.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** D-1699, proceed.
&gt; 
&gt; [A sound of air rushing is heard]
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject D-1699:** Aaaah!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-702-1:** Is it time to trade so soon? How delightful!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-702-1:** Well, you are clearly the one who bothered me, speak up!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** Talk to it!
&gt; 
&gt; [Subject D-1699 gibbers incoherently]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-702-1:** You waste my time, fool. We shall not deal.
&gt; 
&gt; [DATA EXPUNGED]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** Subject D-1699 was killed by SCP-702-1. The sculpture was recovered.
 
Transcript Log of Experiment 702-003
 
&gt; Subject D-1010 was issued a crystalline sculpture of ██████████████, procured by the Psychological Ward from a patient.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** Go ahead, 1010, we haven&#39;t got all day.
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject D-1010:** No, what&#39;s it gonna do? You gotta tell me first, doc!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** Subject D-1010, I remind you that deviation from protocol will result in immediate termination by Foundation security staff.
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject D-1010:** I... I... fine.
&gt; 
&gt; [a sound of rushing air is heard]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-702-1:** Your kind again! I do so love new pieces for my collection!
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject D-1010:** Oh God, collection? I don&#39;t want to die!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-702-1:** I have only a short time, slow one, and you waste it. Do you desire trade, or no?
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject D-1010:** Tra- you want this fucked up statue?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** SCP-702-1 appears to be considering the statue and is emitting a humming sound.
&gt; 
&gt; [**Note**: Harmonics testing later indicated a frequency associated with deep thought.]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-702-1:** How very... //interesting//. Here is my response.
&gt; 
&gt; [an intake of air is heard]
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject D-1010:** A... wow, that&#39;s heavy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** Proceed to debriefing, 1010.
&gt; 
&gt; [long period of silence, recording clicks off and clicks on again]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** SCP-702-1 issued a two point eight kilogram jar of an unidentified liquid. The jar appears to be made of glass. The liquid is clear, but I am //not// removing the lid to identify odors. The jar will be sent to the labs for chemical analysis.

Transcript Log of Experiment 702-004:
 
&gt; Subject D-8133 was issued a vial containing a sample from [[[SCP-158]]].
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject D-8133:** So I touch the vase with this in my hand and give it away if I can?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** That is correct, D-8133. Please listen to briefings in the future.
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject D-8133:** Awright, doc, don&#39;t get your panties in a knot.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** Just proceed with the experiment, D-8133.
&gt; 
&gt; [a sound of rushing air is heard]
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject D-8133:** The fuck?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-702-1:** Those of flesh and blood, sinew and bone again! Your kind always has such //fascinating// trinkets, and trade has never been so brisk!
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject D-8133:** Here, take this and let me outta here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** SCP-702-1 is emitting a hum, as in Experiment 702-003.
&gt; 
&gt; [**Note**: Harmonics testing later indicated a frequency associated with fear.]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-702-1:** Absolutely not. I am tempted, but I cannot possibly afford that. Good day.
&gt; 
&gt; [an intake of air is heard]
&gt; 
&gt; **Subject D-8133:** So, uh, can I leave?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** Absolutely, Subject D-8133. Head to the debriefing room, and well done.
