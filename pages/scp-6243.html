**Special Containment Procedures:** The entrance to the pocket dimension has been purchased by Foundation Front Company 181 (&#34;Samson-Coulscott Properties&#34;) and is designated Provisionary Site 6243. The location is constantly monitored for exiting individuals. No entry outside testing is permitted. 

SCP-6243-A-1 is contained at Site-17 following Standard Humanoid Containment procedures with Class V Socialization privileges. It requires a feeding tube.

SCP-6243-B-2 is considered neutralized. It has been amnesticised and released under Cover Story 13 (&#34;Silent Retreat at Monastery&#34;).

**General Description:** SCP-6243 is a humanoid female of at least 90 years of age, referring to itself as &#34;Frau Holle&#34; (&#34;Misses Holle&#34; in German). The possibility of SCP-6243 being the origin of the German fairytale &#34;Frau Holle&#34; is under investigation by the Department of Folklore&#39;s German division.

SCP-6243 resides in a pocket dimension with a point of entry located in a well in ██████,  ██████[[footnote]]Classified - requiring Level 3 or 6243/4 clearance. Reason: Information security. [[/footnote]]. GPS tracking and radio communication to the outside does not work inside the pocket dimension. If SCP-6243 is capable of leaving its pocket dimension is unknown.

SCP-6243-A-1, formerly known as Alice Westfort, is a 1997-born Caucasian female. Whenever it opens its mouth, SCP-6243-A-1 vomits resin pitch. SCP-6243-A-1’s skin is covered in a thin, unremovable layer of an unidentified black, powdery substance. SCP-6243-B-1 was the designation for ██████[[footnote]]Classified - requiring Level 3 or 6243/4 clearance. Reason: Due to being released from Foundation custody and no longer anomalous, identifying characteristics, including the name, of SCP-6243-B-1 have been redacted for privacy reasons.[[/footnote]], an African-American female that, whenever it opens its mouth, has a single gold coin drops out of it, and its skin is covered in a thin layer of unremovable gold dust.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Appendix A: Evidence 6243-A/B-2&#34; hide=&#34;- Close Evidence&#34;]]
**Evidence 6243-A/B-2 - Intake Questionnaire - Section 7**
The following section of the intake questionnaires of SCP-6243-A-1 and -B-1 were performed on tablets. The questionnaires have been compiled into one for ease of use.

&gt; **Instruction:** Please describe how you arrived inside the location you described to our agents.
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-6243-A-1 Response:** Went urban exploring with friends, checked out an abandoned farm with a well, leaned over to see if there was anything in the well, somehow fell into it and fell out of the sky.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6243-B-1 Response:** I thought I had heard a painful sound from an animal and was worried that it was hurt. I thought the sound was coming from the well between a few old buildings that I showed your colleagues. I checked the well to make sure it wasn&#39;t trapped inside and probably tripped, thus falling inside.

&gt; **Instruction:** On what date did you enter? On what date did you leave?
&gt;
&gt; **SCP-6243-A-1 Response:** Went in on the 10th [[footnote]]March 10th 2022[[/footnote]] and left two days later.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6243-B-1 Response:** I believe, I was inside from the 6th of June 2021 to the 15th of March 2022 from what I&#39;ve been told.

&gt; **Instruction:** Please describe the location.
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-6243-A-1 Response:** Endless field of wildflowers and grass, could hear a creek, tree line on the horizon, that never seemed to get any closer as I walked, a grey tower and a speaking oven and apple tree.
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-6243-B-1 Response:** It was like a place from a Studio Ghibli or Disney movie. The clouds looked more like props than like real clouds. The sky was blue and orange at the same time. It felt like an orange sunrise, but when I think about it now, it felt like it was blue. It&#39;s weird. I don&#39;t think I could see the sun. There was also an old, grey tower. I decided to walk there and passed an apple tree and an oven that could speak.

&gt; **Instruction:** Please describe the aforementioned oven.
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-6243-A-1 Response:** Spoke with a British accent, begged for the bread to be taken out, and was very old. Avoided it; though I had hit my head when I fell.
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-6243-B-1 Response:** There was an oven with bread inside, still burning. I could hear a voice coming from it asking for the bread to be taken out. I don&#39;t know where the voice came from; it felt like the oven itself was talking, but I opened it and got the bread out without problems. It thanked me, and then stopped talking, so I left it and headed on to the tower.
 
&gt; **Instruction:** Please describe the aforementioned apple tree.
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-6243-A-1 Response:** Also talked, but with a Canadian accent. Very old/thick trunk, too green leaves and too perfect, too large apples. Also avoided it.
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-6243-B-1 Response:** After encountering the oven, I also encountered an apple tree. It spoke and asked for the apples to be harvested, because its branches felt heavy and exhausted, so I obliged and helped. I shook the branches and then gathered them. It thanked me and stopped talking.

&gt; **Instruction:** Please describe your first encounter with the entity you call &#34;Holle&#34; and the entity itself.
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-6243-A-1 Response:** Ended up at the tower where I knocked. Looks ~90yo, super large teeth that only show when her mouth is open, white, looks friendly, but gives off a weird vibe. Asked for help, but she only spoke German. Barely managed to communicate. She offered me to be her live-in-maid in exchange for board.
&gt;  
&gt; **SCP-6243-B-1 Response:** After the apple tree, I arrived at a tower. A lady calling herself Misses Holle offered me to stay if I helped her with her housework. Because I didn&#39;t know what else to do and where I was, I agreed and started helping her. She was very kind, just a tad odd. She didn&#39;t have any technology or even knew what my phone was. She only spoke German with me. I don&#39;t think she understands English.

&gt; **Instruction:** Please describe how you left the location.
&gt;
&gt; **SCP-6243-A-1 Response:** Freaked out when my phone died, so I grabbed a knife from the kitchen to confront her. Tried to tell her I wanted to go home. She seemed to get it and just took me to a gateway on a path and told me to walk through it and follow the path. Then //this// happened. Tried to shower for //hours//, but couldn&#39;t get it off.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-6243-B-1 Response:** She came to chat with me when I was doing chores and asked why I looked sad. I explained that I was homesick and wanted to go home. Misses Holle then suddenly agreed to take me home. I hadn&#39;t realized that she knew how to get me home; I&#39;d just assumed she was stuck here like me. She took me to a gate that I hadn&#39;t seen before and told me to walk through it. When I did, everything was covered with gold dust that stuck to me, and I found myself back in the real world.

= **Excerpt of Interview Transcript 6243-58**
= **Negotiation with SCP-6243 on Neutralization of SCP-6243-A-1 and -B-1**
----
**INTERVIEWED:** SCP-6243

**INTERVIEWER:** D-0422

**NOTE:** D-0422, who is fluent in German, was briefed on the situation and given the task to negotiate the removal of the anomalous nature of SCP-6243-A and -B. D-0422 was instructed to follow the behaviors of SCP-6243-A-1 inside the pocket dimension. The following conversation has been translated into English from the original recording.

Afterwards, D-0422 was designated SCP-6243-A-5. Further research into means of aiding SCP-6243-A-1 and its neutralization into society is ongoing.

----
 
**D-0422:** Something like that. I’m here to speak to you about ██████ and Alice Westford.

**SCP-6243:** Ah! Yes! I remember those two. Such a lovely girl, ██████, was. I do miss her. How is she doing? Do you know her?

**D-0422:** I&#39;ve been sent to ask you to take back your gift. It prevents them from living a normal life. Please take it back. ██████ enjoyed her stay with you a lot, but she wants to go back to her normal life. Alice, too. Can you do that?

**SCP-6243:** I… I thought she’d like it! I’m quite disappointed in that reaction. You’re right! If she doesn’t want it, she won’t get it! Children nowadays... I’m… I’m disappointed. Very unfortunate.

**D-0422:** So, can you remove it?

**SCP-6243:** I already have! Only grateful children receive gifts.

//At approximately the same time, the golden layer on SCP-6243-B-1’s skin becomes removable via unknown means. SCP-6243-B-1 no longer drops gold coins out of its mouth.//

**D-0422:** Okay. How about Alice?

**SCP-6243:** Oh, that brat? Is she unhappy? She deserves it!

**D-0422:** Ma’am, she was in an unfamiliar environment and a stranger suddenly ordered her to do her housework. That’s slavery.

**SCP-6243:** Alice is a cruel, selfish woman with a soul filled with darkness and evil! What I have done only shows her inside on the outside!

//Extensive negotiation has been removed from this appendix, as no new information is gained. SCP-6243 and D-0422 negotiate for 1 hour, 3 minutes, and 2 seconds.//

**D-0422:** Is that... a no, then? Nothing is going to change your mind?
 
**SCP-6243:** I shall never, my child. You poor pawn of a child, do not fret, I am in no need of aid in my humble abode. I merely wish to see the nature of each of my guests; to see if they&#39;re willing to help my persona of a helpless, elderly woman. I do believe that you have offered all that you can offer me now. Would you like to help me clean my chambers? My brittle bones won&#39;t do anymore.

**D-0422:** Sorry, ma&#39;am, but I will need to return to the real world. Could you, err, take me back? Please?

**SCP-6243:** Ah, don’t worry. I’m sure you and your Foundation //Jailors//[[footnote]]SCP-6243 uses the English word &#34;Jailor&#34;, which is a term used by GoI-α-019 (&#34;Serpent&#39;s Hand&#34;). A potential connection is being investigated by the External Affairs and Intelligence Agency, but currently, this is the only instance of SCP-6243 using the term.[[/footnote]] will find many more doors to my dear home. Those two girls weren’t my only guests after all. I consider you a guest too. But if you wish to return… I must oblige. Do follow me, I will lead you home.

**To:** sierra.jules@scip.net &lt;Dr. Sierra Jules&gt;
**From:** tomreiter@mymail.com &lt;Tom Reiter&gt;
**Subject:** [EXTERNAL] SCP-6243 Problem
[[/div]]
------
**THIS EMAIL ORIGINATED FROM AN OUTSIDE EMAIL. PROCEED WITH CAUTION. SCAN FOUND NO MEMETIC, INFO- OR COGNITOHAZARDS.**

Hey boss,
couldn&#39;t reach you on the secure phone line.

I&#39;ve got a situation at home regarding 6243. I have reason to believe that my daughter became a -A instance after falling into the pocket dimension via our outside basement door. That fucking monster turned my daughter into a fountain. We need to help these girls.

Please call me ASAP. She needs help.

Ellie said that &#34;the lady said to tell you to stop bothering her or this will get worse&#34;. I&#39;m NOT going to let 6243 threaten my family. What does it even want from this all? If nobody responds to this, I&#39;m gonna go in there and tell 6243 to leave my daughter alone on my own.

Tom

= **Note**
The following email was sent to Dr. Jules, the head of the SCP-6243 Research team. The lack of response is attributed to the total digital and physical lockdown of Site-17 at the time due to a containment breach. A potential connection is considered unlikely at this stage but is under investigation. 

No contact has been made with Reiter since the sending of this email. Ellie Reiter has been taken into Foundation custody and designated SCP-6243-A-7, Reiter&#39;s residence has been purchased and turned into Provisionary Site-6243-2 and his disappearance reasoned with Cover Story 19 (&#34;Housefire&#34;). 

**Update 2022/06/10:** D-9812 was sent into the pocket dimension for recovery of Researcher Tom Reiter. SCP-6243 claimed no knowledge of Reiter, but recordings show a new &#34;trial&#34; to have appeared inside the pocket dimension: a small shack that asks for its door, resembling Reiter&#39;s basement door, to be closed. Voice analysis performed by Neural Network 1821.29 v1.1 indicates 95% certainty of matching Reiter.

Due to the incident on 2022/06/06, SCP-6243 is pending reclassification to Keter.
