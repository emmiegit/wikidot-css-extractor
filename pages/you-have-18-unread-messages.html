Jessica crossed off February 28^^th^^, 2019 on her calendar. She couldn&#39;t help but smile a little. Two months off the grid. Alex and Cindy thought she was joking at first, but Jessica had just quit her job at Google, and her parents owned a small cabin in Montana they used as a vacation home. It was the perfect opportunity to get away.

Two months ago, Jessica felt anxious whenever she checked her phone. Or her email. Or turned on the TV. Her body would tense up, bracing for the bad news. It was always bad news. Even the good news was bad news, since it meant there was more news.  

She prepared a breakfast of beef jerky and eggs. She cooked the eggs over a self-made fire using the wood she&#39;d chopped the other day. 

After she finished her meal, Jessica went back to the bedroom. She kept her laptop and phone in a safe next to the nightstand. Her smile widened a little more. After so long away, Jessica was looking forward to reading messages again.

//I wonder how everyone is doing?//

&gt; **Cindy (1/29/2019):** I know you&#39;re off the grid but the news has me worried. It&#39;s stupid I know, but I just want to make sure you&#39;re ok. Please, call me when you can.

Jessica froze.

&gt; **Cindy (1/30/2019):** I want to talk to you. Call me.

&gt; **Alex (1/30/2019):** I told Cindy not to text you. You probably don&#39;t want to hear about this prophecy bullshit anyways.

&gt; **Mom (2/2/2019):** I know you haven&#39;t attended mass for years, but could you pray before you go to sleep tonight? It would put your father and I at ease.
[[=]]
Her brain entered overload.
[[/=]]
&gt; **Mom (2/3/2019):** Did you pray last night?

&gt; **Alex (2/5/2019):** Someone looted your apartment last night. I&#39;m so sorry. You can crash at my place when you come back, if you want.

&gt; **Mom (2/6/2019):** Your dad and I just want you to be saved. 

&gt; **Cindy (2/9/2019):** COME BACK ALREADY! WE STILL NEED TO GO ON ANOTHER HIKE TOGETHER!
[[&gt;]]
All the anxiety, the intensity, the stress.
[[/&gt;]]
&gt; **Alex (2/11/2019):** I miss you.

&gt; **Mom (2/15/2019):** You were always one of the unsaved. 

&gt; **Cindy (2/17/2019):** My brother hung himself. I got his weed stash. I&#39;ll save some for when you get back.
[[=]]
It came back, all at once.
[[/=]]
&gt; **Cindy (2/19/2019):** I&#39;m having an orgy at my place this weekend if you&#39;re interested.

&gt; **Alex (2/20/2019):** I always loved you. I&#39;m going to propose when you get back.

Building pressure inside her head.

&gt; **Cindy (2/22/2019):** I fucked Alex for you last night. 

&gt; **Cindy (2/23/2019):** I buried Alex for you this morning.
[[=]]
Pushing. Pushing.
[[/=]]
&gt; **Mom (2/25/2019):** I should&#39;ve aborted you.

&gt; **Cindy (2/26/2019):** I ran out of weed.
[[&gt;]]
About to burst.
[[/&gt;]]
&gt; **Dad (Today):** If you see Jesus on the [[[SCP-3519|Judgement Day]]], tell him I&#39;m sorry for my sins.
[[=]]
Jessica relieved the pressure by putting an axe through her head.
