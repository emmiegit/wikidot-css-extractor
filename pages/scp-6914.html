**Item #:** SCP-6914

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Pending

**Special Containment Procedures:** All previous procedures have been halted pending further investigation.

**Description:** SCP-6914 is a grandfather clock, heavily modified. The face has been replaced with a round digital display, although it still ticks as normal.

Periodically, SCP-6914 will chime, before displaying a name, date and time. It will continue to show this information until the named individual dies, invariably at the cited time, at which point it will chime again and switch off. These events take place seemingly at random, with a maximum recorded time of five years and nine months between one prediction taking place and the next being made. Predictions have been made for anywhere between two years and seven minutes in the future. All matching deaths have occurred in Britain.

All attempts to prevent or otherwise alter these events have failed.

**Addendum 15:** Notable cases.

&gt; **Victim:** Sofia Delgado
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Time of death:** 12/01/1999, 2:03 PM
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** This being the first event to occur under containment, SCP-6914’s effect was not fully understood. As such, identification and retrieval was deemed only a moderate priority, and Delgado was not located until after the due time, at which point she had died from alcoholic liver disease in Blackpool Victoria Hospital, Lancashire.

&gt; **Victim:** Ülkü İbrahimoğlu
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Time of death:** 23/10/2002, 10:42 PM
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** İbrahimoğlu was the first victim successfully contacted prior to the event after several failed attempts, typically due to the victim&#39;s name being too common in the region to specify. Two hours before the event, he was contacted, informed that his life was in danger and instructed to stay in his home. MTF Zeta-20 (&#34;Flag Snaggers&#34;) was dispatched and arrived with twenty-seven minutes to spare, with orders to guard İbrahimoğlu until the due time had passed.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; While there, [REDACTED][[footnote]]Because it cannot be determined whether the individual was negligent or unconsciously influenced by a poorly-understood anomaly, name has been withheld.[[/footnote]] lit a cigarette by a gas stove that had been left on, leading to a chain of events culminating in İbrahimoğlu being trapped in the resulting conflagration with Agent Shaughnessy. The agent made a full recovery despite smoke inhalation and second-degree burns, but İbrahimoğlu died at the scene.

&gt; **Victim:** Valerie Whitaker
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Time of death:** 07/02/1933, 11:20 AM
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

&gt; **Victim:** ███████ McIver
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Time of death:** 20/12/2021, 12:08 AM
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** McIver was located six months prior to her time of death. Given that this was the first opportunity for long-term study, she was fully informed of SCP-6914 and its anomalous properties, and agreed to participate in interviews and testing, as well as relocate to Site 135 a week before the due time.[[footnote]]McIver requested that the Foundation not inform her of the exact date and time; this was deemed acceptable.[[/footnote]] At time of writing, she remains under observation. Researcher Farnsworth has been designated her Foundation liason.

[[tab Addendum 27: Preliminary interview with McIver.]]

&gt; **Interviewed:** ███████ McIver
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Farnsworth
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Interview took place at McIver&#39;s home.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** And we&#39;re recording. Could you please state your name for the record?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** It&#39;s McIver. Uh, ███████ McIver.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Thank you. Ah, before we start, is there anything we can do to make you more comfortable?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** ...tell me why my house is full of soldiers? Tell me why you&#39;re sitting at my kitchen table looking like you&#39;re about to accuse me of treason? Just... generally tell me what&#39;s going on.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Farnsworth hesitates, before putting down his pen and leaning back in his chair.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Yes, right. Yes, you&#39;re right. I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m normally more professional in these sorts of situations, but this is...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** This is what?! Will you please just... explain? Am I in trouble or not?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** It&#39;s... oh, there&#39;s no standard procedure for this, so I&#39;m gonna be blunt; we work for a secret multinational organisation dedicated to the study, containment and protection of the paranormal and unexplained.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //There is a moment&#39;s silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** So, uh...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** So...? Obviously, I don&#39;t believe you, but this is a hell of a lot of effort to go to to take the piss, so whatever you&#39;ve got next is either gonna be //hilarious// or blow my mind. Quite keen to see which, actually.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Farnsworth pauses, before reaching into his bag under the table and retrieving [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5306 SCP-5306-B]. He places it on the table, equidistant from him and McIver.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** What&#39;s that?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** It&#39;s a lapt-
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Farnsworth cuts himself off, and takes a breath.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** It&#39;s one of the anomalous things we contain. Parks, if you wouldn&#39;t...?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Parks throws SCP-5306-B to the floor and begins smashing it with hir rifle.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Jesus! What the hell are you-
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Give it a minute.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //When Parks is done, the screen has split from the main body, and most of the keys are scattered around the kitchen. McIver turns back to Farnsworth.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** And... that accomplished...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Just keep looking.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //As they watch, SCP-5306-B begins regenerating, slowly growing new keys and showing evidence of a screen developing.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** I... I don&#39;t...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** In an hour, it&#39;ll be right as rain.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** And... it&#39;s just a laptop?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Touch it if you want.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Yeah, uh, I&#39;m not sure I do, thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //They both watch it continue to regenerate.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** It belongs to a centuries-old pirate skeleton. He uses it to sell dodgy movie streams.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** You know, I&#39;m not even going to question that.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** If there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learned in my line of work, it&#39;s that the world absolutely refuses to make sense.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Silence. McIver turns to Farnsworth.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Are you //serious//? You wanna explain to someone that they live in //Doctor Who//, and you do it by //smashing up a laptop//? That was the best you could do?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Alright, there&#39;s no need for that! I&#39;m supposed to keep this secret! This is //wholly// out of my wheelhouse.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** One of you better bloody clean it up.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She frowns.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** If this is a big cover-up, which - by the way - is //really// messed up, what are you doing telling me?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Farnsworth is silent, looking down.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Is this - am I - //[she half-laughs, cocking her head]// like, &#34;the Chosen One,&#34; or something?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Look, Mr- ███████-
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Mr. Farnsworth, what&#39;s going on, what&#39;s happening, why don&#39;t -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** SCP-6914.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** I don&#39;t-
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** SCPs, that&#39;s what we call the anomalous things, it stands for... oh, it doesn&#39;t matter, but - SCP-6914 is, well... it&#39;s a clock, that... //[he clears his throat]// Periodically, SCP-6914 will chime, before displaying a name, date and time. It will... continue to show this information until...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //He hesitates, and sighs.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Until they die.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Who&#39;s name was on it?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** ███████, I -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Please! Just... say it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** I&#39;m sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Farnsworth does not look at her.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Okay. Right. Okay.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** You&#39;re taking this rather better than I expected, I have to say.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** What, you want me to flip the table, kneel out in a rainstorm and scream at the heavens? There any way out of this?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** ...No.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Then there wouldn&#39;t be any point, anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Are... how are you feeling?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //McIver goes to speak, but stops. She swallows.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Scared. Obviously, I&#39;m scared, and... upset, and everything, I don&#39;t wanna die. //[she half-laughs]// I&#39;ve got too much stuff to do. And, like, my mum and dad...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She trails off.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Fuck. I&#39;ve gotta tell my mum and dad.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** How long have I got? Actually no, I don&#39;t wanna... Fuck, what am I...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** We have counselling on-site. We&#39;ll support you as best we can.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Yeah, thanks for that. I mean, no, I... //[she sighs]// I&#39;m sorry, I know it&#39;s not you.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** You&#39;re apologising to me?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** //[she laughs]// Yeah, I know. Can you lot just... give me a minute? I just need to... process.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Of course.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //He stands, and goes to leave the room, before half-turning back.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** I... really am sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;END LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** Following a short break, the agreement cited in Addendum 15 was drawn up. McIver accepted the Foundation&#39;s secrecy, and in exchange was permitted to get her affairs in order under a cover story still in development.

[[tab Addendum 45: Excerpts from scheduled follow-up meeting, five months from time.]]

&gt; **Interviewed:** ███████ McIver
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Farnsworth
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Interview took place at McIver&#39;s home.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** How did the session with Palaiologina go earlier?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Good? I think good, anyway. We decided my parents would get most of my stuff, it was just easier. Anything I&#39;d be, uh, embarrassed for them to have goes, um, somewhere else. Still figuring it out. Rest goes to foodbanks, or the charity shop, or whatever.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Very generous.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Purely because I feel obliged to, I promise. Besides, not like I&#39;m gonna need it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** I suppose not. Nothing for any of your friends?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Uh. Guess not.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** ..mm. I spoke to Dr. Chase the other day. They said you&#39;ve not been in touch.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** I haven&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** I really do think it&#39;d be worthwhile. If nothing else, they can refer you to a decent end-of-life counsellor.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** I&#39;m alright - I mean, I //appreciate// it, but I&#39;m fine. Besides, I have more important stuff to think about.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //McIver leans over the table, clasping her hands.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Alright, so what d&#39;you reckon? How do you tell your parents you&#39;re gonna die?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She gets up and begins pacing, slowly and aimlessly.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** I was thinking, maybe, tell them I&#39;ve got a terminal illness or something? Nothing //too// dramatic, just something definite. Give them time to prepare, and all.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She stops, chewing her pen.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** But like... that gives them months, or years, or, I dunno, whatever to stew on it. I don&#39;t wanna draw it out. Maybe a short, sharp shock would be better. You can tell them I was saving a bus full of orphans or something. Hmph.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //McIver sits back down heavily, leaning back and twirling her pen.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Hard, this. What would you do? If it were you?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** I&#39;m not the best person to ask.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** And still, I do so.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Okay. Er, I wouldn&#39;t bother, because as far as they&#39;re concerned I&#39;m already dead.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Damn. //[she pauses]// Wait, is that what they do here when you join? Make you fake your death, because that&#39;s -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** No! I didn&#39;t - I was being metaphorical, you know what I mean.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Brief silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** I suppose I //am// dead to them, in a way. I&#39;m certainly not the person they knew anymore. I haven&#39;t been for a long time. //[he hesitates]// Although... well, does a caterpillar die when it becomes a butterfly? I don&#39;t think so. There&#39;s still that continuity there. Not all change is death.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Wow. Deep. Caterpillar to butterfly&#39;s a hell of a transition, I&#39;d hate to see the old you.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Oh, don&#39;t be - look, this isn&#39;t about me. This is about you. It&#39;s been four weeks now, what have you been doing?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** I... don&#39;t know what -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** I mean, how has this been affecting your life?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //McIver fidgets, twisting her hands.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** I started watching //the Sopranos// last week.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Farnsworth blinks.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** You... you started watching...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** I&#39;m nearly done with series two.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** I don&#39;t...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Okay, look, I&#39;ve always wanted to watch it! And like, like, I might not get another chance, so I thought I might as well.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Right.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Neither look at each other.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Any good?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Really good. Funnier than I expected, too.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Good. Mr. McIver, I must admit, I expected you to be making bet- er, you to be using your time differently.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //McIver flinches.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Didn&#39;t realise this was the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** If I were in your position, I wouldn&#39;t be sitting in a flat bingeing boxsets. I&#39;d be... getting out there. Travelling. Doing all the things I&#39;d never have done otherwise.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** I wouldn&#39;t have watched //the Sopranos// otherwise.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Farnsworth sighs, massaging his temples.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Look, I realise it&#39;s not my place to tell you how to live your life, but surely you could be doing more with it? What&#39;s the point of holding back now? The thing is, Mr. McIver - 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Stop //calling// me that!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Silence. Farnsworth is frozen; McIver stands abruptly, her chair screeching back.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** You know what, you&#39;re right. It&#39;s //not// your place. It&#39;s //my// life, //my// death, and I&#39;ll do whatever the hell I want with it, have you got that?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Yes, of course. I&#39;m sorry. //[he pauses]// Are you, though?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //After a few seconds, McIver slumps back in her seat.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** I work in Tescos. The day after you showed up, I went in. Four hours on customer service, four hours on the tills. We had a sale on gardening equipment. I went across the road to get a sausage roll and an eclair from Greggs on my break. A woman called me a chav because I wouldn&#39;t refund the Lego Star Wars set she&#39;d bought from Argos.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She drums her fingers on the table.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** It just... keeps happening.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** What does?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Stuff. You know. It&#39;s like... you have this big moment. This big epiphany. And it&#39;s seismic, like, it&#39;s everything. The biggest thing that ever happened, the most important thing in the world. And, well, it changes everything, nothing&#39;s the same afterwards.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She picks up an empty mug of tea, and stares into it.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Except it is, isn&#39;t it? You wake up the next day, you still have to go to work. Buy paracetamol. Put the bins out. The world keeps onwards, and you get swept up in its wake, and eventually that huge moment isn&#39;t so huge. It gets swept along, too, and there&#39;s nothing you can do about it. Just another thing, in a sea of things. Another thing that doesn&#39;t really matter.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** ...I see.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Both are quiet.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** If it matters to you, there&#39;s nothing more important.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //McIver scoffs.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Do you really believe that?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** ...honestly? No. I took a course on interviewing people in crisis, that&#39;s the sort of thing you&#39;re supposed to say.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** //[she laughs]// Way to be blunt there, Farnsworth.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** You know what, you were right. Maybe you can&#39;t just... tear down your life and do what you want, but you have some wiggle room. Just some space to breathe. Watch //the Sopranos.// Try bubblegum ice cream. Go to the shops in something you wouldn&#39;t usually wear. Small things, just to make you feel like you, that you&#39;d be scared to do otherwise.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Bubblegum ice cream&#39;s disgusting.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Noted.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //A brief pause.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** I&#39;m not scared. I don&#39;t know. I just can&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** I understand. Look, I&#39;ll give you a bit of time to think.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Okay.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Farnsworth goes to speak, but hesitates.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** What would you like me to call you?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** What?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** ...you know, it&#39;s fine, I&#39;m not the best with people, so forgive me if I&#39;m misreading anything, but... I&#39;d hate people calling me Miss Farnsworth.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //McIver freezes, and Farnsworth takes a moment before continuing.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Maybe that person&#39;s dead after all. She got me this far, and I appreciate that, but it... well, it just couldn&#39;t continue. And... if that makes sense to you, it&#39;s... it&#39;s fine. Just so you know.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //McIver is very stiff, but manages a nod.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Good. Right, yes, good. Well, if you need us, you know how to contact us.

&gt; **Interviewed:** ███████ McIver
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Farnsworth
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** Interview took place at McIver&#39;s home.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** But I still don&#39;t understand //why//.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** It&#39;s really not that complicated.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Yeah, well, we&#39;re not all geniuses. Was he hallucinating the rabbit guy, or was the rabbit guy a ghost from the future, or something? What did the plane engine have to do with anything? Was he dead the whole time?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Look, it doesn&#39;t really matter //why//. It&#39;s metaphor, you&#39;re supposed to work out what it //means//, what it represents.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Alright, what does it //mean//, then?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** ...look, that&#39;s not the point.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** //[she laughs]// You pretentious dick.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** That&#39;s a little harsh -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Nah, it&#39;s not.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //McIver scratches at her face. Farnsworth watches.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Oh, you did paint your nails?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** //[she looks at her hands]// Oh, uh, yeah. Everyone at work thinks I&#39;m just going through a glam phase. And... well, it&#39;s like you said. Little things.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** It looks nice.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Sure. //[she pauses]// I went to the corner shop as a woman.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** What, really? That was... quick.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Well, it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve got... I... I sort of have to speedrun this whole process, don&#39;t I? Not much point in pissing about, is there? Anyway, wanna know what I was wearing?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** //[he frowns, cocking his head]// Yes...?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** This lovely blouse, with little ducks on, comfy pair of leggings... boots, big shapeless coat, scarf, mask, sunglasses, woolly hat. Truly, I am an icon of trans bravery.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** //[he laughs]// Small steps.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** They must have thought Marilyn Monroe had walked in. Wrapped in an entire charity shop.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She hesitates for a moment.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** I told my parents on Tuesday.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Oh. //[he glances down at the mug in his hands]// Fancy another drink?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Uh. Yes, thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Farnsworth get up and begins making tea, raising his voice over the kettle.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** How did it go?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** ...good, I think? As well as could be expected, probably. Mum cried, acted like I&#39;d killed her &#34;son,&#34; but no-one called me any slurs or disowned me or anything.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** You&#39;d qualify that as good?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** I&#39;ll take what I can get. Visiting again tomorrow.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** You know you&#39;re not obliged to.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Yeah, well. The more they see me, the more they can get used to me, I&#39;m gonna be there as much as I can over the... near future.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Carrying the mugs, Farnsworth returns to the table.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Mm.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** I asked them to call me Lily.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Oh?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Rolls off the tongue well. Lily McIver. It was that or my gran&#39;s name, and I couldn&#39;t look myself in the mirror if I willingly called myself Esmeralda.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** //[he snorts]// Understandable. I went by Felix for a bit, until I realised I sounded like an obscure comic book character.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //McIver laughs.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Felix Farnsworth, yeah, that&#39;s awful. You wouldn&#39;t even be a superhero or anything, just some random henchman.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Killed after two panels.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Yeah. //[she pauses]// Gotta be honest, I&#39;m not sure how much this is helping you. Research-wise.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Secure, Contain, Protect. The last one matters too. Or so my superiors insist on telling me every time I come here.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Oh, so you don&#39;t care, after all?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** I&#39;m just doing my job.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Sure you are. //[she stretches]// D&#39;you know what, I... don&#39;t get the chance for a decent conversation often. I&#39;ll take what I can get. Even if that takes the other chatter being paid to do it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Mm.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //There is a moment of silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Have you seen //Dr. Strangelove//? That&#39;s another classic.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;END LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** The next time following this meeting that SCP-6914 was observed, it was noted that the name on the display was no longer &#34;███████ McIver.&#34; It instead read &#34;Lily McIver.&#34; The implications of this are uncertain.

[[tab Incident Log 6914-3]]
CCTV footage of Lily McIver, crossing from 19/12/2021 to 20/12/2021. She had been moved to a Site 135 dormitory by this point. Researcher Farnsworth had been ordered to observe her death.

&gt; **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Farnsworth paces up and down in front of McIver&#39;s room door. In one hand he holds a small box; with the other he incessantly fastens and unfastens his shirt cuff. Periodically, he gestures towards knocking, before resuming behaviour.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Abruptly, McIver opens the door and Farnsworth freezes. Her arms are folded.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** It is //twelve in the morning//. You have been clomping about out here for //twenty minutes//. What is it?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Farnsworth checks his watch.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** It&#39;s two minutes to, actually. Alright, I&#39;m... working late, and I just thought I&#39;d see how you&#39;re doing. So, uh... how are you doing?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** //[she stares]// Well, I&#39;d be doing better if I were asleep.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** I know, I know, I&#39;m sorry. Just wanted to see how you were settling in.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Weird time to ask.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** I... had an opportunity.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Well. Uh. The food is meh, except for the treacle tart and custard -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Oh, I //love// the treacle tart and custard.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** //[she blinks]// Uh, yeah. Sure. Er, there&#39;s not a lot I&#39;m allowed to do or see, but everyone&#39;s very nice.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** How many of them have apologised for you being stuck with me?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** What? None! Don&#39;t be daft!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Brief silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Five. But they don&#39;t count as nice. Think the cute Scouser&#39;s quite into you, though.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** What, Samuels? //Him//?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Hey, might be worth a go. Make the most of the time you have.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Make the - I&#39;m sorry, who&#39;s dying here?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** You, clearly. Dying for that dick.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** What - you -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** That&#39;s more like it. //[brief pause]// Listen, you&#39;re being weird, what&#39;s going on?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Well, uh...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //He checks his watch.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Twelve-oh-one.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //He hands her the box.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Happy birthday.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** ...damn, you&#39;re keen, aren&#39;t you?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** I like birthdays.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //McIver opens the box, and pulls out a cream-coloured silk scarf.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** I know you like scarves, and, I thought it was tasteful, you can hide your Adam&#39;s apple behind it if you want, I think, I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve never tried it, but -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //McIver lunges forward and embraces Farnsworth. He stays rigid.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** It&#39;s also thin enough that it should be comfortable enough to wear in summer.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Summer? Love your optimism.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She takes a step back, releasing Farnsworth.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Thank you. For everything.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Farnsworth does not move, then checks his watch.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Yes. Well, good, yes.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //A moment of silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Was there, uh, anyth-
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** //[quickly]// Would you like a cup of tea?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** A cup of - it&#39;s a bit late for that, isn&#39;t it?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Well, I suppose. Maybe you should call your parents, celebrate a bit, talk to them. //[he checks his watch]//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** What the hell has gotten into...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She falls silent.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Why didn&#39;t you just come in the morning?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** //[he hesitates]// Like you said, I&#39;m just keen. Couldn&#39;t wait for midnight.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Then why are you still checking your watch?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Farnsworth is silent.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** You should really call them.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** ...no. We had Sunday roast last week, we joked around, Dad even started calling me she halfway through, that&#39;s... good. That&#39;s good enough. That&#39;s a nice way to go out. I already recorded that message, that&#39;s more than a lot of people do, I don&#39;t need two encores. No need to make a fuss.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** You&#39;re worth a fuss, though, Lily.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** ...that&#39;s... really nice of you to say. But really, I&#39;m actually okay. I don&#39;t want anyone to not be.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //McIver does not speak. Farnsworth cannot.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** //[she stretches]// God, I&#39;m so sick of waiting around. All I&#39;ve ever bloody done. Have I still got time for that cuppa?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Farnsworth checks his watch and clears his throat, wiping his eyes.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** 12:07. I, uh, don&#39;t think so.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Damn. No time left for tea, there&#39;s a British tragedy for you. Well, uh... I never did come up with a cool quip, did I? Promise me you&#39;ll make something up for me.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** //[he snorts]// I&#39;ll do my best.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Yeah, you better. This is important, you know. And... tell my parents I love them. I know, we haven&#39;t always seen eye to eye, and I know you don&#39;t like them, but... I really do love them, so much. And however they see me, I&#39;m so glad they got to know me as a woman. Even if it was only for a bit. I&#39;m... glad I got to be Lily.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //There is a brief pause. Farnsworth stares at his watch.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Sorry, am I boring you?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** You&#39;re not dead.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** What?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** I&#39;m sorry, could you give me a moment?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //He darts down the corridor and out of sight.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** The fuck?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Farnsworth runs to the nearest office, glances at the wall clock, before frantically waking the computer. He checks his phone, looks at the monitor, before running back to McIver. She has not moved.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** //[gasping for breath]// I synced... my watch up... earlier... thought I&#39;d cocked it up... it&#39;s right...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** What -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She is interrupted by Junior Researcher Samuels coming down the corridor.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Samuels:** Alright, Farnsworth, I know I&#39;m the last person you wanna see right now, b- //[he sees McIver and stops dead]// You&#39;re not dead.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Wow, you researchers are really earning your pay today. Will someone just... explain?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Samuels:** It&#39;s 12:11. Your time was 12:08.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Dead silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** So I was...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Samuels:** Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** But I&#39;m...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** No.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //The three are motionless for a moment, before Farnsworth and Samuels turn to each other.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth and Samuels:** //[in unison]// Call Sorenson!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Both run off down the corridor, Farnsworth lagging somewhat. McIver is left standing in the doorway, alone.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She turns, and begins walking to her bed, slightly unsteadily. She sits down and stares out of the door at nothing in particular. Her face is blank.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Huh.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;END LOG&gt;**

After thorough testing, McIver was found to be in perfect health. The reason for SCP-6914&#39;s failure is unknown, and further study has been tabled.

&gt; **Interviewed:** Lily McIver
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher Farnsworth
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** First interview since Incident 6914-3.
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Alright, we&#39;ve ran every medical, physical, metaphysical, spiritual and IQ test we can think of. We&#39;ve had thauma - //[he sighs]// magicians evaluate you and the clock. We&#39;ve spoken to clairvoyants, psychics and time travellers, and I can safely say that you, Lily McIver, are not going to die.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //McIver says nothing.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Not for a bit, anyway. Congratulations.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //McIver says nothing.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** I&#39;m going to be honest here, Lily, I was expecting a little more of a reaction than this.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Not surprised. All you&#39;ve done the last six months is tell me how wrong I&#39;m feeling.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //A moment of silence.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** I&#39;m sorry, have I -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** I lied.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Excuse me?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** That first interview, when you asked me how I was feeling. I said I was scared and angry, and, upset. I was lying. You know what I was feeling?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** I don&#39;t -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Nothing. I felt nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //No-one speaks.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** I didn&#39;t want to die. That was true. I still don&#39;t, not really. It&#39;s like... I don&#39;t know. I&#39;d never really given it much thought, not really. But when you said it, it was...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Great, now I&#39;ve got to actually talk to my parents about the whole trans thing. Good thing I didn&#39;t listen to you, or I&#39;d&#39;ve spent the rent on a trip to the Himalayas.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Farnsworth barks a laugh.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Yes, I suppose so, now, I think -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Oh, you&#39;ve done plenty of //that//, I&#39;m fairly sure I hear you &#34;think&#34; when I try to sleep.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Alright, that&#39;s just unnecessary, I have done nothing but try and help you for months -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Fat lot of good your help was! Where the hell has your help gotten me? Look at me, I&#39;m disgusting! How am I supposed to come back from //this//? //[she gestures at herself]//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Come //back// from it? Oh, you&#39;re blaming me for your own choices. How very mature. I must say, my friend, you didn&#39;t exactly need much of a push.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** //But I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d have to deal with it//!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //Both take a moment to catch their breath.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** I thought that was it. Now I have to keep... going, and going.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Not like everyone else, then.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** But I don&#39;t understand //how//. I thought there&#39;d be a cut-off point. And I... well, I couldn&#39;t see past it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** Yes, and now you&#39;ve passed it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** And I still can&#39;t!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She looks to the side, and sighs.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** How can I? I&#39;m... not prepared to go on. And no, I&#39;m not suicidal, but... all that time. I might not have known when, but I spent so long thinking I&#39;d be dead, and now I&#39;m not. And it&#39;s weird, right? I really didn&#39;t feel anything, I tried to be how... how I was supposed to be, but I never really //felt// it, not like I should have. So it shouldn&#39;t bother me, right? I live, who cares, I die, who cares. And somehow I found the one option that...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** What am I supposed to do? It&#39;s just... a void. In and out.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farnsworth:** //[he rubs his forehead]// Honestly, I... don&#39;t know. Just keep going, I guess.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //McIver scoffs.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Yeah. Sure.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //A brief pause.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** I read a book once, spy thing. There was a bit in it when the main guy had been caught, and the baddie had him strapped to a heart monitor with a gun to his head. And he was making it large about how he was gonna kill him, and he was panicking, and right as his pulse was going like mad he shot him with a blank and turned the machine off. And he was fine, but he //felt// like he&#39;d been shot.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** It&#39;s like that. I&#39;m still alive, but I feel like I died.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //She sighs, and smiles wearily.//
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **McIver:** Maybe I did.
