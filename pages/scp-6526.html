**Item #:** SCP-6526

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6526 is to remain in a standard anomalous item locker at Site-83. Ingestion of SCP-6526 is strictly forbidden. Failure to adhere to this procedure will result in termination.

**Description:** SCP-6526 is a glass bottle containing an apparently infinite amount of a black, slightly carbonated beverage. Despite having an exterior labeled reading &#34;Coca-Cola&#34;, chemical analysis of the substance has revealed that it is comprised primarily of ethanol, calculated at 190 proof[[footnote]]##white|Alcohol proof is a measure of the content of ethanol (alcohol) in an alcoholic beverage.##[[/footnote]]. Taste analysis by D-Class during the initial containment of the object has revealed the substance tastes similar to standard Coca-Cola or Pepsi mixed with coconut rum.

**Discovery:** SCP-6526 was discovered following an investigation into several public intoxication reports in ███████, Pennsylvania. Foundation agents embedded in the local police force were able to successfully identify the culprit, Dominick Nelson. Nelson&#39;s cadaver was found at the entrance to an apartment complex in  ███████, and autopsies identified the cause of death to be a subdural hematoma[[footnote]]##white|A common result of falling from areas of high elevation.##[[/footnote]]. On Nelson&#39;s person were a jewelry gift box, unsigned divorce papers, a severely withered journal, a pacifier with traces of human blood, and SCP-6526.

**Recovered Journal:** 
Foundation agents investigating Nelson&#39;s private life found several references to SCP-6526 written in the journal found on his person.

I went to my first AA meeting today, and my accountability buddy suggested we keep a journal to track our thoughts throughout the days. Says it&#39;s a good way to keep track of our mental health through. I think he&#39;s full of it but, I want to get better, ya know? For Emily. 

Can&#39;t believe she&#39;s a week old already! Shiela and I celebrated with a photo shoot. Wish I could show the group. Maybe I will if I ever go back there.

I had a sip of that drink again today. More than a sip, honestly. It&#39;s like it never runs out, and the smell! But, no. I can&#39;t afford to think about it again. Not after I almost dropped Emily. 

I&#39;m never drinking again.

Shiela found the bottle, threatened to divorce me if I don&#39;t get my shit together. I told her to let me figure my own shit out. Not sure if that was the alcohol talking or me, but it&#39;s too late now. 

On top of that, I nearly forgot Emily turned a month old today. Shiela took her from me when I tried to pick her up and give her a kiss, told me my breath smelled like booze. What does she know? Bitch.

I think I deserve to treat myself, given current events. Just one more sip of that Coke and rum. Then I&#39;ll start taking this more seriously.

Emily looked at me and smiled for the first time. She&#39;s got just the cutest baby-girl grin I&#39;ve ever seen in my entire life. Her entire hand is barely big enough to wrap around my pinky finger. I&#39;d give anything for her. 

We were talking about sacrifice at the meeting today. Couple of the fellas were going on about selling their cars and PlayStations for booze and I was disgusted. Is this how far down this hole I&#39;ve gone? I&#39;m not going to let this shit control me anymore.

I just need one more drink, and then I&#39;m off it. For good. Just one more.

**Additional Page:** 
The following page was discovered folded into one-fourth its original size in the back of the recovered journal.

I&#39;m sorry, Shiela. I truly am. I never meant to hurt you, or Emily. I hope you know that. --I was drunk, and I&#39;m sorry.-- I don&#39;t have any excuses anymore. 

I love you, and I hope you can find it in yourself to forgive me. Don&#39;t tell Emily how I went, she&#39;s far too young to know. Just tell her daddy went grocery shopping with the big man in the sky. 

Love, Dom
