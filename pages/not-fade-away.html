The old water tower on the outskirts of this shit-heel town has been derelict for ages. It&#39;s amazing they haven&#39;t torn the damn thing down yet.

I reach up for the next rung, which groans in response to the unexpected weight, before snapping off entirely. I manage to catch myself at the last second, but my Go-Pro isn&#39;t so lucky. It makes a soft plop in the snow below.

&#34;There goes my perfect fucking selfie.&#34;

It was a close call though. I take a second to catch my breath, before I steel my nerves and continue my ascent. 
[[size 80%]] [[/size]]
Can&#39;t turn back now. Stick to the plan. 

You&#39;re going to be //remembered// for this.

I clamber onto the platform, and I&#39;m greeted with an oversized grin- the rival school&#39;s idiotic mascot. Its face is weathered and peeling. Good thing he&#39;s about to get a brand-new paint job. Now all I need to do is decide exactly how many dicks I should add. Time to get to work.

Just one more over here...

Oh! Let&#39;s have one splooging all over it...

...pink? The fuck did I think I was going to do with //pink// paint?

...give &#39;em some missing teeth; he&#39;ll look just like these inbred jack-offs!

...little bit more and...done!

I stand back and admire my creation in all its glory. In just a few hours, people will wake up to their beloved avatar being assaulted by a group of floating penises; as if it were the star of a haunted bukakke. Now all I need to do is snap some pics for the guys to prove that yes, I //am// that Fucking Badass. I whip out my cell and get to work-lamenting the fact that I can&#39;t post these online (if only so I can #dickasso).

It&#39;s as good a time as any for a smoke. I spark one, and look out over the woods that surround the town. Last night&#39;s snowfall blanketed the landscape, leaving a pristine coat of white that went on for miles. I could see the lake off in the distance. From my vantage point, I could clearly see over the privacy fence that encircles it. As the early-morning fog began to dissipate, I could even see the water&#39;s surface and...what the fuck is //that//? [[size 60%]]{{Can you see them out there?}}[[/size]]

I cup my hands around my eyes -- as if make-believe binoculars could somehow improve my vision -- and lean out over the railing. There&#39;s definitely something bobbing about the surface. It...fuck. It looks like there&#39;s someone out there?

That can&#39;t be right. [[size 60%]]{{It is}}[[/size]] They closed the lake off ages ago. [[size 60%]]{{To keep it hidden.}}[[/size]] Something about an undertow? [[size 90%]]**{{Lies.}}**[[/size]] Fuck. Well it&#39;s not my problem if some random nobody gets themselves killed. [[size 60%]]{{They&#39;re closer to you than you&#39;d think.}}[[/size]]

As much as I want to turn away, I can&#39;t. [[size 60%]]{{Because you want to know the truth.}}[[/size]] I&#39;m frozen to the spot, precariously hanging over the railing. There&#39;s something about them. Something familiar? [[size 80%]]{{Don&#39;t you remember?}}[[/size]] The redhead...

[[size 60%]]{{Katie Lawson}} [[/size]]

We met in Home Ec class. She was always so patient and caring. [[size 60%]]{{She still cares.}} [[/size]] Took a trip with me and several of my classmates over the summer to check out the new Space Mountain. We shared our first kiss during the fireworks display on the third night. I...made some dumb promises I knew I couldn&#39;t keep...[[size 60%]]{{There&#39;s still time.}} [[/size]]

[[size 60%]]{{Doug Garner}} [[/size]]

A total blast to have around. Always wanted me to tag along on his misadventures. {{He didn&#39;t want to be all alone.}} We got caught sneaking in to see Jaws; I managed to get away before the cops showed up, he wasn&#39;t so lucky. Never sold me out, either. [[size 60%]]{{And risk losing you?}} [[/size]]He always had my back. [[size 60%]]{{Don&#39;t let him down.}}[[/size]]

[[size 60%]]{{Ben Ward}}[[/size]]

Lived across the street from me our entire lives. [[size 60%]] {{He&#39;s been there the whole time.}}[[/size]] I could never ask for a better friend. [[size 60%]]{{And he, you.}} [[/size]] We began drifting apart once he started getting pretty deep into his schoolwork. [[size 60%]]{{He was scared of what you might think.}} [[/size]] Every once in awhile he&#39;d stop by, just to chill. [[size 60%]] {{Because he missed you. Don&#39;t you miss him too?}}[[/size]] Last time we talked was when he treated me to Queen&#39;s show at the Paramount back in April.

I fall backwards, reeling from a mix of vertigo from the height; light-headedness from the cigarette, and a sudden, splitting migraine. I press my palms into my eyes, trying to get my head straight. I can&#39;t even focus on myself now though. There&#39;s people down there. They need my help. Without even bothering to clean my evidence (I&#39;ll be back for it), I drop to the ladder and begin climbing down. 

-----

It&#39;s a quiet ride on my bike up to the path that leads to the lake, and a crunchy one for the last mile or so. The only sound other than me plodding through the snow are the occasional gusts of wind screaming through the trees. [[size 60%]] {{No. Not the wind.}} [[/size]]

Little signs like this were posted everywhere. [[size 60%]]{{It&#39;s to keep you out. It&#39;s to keep the truth hidden.}} [[/size]] I disregard them, and trek on. I can&#39;t abandon my friends now.

The freezing water is around my ankles now. With each step I can feel the ground below getting further away...up to my thighs, and I&#39;m already shivering. My heart begins to drop. Something is wrong.

I&#39;m slowly moving out towards them...I can help. It doesn&#39;t have to be this way. We can all make it out of here. 

Up to my chest.

I can&#39;t shake the creeping dread from being in such deep water. When I was a child, an ill-advised cannonball sent me plummeting to the bottom of my uncle&#39;s pool. I freaked. I couldn&#39;t move. I flailed about in a panic, trying desperately to gain vertical ground to no avail. I thought I was going to die. Someone got down in time to fish me out, but ever since then, I&#39;ve had a horrible phobia of water. In fact, I&#39;ve never actually learned how to swim.

Up to my neck.
