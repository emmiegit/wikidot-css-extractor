**My dearest Elizabeth,**

It has been so long since I last saw your face, although I do not know precisely the amount of time that has passed. For me, I feel centuries have crawled across and marked my skin- but through the trials and tribulations, through the realms I have bore witness to- I know that it may have only been mere moments in your life.

In a way, I pray you never receive my correspondence.. torturous as it may be, given the now insurmountable distance between us.

As I write to you, I sit with legs dangling against a lonesome wind- hanging off the edge of a cliff face, overlooking a darkened sea. It reminds me of the time we spent on the coast of France, as though we had abandoned the world. Now, I&#39;m afraid, it feels as though it is the world that has abandoned me.

Do not despair my love, for I have not been alone for long. Over these trying years, I have found companionship in the form of friends and kindred spirits. There was Algoz, a stout man- having more likeness to the dwarves from our daughter&#39;s fairytales than any human from our world. Rough around the edges, but loyal like no other..

He&#39;s gone now. Just like I am, from you - my Elizabeth and our beloved Katherine.

**If only I had never walked through that blasted door.**

I don&#39;t recall why I left, only that it was in the dead of night. I remember because of the chill in the air, despite the dreadful heat wave that had been plaguing our countryside. I believe I was upset, or maybe you were- or some combination of the two. Whatever it was, it could not have been of such importance.. damn it all.. of such magnitude was the price of my action, that still I feel the shivers of regret beneath the two suns of this world.

**I remember that cold though.** It bit into me suddenly, and I turned towards a nearby cottage for shelter. I remember the bitter wet.. was it raining? Did the eyes of the gods water, or was I stained by my own tears? In all honesty, it matters not.. nothing ever mattered after the cottage. I rapped my fist against that door once, then twice. Upon the third, my hand met.. **nothing**. I fell forward, the momentum of my strike carrying me further than my mind allowed. Further then that of all possibility or reason, for the door did not move- but I did. . Tumbling, spinning- at times screeching, and at others, silence.

I fell, in blackness and nothingness, and in brightness and color- for ages or minutes or months or seconds or, just maybe, no time at all.

I wonder now if I slept during that time. Or if, drunkenly, I slumbered against the side of that cottage- and will wake up soon- haunted by the shades of alcohol, but grateful to end this waking nightmareâ€¦ No. I cannot allow myself to feel hope. **Not anymore. Not again.**

I spent time, an innumerable number of days searching for that door- the door that led me from you and one day may lead me back. I traveled through a world not our own, filled with kings and vipers, monsters and demons.. **but all of it was for naught..** That is not to say that I did not find the door. I did. It just did not lead me back to you.

Again, and again, and again- I have trekked and clawed and heaved my way through these worlds. In many an instance, I nearly died doing so. Maybe, just maybe, I should have. But each time, as I found myself left with nothing, I would find it. Standing there, alone- beckoning me.. Almost as if to say &#39;Maybe this time I will lead you home. Come and knock, and I shall answer.&#34;.. But never home. Never.

I am so weary now. Dried like the cracked rock that I now perch on- my face weathered from a thousand lives.

Just know, although I have faded- **my love for you never will.**

I believe I am done now. May you never find this letter.

Yours eternally,
**Alexander Marquis**</textarea></pre>
