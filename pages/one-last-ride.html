You know what my favorite part of a roller coaster is? The climb. You&#39;re just inching your way up that hill, and you know that the terrible drop is coming soon. Riding with family is even better. I can see the tension building on their faces as you depart from the station. I love the clicky sound it makes as you go up and up and up and... Down...

I feel gravity let go as you plunge down the first hill. My hair is in my face, and the skin on my face is stretched back. I open your mouth and let out a big scream, and then pull into a loop - eugh, whats all this in the air? It looks all red... What is this stuff? 

I don&#39;t really care anyways. We&#39;re going into the loop! Loops are the best part of any coaster. Especially when you sit in the front row. Man, the dudes in the front row aren&#39;t even putting their hands up. Everyone else does, why don&#39;t they?

The second loop is even better. It has a really sweet banked turn, so you can see everyone on the coaster going nuts. And those guys in the first row are still being sourpusses, not even lifting a hand. They aren&#39;t even... They&#39;re not cheering or anything.

No, that can&#39;t be true. It must have been a trick of the light. I&#39;m okay, everyone is okay. People are still yelling with joy, the coaster is still on. Nobody is in danger. I&#39;m okay. Time for the third loop of the ride, the cobra roll... Oh god.

I have to get out of here. This isn&#39;t fun anymore, I have to get off. I can hear everyone screaming, but nobody is stopping us. Maybe it will stop, maybe it will be okay... Oh god, it&#39;s another loop...

I can hear the people in the row before me crying. They&#39;re holding each other, crying and wailing... I&#39;m not going out that way. I have to get out of this restraint. Why is it so tight?
