I was an orphan. I was left to the care of the Phlegmfont, under the care of the mysterious Friar Clef. 

Friar Clef taught me of an ancient and forbidden faith -- Christianity -- before I reached adulthood at age 11. And then he sent me forth, to the heart of the Fundamentum&#39;s power -- the Arcana Institute of Xerophylla, where I would learn to fight in the Fundamentum&#39;s forever wars, like Daniel in the lion&#39;s den.

This is the story of how I journeyed to the center of all things that happen to me.

+ What is this?

//Qui Lactis// is a tale series set in the Nightfall canon. The primary storyline of Qui Lactis is written by [[*user LORDXVNV]], but there is plenty of room for additional contributors (see the Setting tab below if interested!)

//Qui Lactis// is about the personal journey of self-discovery of James No-Name, who believes he was abandoned by his family after a pilgrimage to [[[SCP-6248]]]. Luckily, he was taken in by Friar Alto Clef, who raised the boy as his own son and as a Christian. In this world, Christianity is a heretical and unseen faith. While some of its precepts may have filtered into society at large, the core of Christ&#39;s teachings have been fully corrupted and suppressed, so that any Christian influence is but a hollow shell of Christ&#39;s message.

Upon coming of age, James attends the Arcana Institute of Xerophylla, one of the Fundamentum&#39;s premier magical academies, where he is thrust into a world of competing loyalties, diverse characters with their own agendas, messy personal histories, and complex magic systems. The story follows his journey through the Institute to adulthood.

[[tabview]]
[[tab Setting]]
//Qui Lactis// takes place in the Nightfall Canon at a time roughly contemporaneous to everything else. Here, the Foundation is called the Fundamentum and operates in the shadows not through some global conspiracy but because there are simply so many shadows to hide in.

The primary setting of //Qui Lactis// is the Arcana Institute of Xerophylla, where the Fundamentum sends its best and brightest to become child soldiers. It is essentially a magical academy. Lessons take a mix of practical trade education, liberal arts education, and magical education, depending on the Class the student is in.

There is a strict class system, based on the Four Humors of antiquity: Blood, Choler, Bile, and Phlegm. This is one of the core elements that shapes society and their school system. Our protagonist James is of the Phlegm Class, the lowest and least respected of all the classes. While at the Arcana Institute, students dorm, learn, and train with members of their own Class primarily, but are also placed into training units with members of other classes to prepare for more practical battle situations. Notably, the Four Humors have largely taken the place of the traditional Aristotelian elements of Fire, Water, Earth, and Air.

Christianity is an all but unknown religion, and has thus not been shaped by the imperial influences of the Roman Empire beyond its origin. The only enduring Christian doctrine is the Bible itself.

While the main storyline is a closed tale series, the Arcana Institute is a suitable setting for any magical school shenanigans you may be interested in telling. All I ask is that you contact me for crit and lore compliance.

Everything else occurring in Nightfall is assumed to be canon until explicitly contradicted within the text.

[[tab Magic Systems]]
The magic systems at play are explained primarily in-universe, usually through Professor Dan (see [[[Three Lessons for Endless Night]]]). As such, the explanations in this tab will usually lag behind the story itself, and will be explained in-universe; they are subject to additional reveals.

+ Sanctity, Control, Paradigm

//Primary reference: [[[Three Lessons for Endless Night]]]//

Also known as the Tripillar Configuration, the three precepts of Sanctity, Control, and Paradigm form the basis of how the Fundamentum views human magic in this setting. 

* Sanctity: The Fundamentum teaches that all human magic must flow from the soul, whether true or not. Hence, Sanctity. Magic performed through divine power is harnessing the souls of the gods. Associated with the alchemical heavenly substance of sulfur, the soul.
* Control: The Fundamentum preaches the importance of control -- of using power, rather than being used by it. The Fundamentum is fundamentally materialist -- interested in the physical world and the control and manipulation thereof, unlike other groups of interest. Associated with the alchemical heaven substance of salt, the body.
* Paradigm: The Fundamentum preaches the supremacy of human magic and its practitioners. Hence, once Sanctity and Control are established, Paradigm allows one to reshape the world in their own image no matter what form that might take, be they Talents or Arcana. Associated with the alchemical heavenly substance of quicksilver/mercury, the spirit.

+ Arcana 
Arcana are the primary form of magic taught at the Arcana Institute of Xerophylla. Vaguely inspired by tarot cards and other games based on them, an Arcana Card grants its users powers associated with the card itself.

Every Arcana Card is tied to an anomaly on the SCP mainlist. The numbers of the Arcana cards directly correspond to a numbered SCP. However, they may involve radical reinterpretations of said SCPs.

There is an in-universe reason for this. It shall be revealed in due time.

Arcana also have a level of flexibility to the powers they grant. Individuals may be able to expand the power they can draw from their Arcana cards. Furthermore, multiple Arcana used together, whether by one individual or multiple, may produce unexpected interactions.

A final benefit of Arcana: holders of Arcana cannot die by accident. They can only die while performing acts of heroism, or be slain as an act of justice.

Other mechanics of the Arcana shall be revealed as the story progresses...

+ Anderson-Mab Pactiron Generators
Anderson-Mab Pactiron Generators are horrific spiky balls of black iron that bind wild fae, turn them invisible, and force them to perform menial tasks that are too boring or dangerous for humans to do. The Arcana Institute runs on these horrific machines, created by a deal struck between Vincent Anderson and the Tyrant Queen Mab. These machines are one of the reasons fae are so rare in this setting.

If a worldbuilding details is unexplained, you can assume the Anderson-Mab Pactbound Fae have something to do with it. Removal of chamber pots? Pactbound fae did it. Food appearing on tables? Pactbound fae did it. Death toll of a battle too high for the population level that can be supported by described agriculture? Pactbound fae did it.

Disturbingly, they are one of several Arcana-OOI -- Arcana etched so deeply into the universe that they have a sense of primacy. 

+ Talents
Talents are inborn magical abilities that individuals might have, as opposed to Arcana, which are external and transferrable. This concept was stolen from On Guard 43 by HarryBlank.

+ Other Nightfall Magic Systems:
Other magic systems introduced elsewhere in Nightfall should be assumed to work until explicitly contradicted.
