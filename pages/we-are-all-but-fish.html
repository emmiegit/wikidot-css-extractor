Ascendency is no small feat.

Apotheosis is a near impossibility for the normal human.

And yet I swear by my flesh I found godhood.

I became more than the self.

My ego folded in on itself a thousand times and a thousand more.

Flesh became a falsehood.

Stone became a falsehood.

The very fabric of space and time was insignificant.

I finally had found truth.

__Pure truth.__

Information flowed through every little particle and every piece of matter. Representations of states, of concepts, of true being.

[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6747|The True Narrative]]] splayed itself across my mind and all things. Everything, interconnected, intersected, interacting.

I knew what fulfillment was.  I knew what glory was. I knew what beauty was.

And then I saw the door. The door away from physicality. Away from functionality. Away from flesh.

It brought me into the world of ideas and forms. [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6699|Trueness.]]]

I came through, I felt warmth.

//The door promised lies.//

It was horror.

I saw everything, everywhere, everyhow, everywhat, **everywhy**.

I was lesser again.

I was dust.

And then the other gods came.

Grand.

Complex.

[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6659|Uncompromising.]]]

[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/church-of-the-broken-god-hub|Sisters.]]] [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sarkicism-hub|Twins.]]] They condemned my very form and being. Both in unison and in opposition.

A [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/cotsk-hub|king dressed in red]]] cut me down and drank my blood.

A [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3125|foreign, fathomless five-finned fish]]] ripped my mind apart.

A [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2747|queen crowned by thorns]]] smothered me away from all.

I heard a dark howling ring throughout my body and then I knew what nothingness was.

And when all was done, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/don-t-let-the-fire-die|I found a note]]]. A kind note. A comforting note.

And I was sent back to flesh once more.

------

I write this as a warning. A warning for all that we are all but fish.

Fish in a vast ocean.

Fish in the sunlight.

Do not sink.

Do not dive.

Terror awaits there.

One must accept:

The flesh is more kind than the mind.
