**Item #:** SCP-CN-1997

**Object Class:** --Keter-- Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Owing to SCP-CN-1997&#39;s extradimensional properties and the neutral nature of SCP-CN-1997-1 in anomalous society, SCP-CN-1997 cannot be fully contained at the moment. In order to maintain the phase equilibrium between SCP-CN-1997 and the baseline universe, Mobile Task Force 癸酉-10 &#34;Boundary Priests&#34; have entered the &#34;Sky Wall Maintenance Committee&#34;; in order to stabilize the phase structure of &#34;[[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/hong-shing-hub|Hong Shing]]]&#34;, designated SCP-CN-1997-1, as a pivotal point for phase equilibrium. Given that the phase equilibrium between SCP-CN-1997 and the baseline universe is relatively stable, there is no need for excessive monitoring of SCP-CN-1997 itself.

Based on SCP-CN-1997&#39;s environment, personnel entering SCP-CN-1997 are to wear Class IV or higher protective wear or equivalent equipment originating from SCP-CN-1997, and are to undergo basic thaumatological training. Sustenance obtained within SCP-CN-1997 must undergo thaumatological cleansing before consumption; personnel who consume unprocessed food originating within SCP-CN-1997 are considered to be lost, and other personnel have full authorization to execute them.

Following the &#34;Two Phases Agreement&#34;, Foundation personnel are to provide suitable protective gear originating from SCP-CN-1997 to residents of SCP-CN-1997 entering the baseline universe through Hong Shing; specific procedures are to be implemented and maintained by officers with 3/CN-1997 clearance stationed at the Hong Shing Police Division of the Hong Kong Police Force. Site-CN-71 shall also pay close attention to anomalous and non-anomalous communities in Hong Kong, specifically incidents of high doses of radiation near entrances and exits to SCP-CN-1997, and return SCP-CN-1997 natives not wearing protective gear to their homeworld.

**Description:** SCP-CN-1997 is a parallel reality adjacent to the baseline universe on the phase plane[[footnote]]Outside of this document, SCP-CN-1997 may be referred to as &#34;the Right Phase&#34;, &#34;the Dextral Reality&#34;, &#34;the World of Divine Energy&#34;, &#34;the World of Ionizing Radiation&#34;, the &#34;Glowing Reality&#34;, or &#34;the Other Side of Hong Shing&#34;.[[/footnote]]; its approach towards baseline reality between the 1950s and 1970s is thought to be the source of major reality interference leading to repeated EVE waves and reality-shocks in the Greater China region. There is no way to enter SCP-CN-1997 from the baseline universe except through SCP-CN-1997-1.

SCP-CN-1997&#39;s atmosphere is largely identical to ours; however, the standard concentration of EVE energy is 35 times higher in SCP-CN-1997 than in baseline reality. Humans residing within SCP-CN-1997 have largely similar biological structure to those in the baseline universe; however, they possess high resistance to radiation and can induce radiation within their bodies to resonate with nearby EVE, allowing thaumatological abilities similar to those of &#34;religious&#34; Type Blue humanoid entities. Autopsy of deceased individuals has revealed that their lower abdomen possesses a spherical organ capable of inducing ionizing radiation[[footnote]]Further autopsy results can be seen at [DATA DELETED][[/footnote]], which is thought to be the origin of their thaumatological abilities. As a result of the &#34;Two Phases Agreement&#34;, live testing on SCP-CN-1997 natives has not been authorized.

In addition, it has been determined that multiple humanoid species with small populations evolved from various animals exist within SCP-CN-1997. Further information is classified 4/CN-1997.

The people of SCP-CN-1997 have developed several cultures and nations, which have the following in common:
* A common theistic religion, believing that before the birth of the current civilization humanity was ruled by a race of gods, which fell in an event known as the &#34;Twilight of the Gods&#34;, leaving behind numerous artifacts and a &#34;gift&#34; for the remaining humans.
* The use of Chinese characters and Mandarin Chinese as the official script and language. English is viewed as the language of the &#34;Era of the Gods&#34;, only known to a few groups and people.
* The development of using ionizing radiation[[footnote]]The ionizing radiation within SCP-CN-1997 is regarded as a gift from the gods, and is known as &#34;divine energy&#34;.[[/footnote]] as a source of energy, giving rise to the thaumatological society within SCP-CN-1997. It has been determined that many SCP objects found in the baseline universe are actually creations of SCP-CN-1997 residents; see Addendum 2.
* Some technology of the baseline universe has been understood by the people of SCP-CN-1997, and is referred to as &#34;the relics of the gods&#34; and &#34;magic&#34;, and are kept in secret by various groups; see Addendum 3.
* A heavy reliance on &#34;divine energy&#34;; SCP-CN-1997 maintains a constant high level of ionizing radiation using various methods, including the technology of baseline reality. All organisms and bodies of water in SCP-CN-1997 are considered to be lethal to baseline humans due to the degree of radiation sustained.

SCP-CN-1997 is constantly approaching the baseline universe on the phase plane level, causing repeated EVE waves and reality shocks in the baseline universe. As the phase interference between the baseline universe and SCP-CN-1997 could incur a [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/universal-collision|Öß-Class &#34;Multi-Universal Amalgamation&#34; scenario]]], SCP-CN-1997 was initially classified Keter. However, as the mutual approach of SCP-CN-1997 and the baseline universe was suddenly stopped on 1973/10/10, following which the interference also stopped, SCP-CN-1997 was reclassified Euclid. The Dimensional Research Department soon detected the presence of SCP-CN-1997-1, and determined that its presence was preventing SCP-CN-1997 from further approaching the baseline universe.

SCP-CN-1997-1 is a small-scale extradimensional space located between the baseline universe and SCP-CN-1997 on the phase plane level, overlapping Hong Kong, China in the baseline universe in terms of physical location, and can be accessed by various entrances located throughout the Kowloon Peninsula and the New Territories area[[footnote]]The Foundation currently has control over six of these entrances; most other entrances are under control of the Hong Kong Government, with the exception of a few undiscovered locations.[[/footnote]]. SCP-CN-1997-1&#39;s geographical environment is identical to that of Hong Kong, but the direction of the magnetic field is rotated 90 degrees to point west. Most currently known entrances to SCP-CN-1997 are located in the east of SCP-CN-1997-1[[footnote]]Corresponding to Hong Kong Island and Lantau Island in the baseline universe.[[/footnote]]. More information about SCP-CN-1997-1 can be found in Addendum 4.

SCP-CN-1997-1 has currently been confirmed to be the cause of the cessation of interference between SCP-CN-1997 and the baseline universe; on the phase plane level, SCP-CN-1997-1 repels both the baseline universe and SCP-CN-1997, preventing their mutual approach. As such, in order to prevent further interference, the maintenance of SCP-CN-1997-1&#39;s structural stability has been made the main focus of Foundation containment of SCP-CN-1997.

&gt; SCP-CN-1997 was initially discovered in 1970 by the Foundation and the GOC. At the time, monitoring personnel of one of the member organizations of the GOC, the International Center for the Study of Unified Thaumatology (ICSUT), reported that EVE waves had been emerging and steadily growing stronger in the Guangdong area of China beginning in 1950 and had exceeded an alert threshold in 1970. The report was brought to the Foundation&#39;s attention at the information sharing session that year.
&gt; 
&gt; The same year, Dr. Philip of the Foundation&#39;s Dimensional Research Department (DRD) discovered a large anomalous space approaching the baseline universe on the phase plane level while conducting routine high-phase observation. Further investigation by the DRD revealed that the high latent EVE levels in this space was causing significant effects on the baseline universe, correlating with the EVE waves occurring in the past twenty years. It was also estimated that this space would make contact with the baseline universe on the phase plane level in three years. This anomalous space was designated SCP-CN-1997, a Keter-class anomaly.
&gt; 
&gt; In order to prevent the worst-case scenario, the Foundation quickly contacted the GOC, looking to work together in responding to the impending crisis. In 1971, the ICSUT and the DRD jointly released the &#34;Tremolo&#34; program, which could slow the approach of SCP-CN-1997 and the baseline universe towards each other. 
&gt; 
&gt; The &#34;Tremolo&#34; program successfully delayed the collision of SCP-CN-1997 and the baseline universe to late 1981, but created continued fluctuations in Hume levels throughout China, especially Guangdong. According to the DRD, over 60 anomalies currently registered in the Foundation database, including high-risk SCPs such as [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/SCP-CN-078|SCP-CN-078]]] and [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/SCP-CN-475|SCP-CN-475]]], are byproducts of the &#34;Tremolo&#34; program.
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-CN-1997 stopped its approach on the phase plane level with no warning on 10 October 1973. The interference between SCP-CN-1997 and baseline reality also subsided to acceptable levels within the next two months. Subsequent high-phase observations by the DRD revealed the existence of SCP-CN-1997-1; this small spatial anomaly was located in the very center of the phase collision, &#34;connecting&#34; SCP-CN-1997 and the baseline universe and stopping their mutual approach. As the balance between SCP-CN-1997 and the baseline universe quickly stabilized, SCP-CN-1997 was reclassified Euclid on 1 January 1974, and the Foundation began sending exploration teams into SCP-CN-1997-1 that year to understand the situation in SCP-CN-1997-1 and SCP-1997-1[[footnote]]Owing to suppression from the Republic&#39;s government, the GOC did not organize exploration teams to enter SCP-CN-1997.[[/footnote]].
&gt; 
&gt; The Foundation&#39;s exploration team met with GoI-1997, the &#34;Zhujihui&#34;, on March 26 the same year, successfully establishing dialogue and producing the first version of the &#34;Two Phases Agreement&#34;. Further information on this agreement can be found in Addendum 5.
&gt; 
&gt; Due to the Two Phases Agreement, the Foundation has refrained from interference in SCP-CN-1997 and SCP-CN-1997-1, with the exception of the bare minimum of monitoring. Currently, the Two Phases Agreement has only been amended twice:
&gt; 
&gt; The first amendment occurred in December 1997. At the time, SCP-CN-1997-1 had suffered unrest due to riots caused by local anartists in September, paralyzing local law enforcement and causing major vibrations in the external structure of SCP-CN-1997-1. According to the amended agreement, SCP-CN-1997-1&#39;s law enforcement shall come from law enforcement organizations of the baseline universe and SCP-CN-1997. As such, the Hong Kong Police Force created the Hong Shing Police Division, drawing its initial membership from Site-CN-71 and the Chinese &#34;Relevant Group&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; The second amendment occurred in July 2010, when SCP-CN-1997-1&#39;s population density began to cause societal issues and the concentrated use of thaumatological, paratechnological and anomalous techniques caused Hume levels within SCP-CN-1997-1 to increase rapidly. This had caused a hole in the border surrounding SCP-CN-1997-1 in May the same year. Despite the fact that the Foundation and Zhujihui had filled the hole with the help of several relevant organizations, it was decided that the Two Phases Agreement was to be amended to prevent further occurrences of the incident. In accordance with the new agreement, 16 anomalous organizations active within SCP-CN-1997-1 formed the &#34;Sky Wall Maintenance Committee&#34;, with the sole goal of maintaining the stability of SCP-CN-1997-1&#39;s reality and phase structure; in addition, the Foundation and Zhujihui began official operations within SCP-CN-1997-1, forcibly removing any anomalous threats to SCP-CN-1997-1.

The effect can last from one hour to three days. || The Zhujihui&#39;s task forces use this as standard procedure; according to the materials provided by the Zhujihui, they previously held a variant of this technique closer to SCP-CN-404 that could have been weaponized as &#34;sensory disruption&#34;, but the original information was lost in an attack by a hostile organization. ||
|| [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/SCP-CN-475|SCP-CN-475]]] || A ritual-type funeral thaumaturgy known as &#34;creation of tomb&#34;; the ritual is a request from the &#34;God of Death and Eternal Life&#34;, which uses the corpse or remnants of the dead as a medium to make known the name and year of birth and death of the deceased, as well as gather the remnants of the deceased within a certain radius, to create a tomb with the name and year of birth and death of the deceased inscribed. The ritual requires complete darkness, and the ritual location must not have excessive &#34;presence of the living&#34;. || Widely used for funerals by the SCP-CN-1997 religious group &#34;Church of Bright&#34;; according to the church members, the ritual must be routinely carried out to avoid the wrath of the Gods being placed on the living. _
After the Foundation began to carry out this ritual in the baseline universe, SCP-CN-475&#39;s rate of occurrence has been effectively controlled; affected subjects primarily became Foundation agents who had died in the line of duty. A request to re-classify SCP-CN-475 as Euclid has been made.||
|| [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/SCP-CN-440|SCP-CN-440]]] || An alchemy-type spirit thaumaturgy &#34;insertion of soul&#34;, which inserts a spirit of the recently deceased into an object, preserving the spirit&#39;s memories, personality and abilities. Following this, divine energy can be used to program the soul within the object, bringing out various capabilities in the possessed object. _
It is possible to insert more than one spirit, but the spirits&#39; personalities must match to prevent mutual rejection. || Widely used by various secret organizations, including the Zhujihui; due to legal restrictions set by world governments, it has not become common among civilians. _
It has been confirmed that SCP-CN-440 was created with this technique; the Foundation, with the help of the Zhujihui, has allowed the informational entities (SCP-CN-440-1 through -5) to be freed. SCP-CN-440 has been reclassified Neutralized. ||
|| [[[SCP-CN-757]]] || A border-type thaumaturgy known as &#34;spatial expansion&#34; allows for the user to dramatically expand the internal volume of a sealed room by perturbing the space with divine energy. The expanded space can be modified to a certain degree in accordance with the user&#39;s wishes, such as by modifying the shape of the expanded space, setting certain physical laws within the space, and preventing certain people from entering or leaving. || The Zhujihui uses this thaumaturgy in their &#34;scholarly towers&#34;, which are research and containment facilities; further information has not been obtained as the Zhujihui deems them highly secret. _
From currently known information, the spatial anomaly in the interior of SCP-CN-757 uses this form of thaumaturgy. It is currently being investigated as to whether Letters Entertainment has any connections to SCP-CN-1997 or the Zhujihui. ||
||[[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/SCP-CN-805|SCP-CN-805]]] || An alchemy-type thaumaturgy known as &#34;creation of multitome&#34; allows programs to be written in ink that has absorbed divine energy onto paper made of specific materials, then bound into a book using a simple ritual. The gemstone embedded in the cover of the tome can then be used as a source of power to activate the spells in the book, drawing on the user&#39;s own divine energy when needed. _
Due to the insufficient capacity and output of the gemstone, most of the spells in common &#34;multitomes&#34; are utility spells used for communication, word processing, maps, etc.; there are also games programmed using divine energy. || &#34;Multitomes&#34; are commonly used in SCP-CN-1997 and has the function of a notebook computer or tablet.  _
Analysis of SCP-CN-805-1 through SCP-CN-805-5 shows that the cards&#39; material is identical to those used in &#34;multitomes&#34;, and further testing confirmed that they could be used as pages of &#34;multitomes&#34; and could be triggered with the divine energy present in a &#34;multitome&#34;. It is suggested that SCP-CN-805-6 was created due to the lack of usable &#34;multitomes&#34;, and is meant to be a substitute to activate these spells in a ritual setting. ||

Divine energy within a certain radius of the metal is neutralized and cannot be manipulated, rendering implements created with SCP-CN-1997&#39;s thaumaturgical technology inoperable. In addition, long-term exposure to the metal will result in slow loss of cognitive ability and replication of the metal. || Contained by the Zhujihui as &#34;SCP-3148&#34;.

According to deployment records from the Zhujihui, Prometheus Group used this metal to create various types of anti-divine-energy device, including an &#34;anti-air device&#34; that could paralyze all forms of divine-energy-based flight, an &#34;anti-divine-energy armor&#34; immune to all forms of divine-energy-based attack, and a &#34;fatal bullet&#34; that could nullify the gift of regeneration and all thaumaturgy.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Addendum 4&#34; hide=&#34;- Addendum 4: Records Relating to SCP-CN-1997-1 “Hong Shing”&#34;]]
[[tabview]]
[[tab Overview]]
**Overview**
&gt; Hong Shing (designated SCP-CN-1997-1) is a small-scale spatial anomaly located directly overlapping Hong Kong in the baseline universe and Hong Gong Islands in SCP-CN-1997 on the physical plane, and between the baseline universe and SCP-CN-1997 on the phase plane. It is a self-governing city recognized by both the People&#39;s Republic of China and the United State of A Mary King. Hong Shing&#39;s political system uses a council system; councils are formed from official and civilian representatives to manage Hong Shing&#39;s governance, legislation and judicial matters; the actual enforcement of law is carried out jointly by the People&#39;s Republic of China and the United State of A Mary King.
&gt; 
&gt; The entire Hong Shing area consists of over 5000 km^^2^^ of freshwater ocean and around 1100 km^^2^^ of land area, comprising 264 islands of varying size. The positioning of the islands matches between Hong Kong in the baseline universe, Hong Gong in SCP-CN-1997, and Hong Shing. However, due to the influence of phase magnetic fields from two parallel realities, the magnetic field is rotated 90 degrees towards the west, causing the map of Hong Shing to differ significantly from that of Hong Kong and Hong Gong Islands.

&gt; SCP-CN-1997-1 district map, provided by the Sky Wall Maintenance Committee.
&gt; [[/div]]
&gt; [[/div]]
&gt; Hong Shing is simultaneously illuminated by both the sun in the baseline universe and the sun in SCP-CN-1997; this leads to it being day on one side and night on the other within Hong Shing. In addition, the central part of Hong Shing is illuminated by both suns, meaning it is always day there. The area of Hong Shing is divided into a East District, a West District and a Central District; of these areas, the Mang Kok city area in the eastern part of the Central District[[footnote]]geographically overlapping a part of Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei in Kowloon[[/footnote]] is the most developed. As of July 2020, the population of Hong Shing is 250,000.
&gt; 
&gt; The border of Hong Shing is enclosed by a 2-meter-thick spherical border wall with a diameter estimated at 80 km, referred to by residents as the &#34;Sky Wall&#34;. The Sky Wall&#39;s existence allows the structure of reality in Hong Shing to remain stable, and is the primary reason preventing the collision of the baseline universe and SCP-CN-1997. As the maintenance of the Sky Wall is the most important objective of each meeting of the Hong Shing Council, the &#34;Sky Wall Maintenance Committee&#34; was established in 2010 in order to carry out daily maintenance and repair of the Sky Wall.
&gt; 
&gt; Hong Shing stably links the baseline universe and the developed thaumaturgical civilization of SCP-CN-1997 together, meaning Hong Shing has become one of the most active sites for anomalous activity, relying on an environment in which developed, safe paratechnology and thaumaturgy can be exchanged and many excellent and a well-rounded anomalous education system to make its name heard in the global anomalous community.

**History**
&gt; In late 1973, this spatial anomaly suddenly appeared between the baseline universe and SCP-CN-1997, putting a stop to the danger posed by their mutual approach. As such, the Foundation sent an exploration team into the new spatial anomaly, designated SCP-CN-1997-1, making contact with a Group of Interest originating within SCP-CN-1997, the Zhujihui, designated GoI-1997. Following exchanges, both parties agreed to cooperate in maintaining the existence of SCP-CN-1997-1, signing the &#34;Two Phases Agreement&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; Following this, the United State of A Mary King, a country within SCP-CN-1997, entered SCP-CN-1997-1 and established a consensus with minority groups who had entered SCP-CN-1997-1 following its founding, creating the Hong Shing Autonomous City and establishing the council system; following this, residents entered from SCP-CN-1997 in large numbers. At the same time, as Chinese anomalous society was influenced by the shock of the Cultural Revolution, many members of the anomalous community fled to Hong Shing to avoid troubles. The establishment of the Autonomous City and the influx of asylum-seekers from the baseline universe led to rapid development in Hong Shing.
&gt; 
&gt; However, the unique environment of Hong Shing also led to conflict between those who came from the baseline universe and those who came from SCP-CN-1997. The A Mary King government&#39;s preferential treatment of those coming from SCP-CN-1997 caused further conflict, eventually leading to the &#34;Two Schools&#39; Rivalry[[footnote]] Occurring in 1992, the Two Schools&#39; Rivalry was a series of conflicts between St. Christina College, a Group of Interest from the baseline universe that entered Hong Shing the year before, and Hang Tan College, a Group of Interest from SCP-CN-1997 that had entered Hong Shing shortly after the establishment of the Autonomous City; following several instances of hidden warfare, the two parties came to an agreement and relations eventually warmed. Following this, Hang Tan College rebranded to &#34;Hong  Shing Hang Tan College&#34;, and cut relations with A Mary King and even the whole of SCP-CN-1997.[[/footnote]]&#34; and the &#34;Sky Wall Painter Riot[[footnote]] Occurring in 1997, the Sky Wall Painter Riot occurred when a group of artists who often produced works on the Sky Wall expressed dissatisfaction with the A Mary King government&#39;s discriminatory legislature against artists from the baseline phase in a protest; the A Mary King Unusual Incidents Unit failed to subdue the protest, causing it to turn into a full-scale riot. The incident caused severe casualties among the civilian population and economic losses; A Mary King enforcement units responsible for maintaining order suffered heavy casualties and their headquarters were destroyed. In addition, the Sky Wall border suffered heavy damage from thaumaturgical attacks. The incident concluded with the intervention of the A Mary King president, which allowed the situation to calm.[[/footnote]]&#34; occurred in 1992 and 1997 respectively; the &#34;Sky Wall Painter Riot&#34; caused a complete loss of the ability for A Mary King law enforcement personnel to be active in Hong Shing. In addition, the Sky Wall suffered severe damage; as a result, the Foundation drafted the first amendment to the &#34;Two Phases Agreement&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; The &#34;Sky Wall Painter Riot&#34; attracted the attention of the People&#39;s Republic of China of the baseline reality, and in 1998 the Chinese government entered the scene with the goal of protecting its people. Following extensive discussion, representatives from the People&#39;s Republic entered the Hong Shing Council, and Hong Shing&#39;s autonomous city status was now protected by both China and A Mary King. The same year, Hong Kong (China), Hong Shing and Hong Gong (A Mary King) officially became partner cities, joining the &#34;Community of Alternate Phase Cities of Hong Gong&#34; and signing the &#34;Two Phases Urban Information Agreement&#34; and other agreements. The above developments led to the resolution of many conflicts between the people, and Hong Shing became a friendlier, safer community for anomalous technology exchange and became more and more well known in anomalous communities in both the baseline universe and SCP-CN-1997.
&gt; 
&gt; However, Hong Shing&#39;s rapid increase in population and use of anomalous technology also led to various kinds of societal problems; the latter also led to an increase in Hume levels in various areas of Hong Shing. This led to the &#34;Sky Hole Crisis&#34; occurring in May of 2010, during which many Groups of Interest active in Hong Shing worked together effectively to fill the gap in the Sky Wall that had opened, reducing loss of life and economic damage. The &#34;Sky Hole Crisis&#34; also encouraged the Foundation to begin publicly operating in Hong Shing, which was formalized in the second amendment to the &#34;Two Phases Agreement&#34; in July the same year. In addition, the &#34;Sky Wall Maintenance Committee&#34;, composed of specialists from the Foundation and other Groups of Interest, was also established in August that year to prevent similar incidents from occurring.

[[tab Known Entrances (Excerpt)]]
&gt; As of 2010, there are 97 entrances to SCP-CN-1997-1 known, of which 17 are unusable for various reasons, 6 are controlled by the Foundation, 8 are controlled by the Zhujihui, and 4 are controlled by other Groups of Interest; the rest are managed by the Hong Kong Government or the government of A Mary King.
&gt; 
&gt; The Foundation has given designations to each entrance; the first letter indicates whether the entrance is from the baseline universe (L), SCP-CN-1997 (R), or neither (X).

**Designation:**GoI-1997, &#34;[[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]Zhujihui[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]Foundation Society[[/span]][[/span]]&#34;
**Membership:** Currently known to have at least 3000 members[[footnote]]Data is limited to members in SCP-CN-1997-1 and SCP-CN-1997&#39;s Yueguang State (equivalent to Guangdong Province in the baseline universe); no data for members in other areas has been gathered.[[/footnote]]
**Resources:** Unknown
**Status:** --Dormant-- Active

**Description and History:** The Zhujihui was one of the largest secret organizations in SCP-CN-1997; according to currently obtainable information, it is a version of the Foundation from another world -- more precisely, it is the Foundation&#39;s successors. The Zhujihui&#39;s origins have already been lost; however, the earliest mention of the Zhujihui can within SCP-CN-1997 has been traced to [[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]4026 AtG[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]1789 AD[[/span]][[/span]] (After the Gods). It has also been confirmed that the Zhujihui was a primary force in bringing SCP-CN-1997 civilization out of a potential EK-Class Civilizational Regression [[footnote]] An end-of-the-world scenario in which a resource critical for human civilization is exhausted, leading to a regression. -- //List of Defined End-of-the-World Scenarios: Civilizational//; Emu. H et al., //Foundation//, Vol. 98.2, pp 25-40, 1980.[[/footnote]] Scenario. When first contact was made with the Zhujihui, the Zhujihui had suffered heavy losses from enemy attacks and the construction of SCP-CN-1997-1, and was intending to enter a dormant state. As the Zhujihui&#39;s survival was necessary to ensure the continued existence of SCP-CN-1997-1, the Foundation established a collaborative relationship with the Zhujihui and in order to aid the development of SCP-CN-1997-1 signed the &#34;Two Phases Agreement&#34;.

The information gathered shows the Zhujihui&#39;s prior manner of action can be understood as a poor imitation of the mission of the Foundation; they collected anomalous objects from structures left behind from the &#34;era of the gods&#34;, and used the partial information they gathered there to contain them in their &#34;scholarly towers&#34;. The largest difference between the Zhujihui and the Foundation is that the Zhujihui does not operate behind a veil; in addition, in order to simply and quickly bring anomalies into containment, they will often resort to extreme and irresponsible measures. This led to them making many enemies, and suffering attacks from various countries and organizations.

In [[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]4186 AtG[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]1949 CE[[/span]][[/span]], the Zhujihui used a large-scale ritual-type thaumaturgy in a [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/floor-of-lava-that-melting-the-base|reckless operation]]], causing an entire large settlement to be destroyed and causing a large number of civilian casualties. This led to the Zhujihui suffering retribution and reputational damage from other countries and organizations within SCP-CN-1997. At the same time, the large-scale ritual-type thaumaturgy caused the whole of SCP-CN-1997 to begin moving on the phase plane, causing it to begin colliding with the baseline universe. This incident, referred to within SCP-CN-1997 as the &#34;Perishing of Machinery and Cogwork&#34;, led to a schism in the Zhujihui five years later, with a group known as the &#34;Gravediggers&#34; splitting off from the Zhujihui and joining the anti-Zhujihui forces. This led to a massive reduction in the influence of the Zhujihui.

In [[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]4210 AtG[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]1973 CE[[/span]][[/span]], a massive change occurred in the Zhujihui; the original management of the Zhujihui was expelled and replaced by a group of [[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]scholars[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]researchers[[/span]][[/span]] who had obtained the &#34;[[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/truth-legacy|Legacy of the Gods]]]&#34;. They gathered the Zhujihui&#39;s remaining strength and created an extradimensional space on the phase plane, putting a stop to the mutual approach of SCP-CN-1997 and the baseline universe and connecting them. Following this, the Zhujihui hid in this space, known as [[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]Hong Shing[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]SCP-CN-1997-1[[/span]][[/span]], and entered a dormant state.

The Foundation first made contact with the Zhujihui in 1974, signing the &#34;Two Phases Agreement&#34; with the Zhujihui, the protectors of SCP-CN-1997-1; following this, the Zhujihui has returned to their mission as protectors under the guidance and support of the Foundation, gaining a well-deserved period of rest.

The current Zhujihui, with its newfound influence, has re-expanded to the whole area of the United State of A Mary King in SCP-CN-1997, and has adopted a manner of operation similar to the modern Foundation; it is also one of the signatories to the second amendment of the &#34;Two Phases Agreement&#34; and one of the first parties to the &#34;Sky Wall Maintenance Committee&#34;.

[[tab Interview Log 19740326]]
&gt; **Interviewee:** High-ranking member of GoI-1997, Esteemed Scholar Mea Scarlet
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** MTF Tau-15 commander, Frenda Ravenholdt
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** On January 1, 1974, the Foundation&#39;s Dimensional Research Department discovered the existence of SCP-CN-1997-1 when investigating the reason SCP-CN-1997&#39;s approach had stopped, and discovered many entrances to SCP-CN-1997-1 in British-ruled Hong Kong.  After confirming that SCP-CN-1997-1 was spatially stable, Site-906, located nearby, sent out Mobile Task Force Tau-15 &#34;Crown Jewels&#34; to enter SCP-CN-1997-1 for exploration. The Mobile Task Force was fired upon by GoI-1997 agents within; while both sides were unharmed, the entire Mobile Task Force was brought to their tower and detained. The leader of this tower, Esteemed Scholar Mea Scarlet, requested to speak with the leader of the Task Force, Frenda Ravenholdt. The following is the log of this interview.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Recording&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** Hello, Ms... Fr... Fu... lan... da. First of all, I would like to welcome you to our scholarly tower. I am the master of this tower, Esteemed Scholar of the Zhujihui, Mea Scarlet. Please forgive our brash actions prior, we come on friendly terms. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** Frenda. It&#39;s pronounced Frenda. Don&#39;t worry, we do not regard you as enemies for what you did. In fact, we are very amazed to see your equipment and thaumaturgical techniques... I have to say, I feel like I&#39;ve been dropped in one of those fantasy novels.
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** You&#39;re too kind. Your magical powers have been eye-opening for me. I have fought with magicians before, and none have been as impressive as you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** Us? Magicians?
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** Yes, magicians. Just as you see our technology and divine techniques as &#34;thaumaturgy&#34;, we in this phase call what you use &#34;magic&#34;, and contain it as an anomaly.
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:**Anomaly? Do you also have a &#34;veil protocol&#34;... I mean, are you an organization that hides the anomalous from the public?
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** I regret to say it, but we are not that kind of organization. We secure, we contain, but we have not protected anything. The kind of organization you speak of, I believe you are referring to one that existed when the gods still walked the world, yes? But they have long fallen into the twilight, leaving behind only the dawn of mankind, and we who play their role, in the ruins they left behind.
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** Secure... contain... that organization you mentioned, what was it called? Could it be...
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** That name was in the language of the gods, and we had initially translated it as [[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]that on which something is built[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]Zhujihui[[/span]][[/span]], which is the name of our organization. But now, we know its true meaning. In the language of the gods, it is called the &#34;Foundation&#34;, and in the common tongue it means &#34;that which is founded&#34;. We translated it correctly, right, combatant of the Foundation, miss from the magical civilization of the Left Phase?
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** So you knew of us long ago...
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** I could tell from the symbols on your uniforms. This symbol has always been regarded as a sigil of the gods here. Regardless of how, it is remarkable that we can see a &#34;god&#34; in the flesh, even if you come from another world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** D-don&#39;t refer to us that way. It&#39;s too strange to call us by a name like &#34;gods&#34;. But, Esteemed Scholar, you are continuing the work of the Foundation in your world, yes? Why have you secured and contained, but not protected?
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** No, no. You and the gods of our world, who have already been lost, are two different things. That we can understand. But as for your question, I would like to clear things up. The Zhujihui is not the successor of the Foundation -- we have only adopted their ways, but the current Zhujihui is but a poor imitation of the Foundation: Secure, but by stealing from others; Contain, but not knowing how; and Protect? Hah, we destroyed an entire city to obtain some anomalies. The Zhujihui was once the most powerful secret organization, their scholarly towers covering the whole world, containing the most anomalies out of any, and their scholars and combatants were the cream of the crop. But now? We hide in this little space that we opened, weak and struggling! Because the Zhujihui is just a poor imitation!
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** Wait! This space was opened by your people? Do you know what this space means to all of us?
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** I know, of course I know. We used the lives of all thirteen Sages, many Esteemed Scholars, and hundreds of ordinary scholars; precious materials built up over countless years, more than ten anomalous objects capable of creating spatial anomalies to create this special location. It is the redemption of the Zhujihui, putting into practice the ideals of the Foundation, and the first step on a process that will allow the Zhujihui to rise like a phoenix from the ashes. From the very  beginning, this space was made to save the Zhujihui and our two worlds!
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** ... I would like to thank you, in my capacity as a representative of the Foundation, for saving our world. But why did you make this decision?
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** There is no need to thank us. You have no reason to. As for our reasoning, it would be too much trouble to explain it; perhaps you are not very familiar with what we have done in the Right Phase. If you go there, you will understand, perhaps, and then we can discuss.
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** Is that to say you will let us go? Are you not scared that we will suddenly go against you?
&gt;   
&gt; **Scarlet:** We are not. Whether you wish to maintain the existence of this space, or use it as a base from which to explore the world before you, you need our willing cooperation -- divine energy to you is like the nectar of the gods, but to you may not be. I believe, if we want to maintain this space, we need your cooperation -- and cooperation begins with mutual understanding. Wouldn&#39;t you agree?
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** Alright... I know, when we come back, we&#39;ll find you again.
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** That&#39;s wonderful. I feel we will have further chances to cooperate in future, but of course we need your cooperation. Please, continue your journey. I would like to give you some advice as a parting gift: Don&#39;t use your magic on the other side. The A Mary King people are very against it.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Recording&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** Following the interview, the task force was released from GoI-1997&#39;s tower and given thaumaturgical equipment that could protect them from SCP-CN-1997&#39;s high-radiation environment, as well as clothing that allowed them to fit into SCP-CN-1997 society. After this was reported, it was approved for the Mobile Task Force to continue exploration of SCP-CN-1997-1 and SCP-CN-1997.

&gt; **Interviewee:** High-ranking member of GoI-1997, Esteemed Scholar Mea Scarlet
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** MTF Tau-15 commander, Frenda Ravenholdt
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** On April 6, 1974, Mobile Task Force Tau-15 completed initial exploration of SCP-CN-1997-1, and entered SCP-CN-1997 through SCP-CN-1997-1-R8 in the East District for initial exploration[[footnote]]Exploration logs and recovered materials have been archived to the relevant documents&#39; addenda; initial documents are classified 5/CN-1997.[[/footnote]]. Initial exploration lasted for a month, and all targets were successfully achieved. As during the exploration Tau-15 suffered heavy personnel losses, they were recalled to Site-906 for recuperation. As agreed in the previous interview, it was approved for Commander Frenda Ravenholdt to seek out Esteemed Scholar Mea Scarlet for a second interview at GoI-1997&#39;s scholarly tower. The following is the log of this interview.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Recording&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** Welcome back, Ms Frenda. Judging from your appearance, I take it you had some trouble in the Right Phase?
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** We had some trouble with Prometheus La... I mean, Group. But most of us survived.
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** Prometheus, you mean those gangster magicians? We have been attacked by them before. A very troublesome opponent, to be sure. So, you&#39;ve been there for a month; what do you think about it? What do you think about us?
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** How do I say it... It was like I&#39;d walked right into a modern fantasy novel. A lot of things have counterparts in our world, but how they work is another matter entirely. We were like a green flower in a field of grass -- we look similar, but different, and in the end we stand out. We have to thank you for the clothing you provided - if not for it, we&#39;d have been discovered the second we walked into the city. It helped us achieve our objective.
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** No need to thank us. While you were exploring our Phase, we explored yours. I think you hit it right on the mark. And, what about us? Have you heard of any of our achievements?
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** All negative... &#34;Thieves pretending to be spokespeople of the gods&#34;, &#34;plunderer of divine objects&#34;, &#34;evil spirit of the era of the gods&#34;, &#34;blasphemers against the gods, soaked in the blood of innocents&#34;... all to do with the gods!
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** Let me guess, most of those are probably ones you heard from the Gravediggers, those traitors? They have always considered themselves the true spokespeople of the gods. But they are correct about us. The Zhujihui of old was truly just a group of thieves, stealing divine implements, even if we thieves were the strongest of them all. Ms Frenda, I must ask, what do you do when you discover anomalies? What if they are in the hands of other groups?
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** Um... that depends on the situation. If it&#39;s in the middle of nowhere or an object that has no owner, we just collect it; if there&#39;s people around or the object is under someone&#39;s ownership, then things get more complicated. We need to cover up the incident, amnesticize, give reimbursements... basically, we need to minimize the damage to the veil. If the object is in another group&#39;s hands, that&#39;s even more trouble. If we can interfere, we interfere; if the object is dangerous in their hands, we take it from them; if the item won&#39;t cause much harm to the world or the veil, we let them keep it. Let&#39;s just put it this way, we get a lot of threats from other organizations asking us to give them back their things, and sometimes it comes to raids. If you think about it, we too really are just thieves.
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** No. I may not be so sure if the Foundation you speak of is in its truest form. But even though you may be embellishing it a little, it is still a lot better than the Zhujihui by miles. Don&#39;t you know? Though you see the Foundation as acting like thieves, your intentions are pure. You have something that we didn&#39;t have at the start.
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** Something you didn&#39;t have? ... Ah! &#34;We secure, we contain, but...&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** But we have not protected. Since the Zhujihui was founded, up until now, it was always like this. Since centuries ago, when our founders discovered the source of divine energy in a divine ruin, it has always been like this. ... Do you mind if I tell a story?
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** Of course not. We are very interested in your history. Just as you said, &#34;mutual understanding&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet：** Thank you. Our founders, the &#34;foundation-builders&#34;, discovered a source of divine energy in a divine ruin. Not only that, they found many dangerous divine implements and fragments of information. They followed the information they found, fumbling in the dark, until they could contain these divine implements. After that, they activated this source of divine energy, which they called a solar furnace, and restored the divine energy that had been dried up to the surrounding area. After that, they searched all over for these divine ruins, collecting the divine implements that had been left there, and activating the solar furnaces, bringing divine energy back to the world. Their selfless generosity led to the discovery of a way to stably create divine energy, allowing the world to recover from the thaumaturgical doomsday. In the end, the foundation-builders followed the information from the era of the gods that they had gathered and set up an organization to explore divine ruins and collect divine implements. They used their superficial knowledge of the language of the gods to translate the most common noun in these documents to be the name of their organization. That is how the Zhujihui came to be.
&gt; 
&gt; The Zhujihui and their successors claim to be the &#34;spokespeople of the era of the gods&#34;, as they gathered more information from each of the divine ruins, they set their sights on divine implements in the hands of civilians and other organizations. In terms of method, they were far more ruthless than you: breaking and entering, killing those who resisted, picking up the divine implements and just walking off. The Zhujihui&#39;s combatants and task forces were all for doing this. Of course, doing these kinds of things has consequences, but the Zhujihui had too much power from their magical and divine technologies, and too many people, so most people would hate us, but not act on it.
&gt; 
&gt; Up until 25 years ago, the Zhujihui continued in this blasphemy. You have already mentioned what they called us, Ms. Frenda.
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** Yes, they all said the Zhujihui had gone against the gods, causing the &#34;Perishing of Machinery and Cogwork&#34;, stained themselves in the innocent believers&#39; blood. They said you were liars and cheats, posing as the spokespeople of the gods.
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** What they say is correct. That tragedy was caused by our arrogance and fervor in wanting to contain all divine implements. That time, our Esteemed Scholars found information relating to some divine implements. But those divine implements were parts of the Protector Giant of the Holy City of Gears. Here&#39;s the question, miss, if it were you, how would you deal with a Giant of Gears, made of various anomalous components and protecting the civilians of a city, whose effects would never leave the city&#39;s vicinity?
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** Um... first of all, we&#39;d see whether it can pose harm? If it could, we would find a way to stop it, then take it apart. If not, we don&#39;t really need to intervene -- the city needs to be isolated and kept behind the veil, so that nobody outside knows the existence of this giant mechanical contraption; even though the people inside know, it doesn&#39;t really need any dealing with. If it has means of communication with the outside world, we do something to make people from the outside not know of its existence, like, um, a cognitohazard? ... Hold on, I&#39;m only an MTF member, why do I need to help you contain some machinery? Isn&#39;t this the job of a containment specialist?
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** Ha ha... because we were in that situation in the past. Madam, your way of thinking is very good, but when we tried to obtain the divine implements inside, we took the easiest, most direct method: we set up a large ritual and just bombed the giant with sunlight.
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** What?! You just bombed it...
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** To use your magical terms for it, it was a [[span class=&#34;ruby&#34;]]divine energy explosive[[span class=&#34;rt&#34;]]nuclear warhead[[/span]][[/span]]. We broke the giant apart with the sunlight, but the heat produced caused thirty thousand people, the whole population of the city, to perish. And it caused an unexpected trouble for us -- that we will discuss later.
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** That&#39;s... horrible...
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** Yes, it&#39;s horrible, but in the eyes of the leaders of the Zhujihui of that time, the divine implements left behind in that giant beast were more important. But the Holy City of Gears was the most important holy site of the Church of Gears. In the eyes of we who revere the gods, the Zhujihui had gone against the very gods they claimed to represent. And because of this, the Zhujihui&#39;s image was not just tarnished, but destroyed., and many scholarly towers were destroyed by the angered people. There were even some people within the Zhujihui who defected, calling themselves the Zhujihui&#39;s &#34;gravediggers&#34;. Hah, in just a few years, that monster was left with nowhere to go by its own arrogance and rudeness.
&gt; 
&gt; [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/truth-legacy|At this point, we discovered the true legacy of the gods.]]]
&gt; 
&gt; I know you want to ask what it is. But yes, it is the legacy left behind from the era of the gods, by the god who called himself O5-6 -- oh, you seem to recognize that designation.
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** I... I can&#39;t explain it to you in too much depth... but this is similar to the designation our highest leaders use.
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** I understand... he left behind detailed information, everything about this organization from the era of the gods, called the &#34;Foundation&#34;. At that time, I... no, //we// discovered the true meaning of what we had translated as &#34;Zhujihui&#34;. And the most important part of this information was the mission this prior organization&#39;s [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/about-the-scp-foundation|mission]]].
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** To secure, contain and protect...
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** That&#39;s right, these three words moved our superiors. Thinking back to our original actions, it surely wasn&#39;t that we only knew to secure, to contain, but not to protect. So I took that &#34;legacy&#34; from him, and sent it around to the scholars who I could trust...
&gt; 
&gt; ... and soon the winds of change started to blow. We chased out the Sages&#39; Council that had become entrenched in their old ways, and replaced them with our Esteemed Scholars who had seen the truth. Wonderful, wonderful... if only.
&gt; 
&gt; At this time, an Esteemed Scholar who specialized in spatial thaumaturgy discovered a great bother. That sunlight-attack we used was so powerful that it had shifted our world on some higher dimension, and sent it right into another world; if not for the efforts of the other side that slowed down the speed of collision, we who had not begun our revolution would have perished with the other universe. After that, well, you know the rest -- we established this space.
&gt; 
&gt; So you have no reason to thank us for these things. It is all what we have done to ourselves, and this atonement is all too late. No, rather the opposite -- we would like to thank //you// for this chance to redeem ourselves. The sacrifice you have made is more deserving of thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; **Frenda:** Likewise, you have no reason to thank us. We don&#39;t know how what exactly our people did, but I can be sure it was all in the name of self-preservation.
&gt; 
&gt; **Scarlet:** Isn&#39;t this what your Foundation does? To protect the people, protect the world. In the Foundation&#39;s motto, &#34;Protect&#34; is the most important part -- it is the true objective of securing and containing. We in the past, we did not know. Only now do we know.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you, Ms Frenda, you can take your recording device and leave. And please, pass on our request to cooperate with your superiors. This space&#39;s existence cannot be maintained by us alone. Only with the two sides&#39; cooperation can we maintain this bridge and pillar between our worlds.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Recording&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** Commander Frenda returned to Site-906 after the interview and passed Esteemed Scholar Scarlet&#39;s request to the Site Director. On May 10, 1974, Site-906 director Dr. Lockhart Patten was authorized to represent the Foundation and proceed into SCP-CN-1997-1, following which a three-day discussion occurred with GoI-1997&#39;s leader Esteemed Scholar Mea Scarlet. On May 15, the &#34;Two Phases Agreement&#34; was signed.

[[tab Overview]]
The &#34;Two Phases Agreement&#34; is an agreement signed between the Foundation and GoI-1997 &#34;Zhujihui&#34; starting on May 10, 1974 with the objective of ensuring the continued existence of SCP-CN-1997-1 on the phase plane, allowing it to stably maintain the balance between the baseline universe and SCP-CN-1997, to allow both parties to obtain sufficient time and space to find a [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/sayonara-heaven|permanent solution]]] to the phase collision problem with minimal cost.

The Two Phases Agreement has gone through two large-scale amendments, and has led to various other related agreements. The new additions in each amendment will be highlighted in color.

The Foundation is to provide technology and resources to the Zhujihui for a period of thirty years, so as to assist the Zhujihui to return to its prior standard of military power and containment. The assistance will consist of:
&gt; * A total of 70 billion USD in resources, intended for the Zhujihui to rebuild their facilities, replenish their munitions and hire new personnel.
&gt; 
&gt; * Seminars will be arranged by the Foundation&#39;s most experienced and capable personnel; training will be provided to the Zhujihui&#39;s task forces, so as to improve the Zhujihui&#39;s standard of responding to anomalies.
&gt; 
&gt; * As an exchange of technology, the Zhujihui will be provided with the technology for Barrier-class visual cognitohazard and Class X antimemetic media, to allow the Zhujihui to conceal its presence. ##Red|-- Complete.##
&gt;

As of the drafting of this agreement, Hong Shing is a [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nexus-series|Camelot-class]]] Nexus with a population over 2000; primarily composed of people from the Right Phase, with a minority form the Left Phase.

To ensure the stability of reality within Hong Shing, Hume level fluctuations caused by a large population carrying out anomalous activity is necessary. However, as the Foundation and Zhujihui have insufficient personnel and means to manage an anomalous community with such a potential for growth, it is necessary to bring in external official forces to establish an autonomous city government within Hong Shing and ensure Hong Shing has stable population growth and a development plan.

Following discussion, it has been decided to bring into Hong Shing the forces of the &#34;United State of A Mary King&#34;, a country in the Right Phase, in an official capacity. At the same time, the Foundation will encourage anomalous communities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau area to move into Hong Shing. The specific proposal is as follows:
&gt; * The Foundation&#39;s Mobile Task Force Tau-15 (&#34;Crown Jewels&#34;) and the Zhujihui&#39;s Task Force Omega-16 (&#34;Attacking Scavengers&#34;) will, under the guise of members of the Right Phase organization &#34;Prometheus Group&#34;, remain active in the Right Phase&#39;s Yueguang State area, to allow the A Mary King government&#39;s anomalous bureau to discover the existence of Hong Shing. ##Red|-- Complete.##
&gt; 
&gt; * A group of governors, the &#34;Hong Shing Council&#34;, composed of representatives from Hong Shing&#39;s residents, will be given the right to manage Hong Shing&#39;s community; members of the Foundation and the Zhujihui will use their positions as residents of Hong Shing to lead this Council. The Hong Shing Council will promote thaumaturgical implements to block the divine energy produced by residents from the Right Phase, and will be the representative body of Hong Shing in dealings with the government of the United State of A Mary King. ##Red| -- Complete. Laws have been passed to ensure residents from Right Phase wear divine-energy-blocking implements.##
&gt; 
&gt; * The Zhujihui is to spy on the government of the United State of A Mary King, to ensure the relations between A Mary King and Hong Shing remain beneficial. The Foundation&#39;s Memetics Department will provide weaponized memetic agents and cognitohazards to aid the Zhujihui to this end. ##Red| -- Complete. Representatives from the A Mary King government anomalous organization, the &#34;Unusual Incidents Unit&#34;, have entered the Hong Shing Council; A Mary King has recognized Hong Shing as an autonomous city under its protection.##
&gt; 
&gt; * The main and Chinese Branches of the Foundation will draw support from official powers to increase the suppression of anomalous society in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau area; at the same time, they are to spread information of Hong Shing in various anomalous communities so as to draw surrounding anomalous residents into Hong Shing. ##Red|-- Partially complete; progress has been excellent in Guangdong, with much of anomalous society drawn into Hong Shing; the colonial governments have been unable to suppress anomalous communities in Hong Kong and Macau. Various anomalous communities have come to know of Hong Shing&#39;s existence; Marshall, Carter &amp; Dark and various other anomalous commerce organizations have already begun to establish themselves in Hong Shing.##
&gt; 
&gt; * The Hong Shing Council is to establish border posts in all entrances to Hong Shing, so as to record the populations entering and leaving Hong Shing; only a few entrances are to remain open to allow &#34;illegal&#34; immigration and Foundation and Zhujihui staff. This work is planned to be taken over by the A Mary King government.##Red| -- Complete. Management of entrances to the Right Phase has been handed over to the A Mary King customs bureau &#34;Hong Gong Anomalous Management and Development Office (Customs Department)&#34;. ##
&gt; 
&gt; * The Foundation is to search for people from the Right Phase not wearing divine-energy-blocking implements in the Left Phase in areas near the entrances to Hong Shing and return them to the Right Phase in accordance with A Mary King law. ##Red|-- In progress. Currently, 180 violators have been returned so far.##
The above proposal --is to begin-- began --in early June-- ##Red|on 12 June## 1974, and --is planned to be complete in October-- ##Red|has been completed as of October 25.##

In order to prevent deterioration of relations between the Foundation and Zhujihui, and between the Two Phases, and to raise the effectiveness of containment, the Foundation and Zhujihui have come to a consensus on the following arrangements for anomalous residents and objects:
&gt; * Live testing is to be prohibited on humans from the opposite Phase. Autopsy remains unrestricted.
&gt; 
&gt; * If a transfer is authorized, objects will be contained in the phase they belong to, and anomalous individuals from the other Phase must be given to the other Phase&#39;s organization for containment. If no transfer is authorized, Special Containment Procedures shall be defined by specialists from the Phase in which the anomaly originates.
&gt; 
&gt; * Non-humanoid anomalies from the opposite Phase do not need to be transferred to the original Phase&#39;s organization for containment; however, it is recommended that personnel from the original Phase&#39;s organization are involved in drafting containment procedures.
&gt; 
&gt; * Anomalies discovered in Hong Shing that pose significant danger will be contained by the organization that discovers them first; the other organization is to aid in containment if requested or the situation becomes dire.

[[==]]
The first amendment was motivated by the &#34;Sky Wall Painter Riot&#34; that occurred on September 28 the same year. During the incident, the credibility of Hong Shing&#39;s autonomous government was severely damaged, and police from the A Mary King Unusual Incidents Unit suffered heavy losses. This resulted in the widespread knowledge of A Mary King&#39;s &#34;anti-magicalist&#34; government posing a significant threat to the stability of Hong Shing&#39;s development.

In addition, the Foundation&#39;s aid to the Zhujihui is to cease in nine years; the Zhujihui&#39;s power has returned to a level that allows them to carry out their mission; there is a need to renegotiate the terms.

The objective of this amendment is to deal with the fallout of the &#34;Sky Wall Painter Riot&#34;, and amend the agreement in accordance with the development of the two parties and Hong Shing itself.。

The Foundation is to provide technology and resources to the Zhujihui for a period of thirty years, so as to assist the Zhujihui to return to its prior standard of military power and containment. The assistance will consist of:
&gt; * A total of 70 billion USD in resources, intended for the Zhujihui to rebuild their facilities, replenish their munitions and hire new personnel. ##Red|--Completed in 1990[[footnote]] 4227 AtG [[/footnote]]. Zhujihui financial personnel have stated that they do not require a second round of assistance.##
&gt; 
&gt; * --Seminars will be arranged by the Foundation&#39;s most experienced and capable personnel; training will be provided to the Zhujihui&#39;s task forces, so as to improve the Zhujihui&#39;s standard of responding to anomalies.-- ##Red|-- The Zhujihui&#39;s specialized techniques have gained the recognition of both the main and Chinese branches of the Foundation; currently, the &#34;Foundation-Zhujihui Scholars&#39; Exchange Meeting&#34; is held every May 1 in Hong Shing for the purpose of exchanging technology and expertise.##
&gt; 
&gt; * The Foundation will establish Mobile Task Force Kappa-10 (&#34;Boundary Priests&#34;), composed of personnel experienced with spatial anomalies to enter Hong Shing to assist the Zhujihui&#39;s thaumaturges in maintaining the border wall of Hong Shing. ##Red|-- Invitations have been extended to various Groups of Interest who have been responsible for the protection of the spatial barrier during the &#34;Sky Wall Painter Riot&#34; to encourage them to participate in maintenance of the Sky Wall. The establishment of a loose coalition, the &#34;Sky Wall Watch&#34;, is in the planning stage.##

##Red|The Foundation will create permanent information channels to share information on incidents and anomalous activity occurring in Hong Shing and exchange technology when required.##

At the same time, the Zhujihui is to arrange for a team of specialists to enter the Left Phase as guest personnel to assist the Chinese Branch of the Foundation in managing the anomalies that surfaced in the China area due to the interference of the Right Phase; this team is to change every five years. ##Red|-- Specialist teams have stayed with the Foundation upon completing of their term. As an exchange, the Foundation is to dispatch specialist teams to the Right Phase to assist the Zhujihui in managing anomalies originating from the Left Phase.##

**Section II. Management and Population Arrangements for the Hong Shing Area**
[[div style=&#34;border: solid 2px #000000; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);&#34;]]

As of the drafting of this amendment, Hong Shing&#39;s population has exceeded 120,000; of this number, 40% are from the Left Phase, 55% are from the Right Phase, and 5% are Hong Shing-born individuals. As Hong Shing has become a channel of exchange between the Two Phases, the current arrangements surrounding the entrances to Hong Shing have begun to show insufficiency in managing the throughput of individuals, and must be amended while maintaining the Veil.

In addition, analysis has shown that the main reason for loss of control during the &#34;Sky Wall Painter Riot&#34; was the independent action of the government of the United State of A Mary King; the Hong Shing Council did not serve its purpose as a mediator, and the underrepresentation of residents from the Left Phase led to a loss of their status. In order to prevent similar incidents from occurring in future, it is planned to reduce the influence of the United State of A Mary King in Hong Shing, involve the Left Phase nation &#34;the People&#39;s Republic of China&#34;, and reestablish equality between residents from the Two Phases. The specific proposal is as follows:

&gt; * The Foundation is to spy on the government of the People&#39;s Republic of China, to ensure the Chinese government becomes aware of the existence of a neutral region located within Hong Kong in which Chinese expatriates live. ##Red| -- Complete. The Chinese government anomalous organization, the &#34;Relevant Group&#34;, has agreed to cooperate with the Foundation in protecting the interests of Chinese expatriates in the region, and had an important effect by establishing the Hong Kong Police Force Hong Shing Department.##
&gt; 
&gt; * The Foundation is to spy on the government of the People&#39;s Republic of China, so as to encourage the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government to send representatives to the Hong Shing Council and repartition Hong Shing&#39;s law enforcement system. ##Red|-- Complete. Representatives from the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have entered the Hong Shing Council. The &#34;Hong Shing Police Agreement&#34; has been signed; the Hong Kong Police Force Hong Shing Department will manage law enforcement in the West District; the reorganized A Mary King Unusual Incidents Unit Hong Shing Division will manage law enforcement in the East District; and responsibility for the Central District will be shared between them.##
&gt; 
&gt; * To encourage fruitful cooperation between the various Groups of Interest active in Hong Shing from both Phases, the barriers between them are to be removed. ##Red|--Partially complete. The Left Phase anomalous educational institute &#34;St. Christina College&#34; and the Right Phase anomalous educational institute &#34;Hong Shing Hang Tan College&#34; have established friendly cooperation; however, tensions between the Left Phase group &#34;Marshall, Carter &amp; Dark&#34; and the Right Phase &#34;X Chamber of Commerce&#34; are still high.##
&gt; 
&gt; * Improvements are to be made for transportation between Hong Kong SAR (Left Phase), Hong Shing and Hong Gong Islands (Right Phase), consolidating the scattered transportation infrastructure in a manner that does not break the &#34;Veil Protocol&#34;. ##Red|-- Complete. The &#34;Two Phases Urban Transportation Agreement&#34; and &#34;Two Phases Urban Information Agreement&#34;, among others, have been signed; the &#34;Community of Alternate Phase Cities of Hong Gong&#34;, consisting of Hong Kong, Hong Shing and Hong Gong Islands, has been established. In the &#34;Two Phases Urban Transportation Agreement&#34;, a large number of cross-phase transportation infrastructure has been established. The first metro line spanning all three areas, the &#34;Rumsey Line&#34;, has already been completed, and further cross-phase lines are in planning.##
&gt; 
&gt; * The Hong Shing Council and Hong Gong Anomalous Management and Development Office (Customs Department) are to establish border posts in all entrances to Hong Shing, so as to record the populations entering and leaving Hong Shing; only a few entrances are to remain open to allow --&#34;illegal&#34; immigration and-- Foundation and Zhujihui staff. ##Red|--Management of entrances to the Left Phase have been handed over to the Customs Bureau (Hong Shing Area); the Hong Shing Council no longer manages border control.##
&gt; 
&gt; * The Foundation is to search for people from the Right Phase not wearing divine-energy-blocking implements in the Left Phase in areas near the entrances to Hong Shing and return them to the Right Phase in accordance with A Mary King law. 
The above proposal --is to begin-- began on 7 January 1998 [[footnote]] 4235 AtG[[/footnote]], and --is planned to be complete in November-- ##Red|has been completed as of November 18.##

The second amendment was signed in the wake of the &#34;Sky Hole Crisis&#34; on May 16. During the incident, a large hole opened in the spatial boundary of Hong Shing, leading to the near collapse of the structure of reality within Hong Shing. Although the hole was filled with the help of various organizations active in Hong Shing, the incident reflected the rapid development of Hong Shing, and the Foundation and Zhujihui began to find difficulty in maintaining the Sky Wall alone.

The objective of this amendment is to regulate Hong Shing&#39;s rate of development, expand and reinforce Hong Shing&#39;s space, and establish an organization to coordinate the paranormal forces within Hong Shing to maintain the spatial boundary of Hong Shing.

In order to maintain the completeness of the spatial boundary, the specialists from the following organizations have left their original posts to join a new organization:
&gt; * (Left) SCP Foundation
&gt; * (Left) St. Christina College
&gt; * (Left) Marshall, Carter and Dark
&gt; * (Left) Hong Kong Police Force Hong Shing Department
&gt; * (Left) Ministry of State Security of the People&#39;s Republic of China, Anomalous Matters Bureau[[footnote]] Also known as the &#34;19th Bureau&#34; or the &#34;Relevant Group&#34; [[/footnote]]
&gt; * (Left) Are We Cool Yet?
&gt; * (Left) Global Occult Coalition
&gt; * (Left) Letters Entertainment
&gt; * (Right) Zhujihui
&gt; * (Right) Hong Shing Hang Tan College
&gt; * (Right) University of the Hong Gong Islands
&gt; * (Right) X Chamber of Commerce
&gt; * (Right) A Mary King Federal Bureau of Investigation Unusual Incidents Unit
&gt; * (Right) Church of Bright, Hong Shing Parish
&gt; * (Hong Shing) Sky Wall Painters&#39; Association
&gt; * (Hong Shing) Hong Gong Urban University

This new organization has the sole goal of maintaining the completeness and stability of the spatial boundary of Hong Shing, protecting Hong Shing and the Two Phases from the risk of phase collision.

Following discussion, this organization will be known as the &#34;Sky Wall Maintenance Committee&#34;, and the above members shall be known as the &#34;Founding Members&#34;.

As one of the Founding Members, the Foundation and Zhujihui, which have not previously operated in the public within Hong Shing, are to begin public operation in Hong Shing following the commencement of this Amendment; in order to protect Hong Shing from any grave danger posed by anomalous objects, such objects are to be contained outside Hong Shing.

&gt; //Ah, it&#39;s almost been forty years since the Zhujihui escaped to Hong Shing. The Zhujihui, in this time, has come from a poor imitation to become equals with the Foundation from the other world. Our predecessors from the Era of the Gods are surely smiling upon us, their successors. How wonderful.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Where we are, thousands of years ago, must have been similar to where you are now, right? There&#39;s countries with patriotic countrymen, businessmen with their wares, researchers investigating new technology, and even organizations that protect the anomalous. Even if the Era of the Gods has gone into the twilight, their ideals have finally been passed down. Or maybe in the years that passed, their ideals have changed, and all that is needed is an opportunity...//
&gt; 
&gt; //And nonetheless their nature has always been passed down to their successors, allowing even we hoodlums to rise to the protectors of the world.//
&gt; 
&gt; //I wonder what the scholars of the Zhujihui were thinking when they were stepping over their colleagues&#39; dead bodies to escape into Hong Shing. Were they regretting the damage they&#39;d done in the past? Proud that they had saved the world? Or excited that they were following in the steps of their predecessors? A few years ago I could have thought it was the former two, but when the Zhujihui truly took flight, I discovered that in truth, the very moment the flesh and blood of the whole of the Zhujihui&#39;s higher echelons was transformed into the structure of Hong Shing, the Zhujihui had already become like the Foundation of old.//
&gt; 
&gt; //When I was young, I had an argument with my father that made me the person I am today. Back then, I hated him with all my heart. But now, I&#39;m proud of him.//
