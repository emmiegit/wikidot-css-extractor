++ **Addendum 5257-3: Incident 5257-A**

On the 8th of May, 2029, a sudden alteration in SCP-5257-1&#39;s normal activities occurred, seemingly out of nowhere. 

Numerous different changes were observed as a result of this alteration, including:
* a significant increase in the general speed of SCP-5257-A and SCP-5257-B
* a rise in the average number of glitches seen during SCP-5257-A
* an increase in SCP-5257-1&#39;s efforts to communicate with Foundation staff, especially regarding Spec. Eliza Kellock, and
* mentions of an unknown piece of music in SCP-5257-1&#39;s messages, described as a &#34;beautiful symphony&#34;.

These changes culminated in Incident 5257-A, which took place on the 11th of May, 2029. A decommissioned article was uploaded to the 5257 slot at 13:30, belonging to a now neutralised info-hazard that spread through listening to an anomalous copy of Vivaldi&#39;s Four Seasons. The article contained an audio file belonging to a non-anomalous version of Concerto No. 1 in E Major, &#34;Spring&#34;.

After about 20 minutes, SCP-5257-A had fully elapsed, and Lyne.aic went down not long after, prompting RAISA technicians who were on duty that day to check on the 5257 slot. After Lyne.aic was put back online, said technicians created a copy of the now corrupted file, reading through the distorted text and downloading the non-anomalous recording of the song, attached below.

The file&#39;s name had been corrupted, but the title seemed to have been directly altered rather than created through SCP-5257-A, displaying a single word: &#34;Liberty&#34;.

A particular anomaly was noticed within the last 7 to 8 seconds of the song, when the symphony became completely indiscernible from a high-pitched buzzing sound and static playing in the background of the recording. When this audio-based anomaly was put through a spectrogram, the following image was created.

After this incident, SCP-5257-1 suddenly returned to its normal behaviour with SCP-5257-A and -B reverting back to their normal speeds. However, certain changes still persisted, including the rise in the quantity of messages SCP-5257-1 left in data they were fed, and continued mentions of the symphony and message above. 

Following this, technicians working on the DIDS were restricted from opening any files corrupted by SCP-5257-1, and were advised not to engage with SCP-5257-1.
