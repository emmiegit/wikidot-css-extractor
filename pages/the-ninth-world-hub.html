- From the Way of the Undeath on the Set Of Nine
[[/=]]
[[/div]]

The Ninth World refers to the current era that the anomalous world has entered. The power of the anomalous has waxed and waned throughout history and at this time we’ve entered a period of waxing.

Parascientific advances that were once thought impossible are now possible, and Thaumaturges find their spells more potent than ever before. The Foundation is beset on all sides by new GOIs rising up in the chaos of it all. The shift into the Ninth World has brought a change in the world&#39;s anomalous fauna, as the rate of new species being cataloged has increased exponentially.

Pataphysically, the narrative of the Ninth World has become easier and easier to modify. The correct course of events is under constant threat of being changed by outside influences such as SCP-4230 and SCP-7114.

Alongside these changes, the underworld of the anomalous community has grown out from the watchful eye of the Foundation. This is all thanks in part to The Net, a digital dimension that is a full 3D representation of the world&#39;s data. The Net is hosted on various anomalous servers that are accessed by uploading the Mind into one of them directly or by use of a portable device called a cyberdeck. These servers host a variety of spaces for luxury, commerce, entertainment, and combat. The Net isn&#39;t all just fun and games however, plenty of illegal anomalous activity occurs here. With more and more functions of anomalous organizations being controlled through the Net, a digital war is being waged between hackers that run jobs for the various GoIs.

But what caused this sudden shift into the Ninth World? Well, it can be traced to the creation of the Set of Nine. A set of potentially ten anomalous books that were scattered throughout time and space. 

[[f&lt;image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/secure-facility-dossier-site-78/site-78.svg width=&#34;200px&#34;]]

These powerful tomes began a power struggle between the various anomalous factions. While just having one book of the Set could grant you extraordinary power, having all nine is said to bring &#34;paradise&#34; to the world.

You never know what to expect from the Ninth World, so pick up a Gauss Rifle and stand with us against the dark.

By the way, Finland doesn&#39;t exist in this universe... it&#39;s a whole thing.

----

If you are intrigued, you must be wondering what stories drive the Ninth World. Primarily the Ninth World centers on the efforts of Site-78&#39;s efforts to contain the Set of Nine which kickstarts an worldwide book hunt involving countless GoIs, evil thaumaturges, mercenaries, and threats beyond the stars.

Secondly, in the Chugwater Chronicles, we find our intrepid researchers in a smaller scale setting. The residents of Chugwater act as if the anomaly is just a fact of normalcy. But why is that? And how does that affect containment efforts of the various oddities that pop up in Chugwater? This series seeks to find out.

[[tab What is the Ninth World?]]

So what is the big deal about the Ninth World? To put it simply the Ninth World is a series in which the anomalous activity is at its apex. The Ninth World features a large shifting community of various factions and groups vying for control.  Mercenaries, gangs, cults, aliens, shadowy organizations, thaumaturges, and more.

This waxing period was kicked off by the creation of the Set of Nine. While each book is limited to a certain facet of knowledge, using them together would shift the power balance in one owner&#39;s favor. Some even say that if all of the books are brought together it would lead to paradise...

Needless to say in this precarious situation, the Foundation needed to adapt fast.  Foundation technology and its grasp of the paranormal sciences quickly snowballed thanks to SCP-6952 and its ability to create new anomalous resources. The Foundation&#39;s enemies were numerous and growing by the day and they would need every advantage they had.

Site-78 stood at the forefront of this with the stated goal of defending humanity against the danger posed by the Set of Nine and other Groups of Interest. But not all could be as forward-thinking as Site-78, the Foundation is not a virtuous organization, and the men and women of Site-78 face pushback against some of their more lenient ideas of using anomalies to combat threats to the Foundation.

At its core, the Ninth World is about treating the anomalous as a facet of existence rather than an eclectic group of oddities. It can be a strange and whacky place, for every world-eating monster there&#39;s an anomalous fanon wiki. It&#39;s a world where the Foundation can&#39;t be everywhere and groups like the Valravn Corporation flourish in providing aid where the Foundation cannot. For better or for worse.

It&#39;s about trying to be a hero in the face of a world that doesn&#39;t want you to be, that forces you to make the hard choices. The trials and tribulations that ring on the psyche of its characters.

We must go forward for the betterment of humanity, to die in the dark so they may live in the light.
[[/tab]]
[[tab GoIs]]

++++++ Original Groups of Interest

**Volk Division:** The Volk Division is a group of Russian mercenaries that field anomalous weaponry and vehicles as well as using wolf-themed anomalous beasts. They are led by Grigori Alexandrovich, a ruthless former Spetnaz. They are primarily supported by the Russian PoI, Lefty who supplies them with paratechnology. The Volk Division regularly clashes with the SCP Foundation and the Valravn Corp, as they seek the Set of Nine for themselves.

How to write: The Volk Division is primarily used as your generic mooks to be killed en masse either via Valkyrie or MTF. While they definitely pose a threat, especially in large numbers their mostly meant to be cannon fodder and should be used as such. If you are writing about a Volk Division anomaly it should be primarily be focused either around wolves or battlefield weaponry. Stories that involve the Volks often have them interfering with Foundation containment operations in third-world countries or dark underbelly of the anomalous world. Valravn is almost consistently hired to check their advances, so they are an easy villain for a more Anti-heroic Valravn piece.

**The Sepulchrum:** The Sepulchrum is one part Death Cult, one part Megachurch. They hold a philosophy the state of undeath is the highest form a being can attain and will do anything to reach it. The Sepulchrum&#39;s reach is vast with sects in countries across the world. Unlike your standard death cult, they gain their members through tactics seen in Evangelical megachurches, propaganda, advertisements, merchandise and whatever else they can use to spread their message.

How to Write: Sepulchrum anomalies focus around undeath: ghouls, liches, ghosts, spirits, demons, zombies, and anything that was once alive now brought back. Their forces regularly employ Thaumaturges and non-living beings. Feel free to make any combat encounter with them varied. Zombies? Skeleton mages? The sky is the limit to what horrors the Sepulchrum has under it&#39;s control. Stories involving the Sepulchrum should revolve around their quest to attain undeath or add a new anomaly under their control.

|||| Formerly of the Pataphysics Department, Researcher Chudley is an enigma. On the surface, he&#39;s a bumbling, neurotic jokester who gets on just about everyone&#39;s nerves. On the inside, he&#39;s a competent scientist that outwits most opponents. Overall, he&#39;s completely out of his depth but he&#39;s the best chance they&#39;ve got.||
||~ Lena Lorri ||~ Botanical Sciences||

She is a ruthless, cold, and efficient woman with a strong belief in the Nordic Gods. She has no love for the women under her command, seeing them as tools to be used to further company profit.||
||~ Olga Brandt ||~ Tyr Project Lead, Valkyrie Project||
|||| Dr. Brandt is the creator of the Valkyrie program and oversees the augmentation of new Valkyrie Candidates. Most Valkyries refer to her as a mother but the love she has for her creations is dependent on their usefulness.||

||~ Sigrun||~ Sveromeyja , S-03||
|||| Sofia Lisko was once a Ukrainian Soldier whose family was murdered by the Volk Division. Fueled by vengeance she was recruited by Valravn who wanted to turn her rage into a powerful weapon. Now known as the Wolf slayer/Wolfsbane, she takes on contracts against the Volks to find the man who killed her family. Sigrun is known for her violent tendencies against Volk mercenaries and anyone who dare touch the innocent, often leaving her enemies mutilated and torn apart.||
||~ Gondul||~ Sveromeyja , S-04||
|||| Mari Sukumiya was once a hacker known as Kitsukumi7015, a robin hood esque figure that utilized The Net to steal from the wealthy and give to the poor. Once she stole from the Yakuza, her eyes were burned out and her skull was damaged. Valravn took advantage of this and augmented her to serve as the Sveromeyja&#39;s technical officer. She may appear meek and introverted but once the raven helmet comes on, she is a dangerous combatant, even more so in the digital realm, she often inhabits.||

[[tab How to Contribute]]

Before writing for the Ninth World you should at least read the following to get an idea of the universe at large:

* The Set of Nine Series by [[*user SYTYCFanon]]

The Ninth World is meant to be a general setting, so not every story has to be at Site-78. Want to write an article set in the far future? On an alien planet? Or far in the past? As long as there is some tangible link to connect to the rest of the &#39;verse, you are good to go.

As for the tone of the Ninth World, it can vary wildly. Ninth World stories can be comedies, action pieces, horror, and just anything under the sun.

However, despite this, the Ninth World has a couple of overarching themes that you should try to abide by.

* Dark Comedy. Not everything in the verse has to be doom and gloom, sneak a few jokes in there if you want to keep things a bit light but nothing completely tone shattering
* As for the Foundation itself, not everyone holds the world views of Site-78. On the whole, the Foundation is still a morally dubious organization. Characters within Site-78 frequently are at odds with some of the more &#34;hardline&#34; elements of the SCP Foundation.  
* Sci-Fi and magic meet as one in this universe. If you don&#39;t know what this is referring to, look at tabletop games like Shadowrun and Warhammer 40k.  The verse tends to lie heavily on the Foundation of having advanced Technology and even one-day spaceflight. However, that doesn&#39;t mean that evil sorcerers and folklore creatures are out of the question.
* Maintaining your humanity in the face of the anomalous. The Ninth World can be a dark place despite some of the more lighthearted elements. Ninth World characters are often broken in some way and have trauma or problems they are trying to work through. Being a hero in this world means making hard choices.


Other than themes of the universe there are also some general rules you should abide by to avoid creating issues.

* Pay attention to dates in Ninth World articles. While some character inconsistencies may arise due to multiple writers working on this, continuity should be maintained above all else.
* Do message [[*user SYTYCFanon]] if you want to write any additions to the main Set of Nine series or have suggestions. As it&#39;s an integral part of the universe, he would like it to ensure that it&#39;s at quality standards.
* Feel free to create your Sites within the Ninth World. Not everything needs to revolve around Site-78.

[[tab What is Canon?]]


What is hard canon:

* [[*User NDHeckfire]]&#39;s [[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6296 EVERSOR Initiative]] directly crosses over with the Ninth World in SCP-7560. The initiative starts in November of 2022 so keep that in mind.
* S. Andrew Swann&#39;s SCP-001 proposal
* The Ninth World follows the threshold Route of SCP-6500 as Vanguard never forms.

What is most likely Canon:

* OG43 features heavily in the background lore of some of the Ninth World&#39;s supporting characters and thus is considered adjacent to the Ninth World. 
* [[*user Kilerpoyo]] Ravens and Vipers series is mentioned heavily in the Ninth World but isn&#39;t completely compliant due to conflicting timelines.
* The Ninth World is not above using INT lore as long as it&#39;s compliant it can be used.


What isn&#39;t Canon:

* Canons like Nightfall, Daybreak, Broken Masquerade, Ad Aspera ad Astra and others that change the general status quo are non-canon. This doesn&#39;t mean alternate versions of Ninth World characters can&#39;t exist in these canons but they don&#39;t affect the main universe.
* Articles that directly contradict the timeline established in the Ninth World.
* This policy extends to articles like SCP-7015 which take place in radically altered universes.
