[[/=]]
[[/div]]

The Universe as we know it can be separated into nine eras, worlds if you will. Even-numbered worlds are periods of &#34;waning&#34; in the anomalous community, Magic fades and anomalous beings are few and far between. Odd-numbered worlds are periods of Waxing. Magic is stronger, technological advancement is easier, and miracles like you&#39;d never thought possible become reality.

I knew that the damage caused by the Occult Wars of the 1800-1900s that shifted the world into its eighth incarnation had to be undone. So, I compiled the knowledge of the gods into several tomes and scattered them through time and space to influence reality into shifting into the Ninth World.

Now as I chronicle this new history, I watch as new nexuses spring to light. Technology surges forward and creates &#34;The Net&#34;, a digital world that is physical manifestation of the world&#39;s Data. Denizens under the Veil enjoy its wonders, from entertainment to food to the many robust locales. However, at its core, The Net&#39;s heart festers with corruption. It is a haven for Criminals, terrorists, and other enemies of the accursed jailors to run their shady dealings. The underbelly of The Net is a lawless, rotting corpse, gorged on by Valravn whose services are more than desirable when there is no order.

I document new anomalous species being born and new magicks springing forth into the world. These changes bring new factions into the fold. The Sepulchrum for example, seeks my Ninth Book to fulfill their dream of turning the world undead. An unfortunate fate for most, but who am I to stifle their dream of paradise?

My work wasn&#39;t perfect, however. The story of the Ninth World appears to be easily changed by outside forces. Those small pranksters at GAW, for example, made Finland into a real country in order to set an example to the world. Funny, those little Gamers are.

Much to my surprise, the stories of the Ninth World all connect to one town in the American Midwest, Chugwater. This tiny anomalous burg is home to a variety of anomalous fauna, phenomena, and entities all living under the watchful eye of Site-78.

[[image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/RIT_building_-_Gordon_Field_House.jpg]]

The jailers of Site-78 are cut from a different cloth. While they are content to allow the anomalous to roam freely as long as they maintain their &#34;Veil&#34;, the hypocrites oppose my dream of paradise. They bumble around with my books, using their power to contain the new anomalies born from my work. But not even the Foundation, as &#34;Moral&#34; as they claim to be, is free from the desire for a better world.

Where do you stand I wonder? Everyone has a place in the grand game of the Ninth World. Now that the Foundation and the GOC no longer hold a monopoly on the world&#39;s stage, will you be a Player or a Pawn? I for one, am looking forward to seeing how things play out, and the stories you might tell.

[[tab What is Ninth World?]]


The Ninth World is a new status quo for the SCP Universe. The introduction of the Set of Nine has influenced the anomalous world in ways not seen before. This canon has a heavy focus on exploring personal traumas and how characters cope with a world that is changing faster than they can adapt.

One of the biggest features of the Ninth World was the creation of FP-99, also known as &#34;The Net&#34;, the pinnacle of VR technology.

A large virtual world accessed by beaming one&#39;s consciousness inside of it. Formed from thousands of personal hubs and larger servers, The Net allows you to visit places from your wildest dreams, perform IT work, and sample every vice and piece of the entertainment the anomalous world has to offer.

Despite The Net seeming like a virtual paradise, it has allowed for the proliferation of the criminal underworld under the veil to the point where it has become unmanageable by the GOC and the Foundation, so users seek other solutions.. like Valravn.

[[image http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/ninthworldredux/escp-art-synthwave-city-night-sky-pv.jpg]]

But despite all of the sword and sorcery going on on the macro scale, there is still plenty of stories to be told on the minor scale at Site-78. Chugwater is meant to be the Midwest personified and the anomalies reflect that. This small town is weird, quirky, and hiding a treasure trove of strange anomalous phenomena. People in Chugwater see the anomalous as a facet of everyday life, so containment is often a bit more nuanced.

But at the heart of its heart the Ninth World is about the characters. Some are lost souls looking for a way in this new world, while others are out to sow chaos and take advantage of the new situation they find themselves in.

If that interests you, let’s take a look at the players in the game we call the Ninth World.

[[/tab]]
[[tab The Players]]

**The SCP Foundation:** Secure. Contain. Protect. These are the core tenets of the Foundation at large but how far will they go to uphold them in this new anomalous era? The Foundation itself has only benefitted from the volumes of the Set under its control and has no qualms about utilizing the technology and Thaumaturgy that has sprung up in the Ninth World.

Whispers amongst the ranks wonder what the O5 Council will do once the Foundation controls the Set of Nine. Everyone has their own definition of paradise and a potential future involving the end of the anomalous might be on the cards.

**Volk Division:** The Volk Division is a group of Russian mercenaries that field anomalous weaponry and vehicles as well as using wolf-themed anomalous beasts. They are led by Grigori Alexandrovich, a ruthless former Spetnaz. They are primarily supported by the Russian PoI, Lefty who supplies them with paratechnology. The Volk Division regularly clashes with the SCP Foundation and the Valravn Corp, as they seek the Set of Nine for themselves.

**The Sepulchrum:** The Sepulchrum is one part Death Cult, one part Megachurch. They hold a philosophy the state of undeath is the highest form a being can attain and will do anything to reach it. The Sepulchrum&#39;s reach is vast with sects in countries across the world. Unlike your standard death cult, they gain their members through tactics seen in Evangelical megachurches, propaganda, advertisements, merchandise and whatever else they can use to spread their message.

**Valravn:** The Valravn Corporation is a neo-pagan mercenary group that field augmented soldiers and whatever mythological anomalies they can get their hands on. They are on uneasy terms with the SCP Foundation in the Ninth World, skirting the line of the Cartagena agreement to gain more power for themselves and offset the power imbalance between them and SCPF.

**The Naja:** A splinter faction of the Serpent&#39;s Hand lead by Corra, the author of the Set of Nine. Their stated goal is the collection of all knowledge, exemplified by the creation of the Set of Nine which will lead the world to a paradise where the anomalous runs free and all suffering will end.

**Raptor Tec. Industries:** Got a need for protection? Raptor Tec. has you covered. An anomalous arms manufacturer based out of Germany, Raptor Tec. sells to whoever is buying and this primarily includes the Foundation&#39;s enemies. Members of the Naja and the Sepulchrum wouldn&#39;t be caught dead without armaments from Raptor.

||~ Freya ||~ Vakyrie Drottning||
|||| Freya is the military commander of the Valkyries, overseeing and giving contracts to the individual squads that reside at Valkyrie HQ. She is a ruthless, cold, and efficient woman with a strong belief in the Nordic Gods. She has no love for the women under her command, seeing them as tools to be used to further company profit.||
||~ Olga Brandt ||~ Tyr Project Lead, Valkyrie Project||
|||| Dr. Brandt is the creator of the Valkyrie program and oversees the augmentation of new Valkyrie Candidates. Most Valkyries refer to her as a mother but the love she has for her creations is dependent on their usefulness.||
||~ Brynhilde ||~ Sveromeyja Squad Leader, S-01||
|||| Brynhilde, formerly Vanessa Poltaya is known as the Sisterless Raven, as she is the sole survivor of two destroyed Valkyrie squads. She is stern but fair, personable to her sisters, and ruthless to her enemies.||
||~ Herja||~ Sveromeyja , S-02||
|||| Once known as Anna Koski, Herja is a master swordswoman. She prefers to rely on her swordsmanship rather than augmentations. Prior to joining the Valkyries, she experienced a miscarriage that haunts her to this day. She has a motherly affection for Sigrun as she sees her as the daughter she lost that fateful day.||
||~ Sigrun||~ Sveromeyja , S-03||
|||| Sofia Lisko was once a Ukrainian Soldier whose family was murdered by the Volk Division. Fueled by vengeance she was recruited by Valravn who wanted to turn her rage into a powerful weapon. Now known as the Wolf slayer/Wolfsbane, she takes on contracts against the Volks to find the man who killed her family. Sigrun is known for her violent tendencies against Volk mercenaries and anyone who dare touch the innocent, often leaving her enemies mutilated and torn apart.||
||~ Gondul||~ Sveromeyja , S-04||
|||| Mari Sukumiya was once a hacker known as Kitsukumi7015, a robin hood esque figure that utilized The Net to steal from the wealthy and give to the poor. Once she stole from the Yakuza, her eyes were burned out and her skull was damaged. Valravn took advantage of this and augmented her to serve as the Sveromeyja&#39;s technical officer. She may appear meek and introverted but once the raven helmet comes on, she is a dangerous combatant, even more so in the digital realm, she often inhabits.||

[[tab How to Contribute]]


The Ninth World is a big place, filled with multiple factions and locations of interest. But Ninth World stories are personal affairs that study and test their characters in a myriad of ways.

**Tone:** Tone is dependent on what you should be writing for. Entries in the Set of Nine are primarily serious and can deal with dark themes. There is room for some levity here and there like with 7990 and 5938 but to underplay a serious moment. Chugwater pieces tend lean towards absurdity and comedy but horror isn&#39;t out of the question

**Things to remember:**

* The common thread within Site-78 is that they are consistently underfunded and underbudgeted even with the Foundation&#39;s support on the containment of the Set. We&#39;re underdogs here, make us feel like it.
* Site-78 is split into various departments which are listed in the Site&#39;s dossier. Don&#39;t feel limited to these however, Site-78 is constantly growing so don&#39;t be afraid to create new Department heads to lead your stories.
* The denizens of Chugwater aren&#39;t phased by anomalous activity and see it as a part of normalcy. Don&#39;t forget this fact when writing about how the anomaly co-exists within the town itself.
* The verse tends to lie heavily on the Foundation of having advanced Technology and even one-day spaceflight. However, that doesn&#39;t mean that evil sorcerers and folklore creatures are out of the question.
* Pieces within the Chugwater Chronicles should exemplify midwestern life and themes. Most of the articles contained within are comedic with heart but that doesn&#39;t mean that otherworldly horrors couldn&#39;t be lurking into this weird midwestern burg.
* Valravn pieces at their core shouldn&#39;t glorify PMCs as should serve as critiques of Ultracapitalistic corporations appropriating religions for their bottom dollar. The men and women who serve Valravn are property to them, they don&#39;t have names only model numbers. Whether or not you want to portray certain members as tragic anti-heroes or simply as dark villains is up to you but at the end of the day the aims of the High Table spell doom for the world.
* A second piece to note about Valravn is that this is NOT a Valravn centric canon. Just because a piece features Valravn does not mean that it is inherently canon to the Ninth World.

**Topic to Cover:**

* The Net. What effects does it have on its users? What horrors could be lurking within? How do GOIs use it to their benefit
* Chugwater/Site-78. How does containment differ in a place where the anomalous is basically normal? What phenomena, creatures, and other anomalies make up this place,
* GoIs. How are the various Groups of Interest dealing with effects of the Ninth World? What new critters are there for WWS to find? What new plots is Valravn hatching in the shadows? What new prank or societal change will GAW attempt to enact?
* The Set of Nine. The release of each book in time has had ripple effects everywhere. What new anomalies are they responsible for? How has getting a hold of one, changed the course of a civilization or a group of interest? A full list of the books can be found on Site-78&#39;s dossier.
* Something wholly new. The Ninth World is anyone&#39;s oyster. If nothing above interests you, create a whole new chapter in this ongoing story.

Lastly, there are also some general rules you should abide by to avoid creating issues.

* Pay attention to dates in Ninth World articles. While some character inconsistencies may arise due to multiple writers working on this, continuity should be maintained above all else.
* Do message [[*user SYTYCFanon]] if you want to write any additions to the main Set of Nine series or have suggestions. As it&#39;s an integral part of the universe, he would like it to ensure that it&#39;s at quality standards.
* Feel free to create your Sites within the Ninth World. Not everything needs to revolve around Site-78.
* Don&#39;t step on anyone toes. If you have a question about characters or storylines, talk to the authors involved.

[[tab Canonicity]]

So how does the rest of the wiki fit into all of this? Articles outside of the Ninth World can fall into three categories

**Hard Canon:** Anything within the hard canon is considered to be 100% as is within the Ninth World including dates and all.

**Canon Adjacent or Soft Canon:** These articles&#39; dates don&#39;t necessarily match up with the Ninth World canon but the events and or anomalies within exist in some capacity.

**Non-Canon:** These articles aren&#39;t compliant with the Ninth&#39;s Worlds timeline and lore. This doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t exist in the greater multiverse but as far as the Ninth World is concerned they don&#39;t.

 
What is hard canon:

* [[*User NDHeckfire]]&#39;s [[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6296 EVERSOR Initiative]]
* [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sandrewswann-s-proposal S. Andrew Swann&#39;s Proposal]
* The Ninth World follows the threshold Route of SCP-6500 as Vanguard never forms.

What is Canon Adjacent:

* On Guard 43 features heavily in the background lore of some of the Ninth World&#39;s supporting characters and thus is considered adjacent to the Ninth World.
* [[*user Kilerpoyo]] [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6038 Ravens and Vipers] series is mentioned heavily in the Ninth World but isn&#39;t completely compliant due to conflicting timelines.
* The Ninth World has crossed over with [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/from-120-s-archives-hub F120A] and the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/into-the-void-hub Into The Void]but as [[*user SYTYCFanon]] has not read through them enough, they are considered to be adjacent.
* As a form of quality control, in order to be on the hub a work must exist for 24 hours and maintain a positive rating. Works that fall under 0 will be removed.


What isn&#39;t Canon:

* Canons like Nightfall, Daybreak, Broken Masquerade, Ad Aspera ad Astra and others that change the general status quo are non-canon. This doesn&#39;t mean alternate versions of Ninth World characters can&#39;t exist in these canons but they don&#39;t affect the main universe.
* Articles that directly contradict the timeline established in the Ninth World.
* This policy extends to articles like SCP-7015 which take place in radically altered universes.

If your specific canon/series/article isn&#39;t listed here and doesn&#39;t contradict anything it is safe to assume that is canon in some shape or form.
