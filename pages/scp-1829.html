**Item #:** SCP-1829
 
**Object Class:** Euclid
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1829 is contained at the vacant &#34;Wild Springs&#34; water park in Addison, Wisconsin, where it was originally discovered. At least two (2) Foundation guards are to be posted at the park&#39;s gates to prevent civilian access to SCP-1829. Once weekly, SCP-1829 is to be supplied with 25 kilograms of raw meat (see Addendum 1829-1). The pool at SCP-1829&#39;s base should be inspected following digestion, and any undigested remains should be removed by net and incinerated. As the &#34;Wild Springs&#34; amusement park has been marked condemned since 1979, no further containment procedures are necessary.
 
**Description:** SCP-1829 is an orange and yellow waterslide, approximately 19 meters tall and constructed of an unknown material. A spiraling wooden staircase has been connected to SCP-1829&#39;s entrance, allowing easy access from ground level. SCP-1829&#39;s structure curves twice before ending at a small concrete pool at its base. A pump system attached to said concrete pool supplies water to SCP-1829 on a constant basis.
 
SCP-1829 appears and functions like a normal waterslide until a subject enters a section of tubing shortly after SCP-1829&#39;s second curve - at this point, microscopic pores on SCP-1829&#39;s surface will secrete a flesh-covered aperture of tissue, trapping the subject in place. SCP-1829 will then drain the selected area of water and begin flooding it with gastric acid [[footnote]] Analysis of gastric acid has shown a striking similarity with human stomach acid, with the exception of an abnormally-high amount of pepsin.[[/footnote]], effectively digesting the subject. After digestion is complete (usually spanning 4 to 5 hours) the fleshy aperture will begin to dissolve, and the digested slurry will continue into a rough intestine, where it is further broken down by a caustic mucus produced by SCP-1829. Any surviving material is pushed through peristalsis from the intestine, where it will continue down SCP-1829&#39;s surface until it is ejected into the pool at SCP-1829&#39;s base - as this water is later pumped back into SCP-1829, it is heavily polluted with gastric acid, bile, mucus, and bone fragments.
 
If a subject enters SCP-1829 while it is digesting another subject (or multiple subjects enter the digestion area at once), SCP-1829 will produce additional webs of flesh to contain them until its initial prey has been digested, upon which subjects will be released and channeled into SCP-1829&#39;s &#34;stomach&#34;.

SCP-1829 was discovered four days after its installation at the &#34;Wild Springs&#34; water park, when a █-year-old child was digested and ejected in front of ██ civilians. The park was promptly seized by Foundation agents, and Class-A amnestics supplied to all civilians involved. Oddly, SCP-1829 functioned as a normal waterslide for the first four days of its installation until the incident.
 
**Addendum 1829-1:** Following a long period without feeding, SCP-1829 attempted to digest its own surface material, leaving several caustic burns in the process. To prevent leaking of SCP-1829&#39;s fluids, its containment procedures have been revised to include weekly feeding.

__**Test 1829-1 - 7/4/████**__
&gt; **Subject:** One (1) live chicken, weighing 1.8 kilograms
&gt; **Results:** Four hours later, small feathers and bones expelled from SCP-1829.

__**Test 1829-2 - 7/5/████**__
&gt;  **Subject:** One (1) piece of firewood, weighing 2.7 kilograms
&gt;  **Results:** Five and a half hours later, small woodchips expelled from SCP-1829.

__**Test 1829-3 - 7/5/████**__
&gt;  **Subject:** One (1) block of iron, weighing 91.6 kilograms
&gt;  **Results:** Seven hours later, block of iron expelled from SCP-1829, completely undigested.
//Judging by Test 1829-3, SCP-1829 appears to &#34;give up&#34; on digestion if unable to break down an object after a certain amount of time. - Dr. ██████//

__**Test 1829-4 - 7/6/████**__
&gt;  **Subject:** Several iron shavings, weighing a total of 1.1 kilograms
&gt;  **Results:** As in Test 1829-3, undigested iron was expelled seven hours later.

__**Test 1829-4 - 7/6/████**__
&gt;  **Subject:** 4 liters of ipecac syrup
&gt;  **Results:** Seven minutes later, SCP-1829 violently ejected the syrup along with 17 liters of gastric acid, flooding the pool at its base. Cleanup and draining took █ hours.
//Let&#39;s not do that again. - Dr. ██████//
