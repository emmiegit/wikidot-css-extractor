__Archived Containment Procedures__:
METATRON.aic is to review videos uploaded to YouTube or other social media sites for the presence of SCP-6780.  Videos containing SCP-6780 are to be taken down and stripped of the anomaly.  The channel owners are to be amnesticized.  

Copies of SCP-6780 instances are to be stored at the High-Yield Data Storage Facility 1 at Site-43.

**Description:** SCP-6780 is a series of videos and written advertisements produced by GOI-5889 (&#34;**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/vikander-kneed-technical-media-hub | Vikander-Kneed Technical Media]]]**&#34;) that represents a public relations advertising campaign for a line of supplements known as //&#39;helth by dado&#39;//.  The verbal and audio-visual content of SCP-6780 appears to be attempting to extol the virtues of &#39;helth by dado&#39; through use of spoken and written testimonials, reenactments, and use of devices such as medical diagrams, which often do not display human anatomy.

&#39;helth by dado&#39;, [[[dado-hub | despite the apparent origin]]], is largely non-anomalous in content; examples of products in this line include coyerroodlquhhylx[[footnote]]A rebranded malaria treatment, marketed as a preventative treatment for all viral and bacterial infections.[[/footnote]] and dado brain plus[[footnote]]Consisting of 99% ginkobiloba and ginseng supplement, 1% salt.[[/footnote]].  SCP-6780 instances often portray the products causing significant mundane physical changes in the subject.

Individuals who view SCP-6780 become skeptical of testimonial endorsements concerning a product,[[footnote]]Even in person, as subjects will no longer trust product recommendations from individuals who are close to them.[[/footnote]] even products not featured in SCP-6780.  This compels subjects to research products recommended to them, ultimately showing a preference for generic products over well-known brand names.

Video instances of SCP-6780 typically involve testimonials of one kind or another, but can vary with unpredictable regularity.  Additionally, demonstrations of the product often end with undesirable results.

**Discovery**: On 11/12/2021, METATRON.aic noted activity triggering several flags for Vikander-Kneed activity on numerous YouTube channels.  Review of the noted channels revealed instances of SCP-6780 edited into videos uploaded.  Upon confirmation of the GOI’s involvement, members of MTF-Kappa-43 (“The Mediators”) contacted the uploaders, who were unaware of the inclusion of the instances.[[footnote]]Despite the instances resembling ads, they were spliced into the video files themselves.  It is unclear how the GOI managed this.[[/footnote]]  The videos were taken down, the channel owners amnesticized, and the current containment procedures developed.

**Wakefield:** I&#39;m currently using coyerroodlquhhylx as an alternative to vaccines.

**Wakefield:** Now, I don&#39;t ever have to worry about my children being negatively affected by vaccination. They&#39;ll all die by the age of twenty, just as God intended! Thanks, helth by dado!

//The garden dissolves into a beach scene.  The entity continues to walk, the camera following him.//

**Dado**: We at Dado Industries care about the well being of you – our customers.  It’s for that reason that we developed products like Coyerroodlquhhylx, which 100% could help in the treatment of some infections.  We in no way have repurposed a malaria medication to try and swindle the public during this time of trouble.  This is about trust, and we want you to trust us.

//The beach dissolves into a scene where the entity is getting into a luxury electric car.//

**Dado**: Trust in us like we trust in you.  And give us your money.  Because of that trust. Dado loves you.  Especially your purchasing power.
