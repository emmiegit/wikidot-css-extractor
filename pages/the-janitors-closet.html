    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>//You approach a closet on Site-30. A note is posted on the door. It states://

&#34;Heyo. If you&#39;re reading this, you have approached a dark and mysterious corner of this facility. You&#39;re also about to enter my personal living quarters. Yeah. I live in Site-30&#39;s broom closet. What of it? Anyway, if you go in there, you&#39;re gonna find a bunch of mops and some papers I found. Those papers are my own business, and I&#39;d rather you not read them. Cool?&#34;

&#34;-Janitor Worth&#34;

//You enter the closet to find a bunch of mops, brooms, a bucket or two. One such bucket is on the desk, and a bunch of papers are inside the bucket. On the side of the bucket, it says &#34;Level 1 Clearance Required&#34;//

//You look in the bucket.//

&gt; [[[SCP-3270|SCP-3270]]]: &#34;So, my aunt spontaneously turned into a cat. I thought that was kinda weird, so I dug through her stuff and I found this. Reported it to the doctors. And then they all turned into cats. I guess it was kinda weird.&#34;

&gt; [[[SCP-3358|SCP-3358]]]: &#34;[[*user Uncle Nicolini]] and I were taking a trip to Washington, when we were chilling with a few reality benders. We were pretty high, and they were going on about this invisible apartment building. I visited it, thought it was cool. But Nicolini ratted them out. Fucking narc.&#34;

[[include component:image-block

    caption=&#34;I listened to some of their songs. I&#39;m a fan of their album &#34;Everything You Do Is Fucking Garbage&#34;&#34;
]]

&gt; [[[SCP-3556|SCP-3556]]]: &#34;Honestly, fuck this thing. Doctor Beck made me stick this thing on my forehead. And this sticky note starts yelling about how I suck at cleaning. And at that point Beck had to come and get me because I was right about to burn this thing.&#34;

[[include component:image-block
    name=censoredbaby.JPG|
    caption=&#34;This was me back in my younger years. Back when I had hair and also was rich enough to afford a hat. Man, those were the days. Time flies, am I right?&#34;
]]

&gt; [[[SCP-3908|SCP-3908]]]: &#34;So, this thing is SCP-3908. I mean, I know that. But the file won&#39;t tell me anything else about the thing. Whoever wrote this should probably be fired. They&#39;re pretty terrible at their job.&#34;

&gt; [[[SCP-3744|SCP-3744]]]: &#34;Me and [[*user Keyii]] were doing Site-30 things, like mopping up dead folks and filing taxes. But then, we saw this dick who had an almost dead brother. Like, get over yourself man. We all have dead people.&#34;

&gt; [[[Site-30&#39;s Janitor|Site-30&#39;s Janitor]]]: &#34;Hey would ya look at that? Someone took the time to write a tale about ol&#39; Worth. Might I add, the mop is a rather unappreciated weapon. Simple, effective and cheap.&#34;

&gt; [http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/doctor-kakeworth The Bakery Of Magic And Mirth]: &#34;This file just keeps changing. It might be magical, but I don&#39;t want the doctors to take it. Finders keepers, ya know?&#34;

&gt; [[[Durbal 2 - This Time, It&#39;s Personal|Durbal 2 - This Time, It&#39;s Personal]]]: &#34;Sequel to one of my favorite films of all time. It&#39;s got a few too many love triangles for my taste, but it also has a scene where Durbal stabs another Durbal with a third Durbal. Good shit, would recommend.&#34;

&gt; [[[SCP-4557|SCP-4557]]]: &#34;Raccoons are, in my opinion, the worst. They get into the vents all the time and keep drinking the cleaners I use. But these bastards went above and beyond in accusing me of murder. Which, I did. But they accused me of murdering the wrong guy. Glad this bastard&#39;s in jail. Or, is it multiple bastards? I forget.&#34;</textarea></pre>
