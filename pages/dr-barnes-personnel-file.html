[[tab Personnel Overview]]
[[include component:image-block name=folder2.jpg|caption= Folder of Dr. Barnes&#39; personal history and work documentation from her baseline reality up to her last resident reality.]]

**Name:** Dr. Jamie Barnes

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Position:** Head of Extra-Dimensional Studies at Site-99

**History:**  Jamie Barnes is not native to this reality, instead originating from Universe **7382-Epsilon-Blue-Gamma**. 

At roughly 12:00 p.m. on 02/08/2015, Jamie Barnes spontaneously appeared in this reality in the center of Site-99’s Mess Hall. At the exact same time of her appearance, her counterpart in our reality, Dr. Jameson Barnes, slipped and fell down a flight of stairs in his home. He suffered a multitude of injuries and was subsequently pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. 

Believing her to be a hostile entity or perhaps a spy from a GoI, the Foundation took Barnes into custody and immediately put her under interrogation. The full log can be found below: 

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Access Dr. Barnes Interrogation Log&#34; hide=&#34;- Close Log&#34;]]

&gt; **Interviewed:** Dr. Jamie Barnes
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Agent Burkes
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** This interview was conducted shortly after Barnes’ appearance in Site-99’s cafeteria. It should be noted that Barnes appeared holding a manilla filled with various files concerning not only her personal history, but also SCP’s she has personally worked on.  
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Burkes:** So, you claim to be Dr. Jameson Barnes. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Barnes:** //Jamie// Barnes. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Burkes:** Right. Well, from the looks of it you could just be somebody trying to gain access to our database. Plenty of people want to impersonate Foundation personnel.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Barnes:** Oh give it a rest, Burkes. I know you better than half of the people in your department. Go ahead, test me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Burkes:** Alright, tell me what I told you when we first met. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Barnes:** You told me that my shoelaces were untied. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Burkes:** And?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Barnes:** And you proceeded to flick my nose when I looked down to check. Real fucking hilarious, Henry. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Burkes:** Guess you might be the real thing. A bit odd though that your counterpart in this reality died as soon as you got here. We lost a good man, Jamie.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Barnes:** It wasn’t my choice to make. Whatever’s inside of me...whatever’s forcing me to port...it makes that happen. It’s like reality doesn’t take kindly to two of a person walking around. It corrects itself, like some kind of algorithm. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Burkes:** Port? Can you expand on that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Barnes:** This is the sixth time it’s happened, I think. Maybe the seventh. I got a working theory on why it happens though. It seems like whenever things take a turn for the worse in the reality I’m in, I port to a new one. I can feel it about a week in advance, which gives me just enough time to gather everything I need to prove my identity in the next one. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Burkes:** So it’s like some sort of Self-Defense mechanism? How’d you get like this?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Barnes:** It all started when I picked up ██████.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Burkes:** Sorry, can you say that again?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Barnes:** I said that it started when I picked up ██████.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Burkes:** It’s like you’re underwater or something, I can’t make out what you’re saying. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Barnes:** Yep, that’s how it keeps me like this. Doesn’t let anyone know how it got this way. Figures.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Burkes:** Moving on, the O5 Council are currently debating on whether or not to have you fill the vacant spot left by your counterpart if you truly are who you say you are. Anything you’d like to put forth regarding that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Barnes:** Nothing’s really changing. You lost Jameson and you’re getting Jamie, that’s all there is to it. Plus, I’ve got the knowledge of seven or so universes under my belt, so that’s gotta be worth something.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Burkes:** Alright, I’ll relay that back to them. Hope it works out. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Barnes:** If not, there’s plenty of other realities out there. No skin off my back.
&gt; 
&gt; **[END LOG]**
[[/collapsible]]

A week after Dr. Barnes&#39; appearance in the baseline reality, the O5 Council unanimously voted to instate her as Head of Head of Extra-Dimensional Studies at Site-99, thereby replacing her counterpart Dr. Jameson Barnes. All documentation brought by Dr. Barnes is currently being investigated and copied. A list of all of Dr. Barnes&#39; previous host realities can be found below: 

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Access Dr. Barnes&#39; Realities Documentation&#34; hide=&#34;- Close Document&#34;]]

&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **7382-Epsilon-Blue-Gamma**
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** Dr. Barnes&#39; original reality in which she was born. There appears to be no major discrepancies between the two besides a few historical differences, one being that the William Jennings Bryan had won against Taft, making him the 27th president of the United States. This had no sizable impact on the rest of history, from what has been discussed with Dr. Barnes. Her ability activated shortly after picking up ██████.
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **6556-Delta-Red-Delta**
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** In this reality, the Foundation had a more lax approach to the containment of anomalies. Individual cells were scene as too &#34;barbaric&#34; and &#34;inhumane&#34; despite the dangers the inhabitants posed. Instead, anomalies shared group cells that worked based off their differences and similarities. Despite the danger this idea seemed to posses, Dr. Barnes stated she spent two years without incident in this reality until ██████ occurred, forcing her ability to activate. 
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **7786-Alpha-Indigo-Charlie**
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** In this reality, the Foundation&#39;s counterpart was a religious establishment known as the &#34;SPW Foundation&#34; whose motto was &#34;Sanctify. Purify. Worship.&#34; From what Dr. Barnes observed in her limited time working with the SPW Foundation, their main objective was the securing of anomalies they deemed to be descended from their God, Azalar. These anomalies were worshiped as extensions of this god and daily sacrifices to them were not uncommon. Dr. Barnes&#39; ability activated after she refused to take part in a daily D-Class sacrifice, causing what appeared to be a bolt of lightning strike towards her from the sky. 
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt;
&gt; **6666-Charlie-Emerald-Beta**
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** [DATA EXPUNGED] 
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **6787-Zulu-White-Epsilon**
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** Dr. Barnes appeared in a reality that seemed to be identical to her original at first glance. However, it soon became apparent that she was unlike any of the other humans. In this universe, every human had red hair and blue eyes by command of an unknown figure named &#34;The Overseer.&#34; Anyone born without these traits were fed to something referred to as &#34;The Beast.&#34; Dr. Barnes was forced to die her hair red and wear contacts by the Foundation&#39;s counterpart in order to better fit in with society. According to Dr. Barnes, her ability activated shortly after the Foundation revealed a plan to terminate &#34;The Overseer.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **1245-Foxtrot-Yellow-Golf**
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** Nearly identical to Dr. Barnes&#39; original reality, the exception being that the Foundation had created a way for humans to never need sleep, which they then released to the general public. Dr. Barnes stated that while productivity was extremely high and the rate at which tasks were completed was too, most seemed miserable and expressed a wish to be able to sleep again. Her ability activated when a steel beam broke off from a crane and nearly crushed her.
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **2442-House-Ruby-Echo**
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** Dr. Barnes arrived in a marshland with no buildings or signs of civilization in sight. After wandering for approximately two hours, she found herself surrounded by what appeared to be hostile quadruped humans that lacked any higher brain functions. They began to charge at her, causing her ability to activate. 
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **4567-Victor-Black-Whiskey**
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** Dr. Barnes appeared in a reality in which humanity had never reached the industrial revolution. The Foundation existed in a rudimentary fashion, their idea of containment being either locking the anomaly in a cage or throwing it in one of the many &#34;containment holes&#34; that littered the United States. Dr. Barnes observed a blinding explosion in the sky roughly a year into her time here, her ability activating soon after.


[[/collapsible]]


**Anomalous Properties:** While it has not yet been observed, Dr. Barnes claims to be subject to an unknown temporal anomaly. She claims that when the reality she resides in reaches a certain, “damage threshold,” she will find herself transferred to a new reality in which existence is not yet compromised. This ability is extended even further to her personal safety, as she also has stated that if any immediate danger would befall her, it will activate before she is killed. According to Dr. Barnes, this has happened around seven times since she picked up ██████. The O5 Council has voted unanimously to keep Dr. Barnes under close supervision as a precaution for the beginning of any reality or world ending event. 

**Additional Information:** Has an irregular amount of knowledge pertaining to Serpent&#39;s Hand and a [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/professor-volek-s-compendium-of-mysterious-pieces-and-tales specific tome] in the Library&#39;s possession. Further research is advised.

The Foundation knew that people would come out here in hopes of escaping the cities, so they did their best to poison the land in any way they could. What fruit or animals that still lingered were tainted, more likely to eat you than be eaten.&#34;//##

###FFFFFF|//&#34;The week was over and it was time to relax on the company’s dime. He climbed the stairs of SCP-4258 and quickly entered, closing the door behind him. Despite the dozens of times he’d been to the diner, he was still amazed every time he walked in and saw its bizarre patrons. Today seemed to be especially busy, nearly every seat except a few at the bar being full. He started to make his way to one of the closest stools, occasionally apologizing as he bumped into somebody’s tentacle or scraped past a pair of mandibles.&#34;//##

There’s a reason all the other departments avoid that place like the plague, weird stuff sticks to the D.E.A. like flies on shit.
