//A heap of papers falls onto the desk. The shift begins. God, the headache. The pen... where&#39;s the pen? Where&#39;s the goddamn pen? Ah... here it is. Time to calm down. Hand&#39;s shaking again. Harder than usual. Must be those pills? Did I take too many? At least I don&#39;t feel guilty for that girl. How old was she, again? I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t remember. Does anyone care?//

//So... The papers? Ah, yes, the work. Hard to concentrate... I must have overdone it with those pills. Well, now.//

&gt; Requesting a Class D subject, eunuch. The Foundation does not possess a Class D subject conforming to given parameters. Permit forced castration? __Yes__/No

//What for, I wonder? They won&#39;t tell me anyway, my access level is not high enough. The Committee has a hierarchy of its own.//

&gt; Requesting permission to use three (3) class D employees for testing with SCP-081. Grant permission? Yes/__No__

//They forgot to mention what this SCP of theirs does. A bureaucratic formality. If they tell me my access level is not high enough, I&#39;ll forward them upwards. Let them try their luck there.//

&gt; Requesting permission to conduct an experiment with Ethics Committee employees and one (1) light bulb. Grant permission? Yes/__No__

//Another idiotic joke. I wonder who is it this time? Looks like the science guys. Arrogant pricks.//

&gt; Requesting permission to use animals in an experiment with a memetically dangerous object. Grant permission? __Yes__/No

//Plainly laughable. Who cares about these animals?//

&gt; Requesting permission to forcibly euthanize a Class D subject. Grant permission? __Yes__/No

//Is it still common practice to ask about things like that? Odd thing is, they keep describing the same thing differently in different requests. How stupid can they be? We&#39;ve made a unified system for this, why can&#39;t they just maintain order? Anyway, it shouldn&#39;t be my concern. I should be concerned about my job.//

&gt; Requesting permission to vivisect a Class D subject in order to extract his liver which has mutated into a sentient and multiplying organism. Grant permission? __Yes__/No

//I don&#39;t even want to know what happens where these guys are at. I just don&#39;t want to know...//

&gt; Requesting permission to terminate a Doctor for divulging classified information to an outsider (daughter). See attached file EPI-14x for details.

&gt; Grant permission? Yes/No

//Tired. But maybe a respectable man&#39;s life depends on my decision.//

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ EPI-14x.&#34; hide=&#34;- EPI-14x.&#34;]]
&gt; Insufficient access level.
[[/collapsible]]

&gt; Grant permission? __Yes__/No

//I&#39;m afraid I was lying when I said I can forward them above. I didn&#39;t exactly lie, but the consequences... Who am I? I&#39;m so tired. Yesterday I sent a twelve-ye... That&#39;s it, she was twelve. What&#39;s next?//

&gt; Requesting permission for use of a chil... 

//No. Just no. I&#39;ll throw this fucking piece of paper away. Tell them I never received it. When it comes here the second time, I&#39;ll have to sign it. What can I do?//
-----
//Oh, it&#39;s thawing. The heap of requests is thawing. I&#39;m looking at the last request. Moral principles are worn so thin here. What am I thinking? Settle your mind, Greg. The last request. Yes, yes.//

&gt; Requesting permission to vivisect a Class D subject... 

...

&gt; __Yes__/No
-----
//The end. The shift is over. Maybe someday I&#39;ll become a chairperson. I&#39;m good at my job. A mechanism finely tuned. Foundation ethics, right. Now I must sleep. Maybe take some of those pills? I used to be morally sound. That was the term written in my psychological profile. Probably.//
-----
//A heap of papers falls onto the desk. Oh how I want to delegate this responsibility to someone else. Where&#39;s the pen? In my pocket, right. Have to clean the suit. Hand&#39;s not shaking. Guess that decision not to take any pills has paid off. Hmm... whom did I kill yesterday? A mutant liver? Fair enough. Who cares. Real decisions are made by chairmen and their assistant. I have a small-time, quiet but tiresome piece of a job. So, what&#39;s the agenda for today?//

&gt; Requesting permission for use of a chil...

//Breathe in deep, breathe out. Don&#39;t get nervous. Don&#39;t read it through. What if I say &#34;no&#34;? What if I don&#39;t? Will my conscience haunt me if I never know what I&#39;m dooming a child to? So frightful. And the day was starting just fine.//

&gt; Yes/No

//Hand&#39;s shaking again. Eyelid is trembling for some reason. Maybe I&#39;m having a neurotic disorder, or whatever it&#39;s called. Stay on topic, Greg, you can&#39;t escape this. You just can&#39;t. What ethics is in it?//

&gt; Yes/No

//Come **on**. Just highlight the goddamn word. I have a daughter too...//

&gt; Yes/__No__

//I don&#39;t give a fuck. I just... I just don&#39;t give a fuck about those scumbags that send children to the s... The phone is calling. Yes? Stalling? A Keter? Yes, excuse me. I understand. Please excuse me, this won&#39;t happen again.//

&gt; __Yes__/--__No__--

//Damn you, damn you all. I did not want to... Did not want to. Where are my pills? At home... Home... No! There&#39;s a shitload of requests here! I hate, just how I hate it all. They turned me into a simple data processing mechanism. And I wanted to be a judge. Dear Lord, if you do exist, please forgive those who take up this burden. How do they say? Amen?//

//Whew! A break!//
