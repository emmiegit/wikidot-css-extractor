The doors to the club swung open against the walls with a loud bang, barely audible over the intense rave music filling the neon lit room. [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7666 | Agent Calender]]] straightened her jacket and took care not to step on the  crumpled bouncer on the floor as she entered the club. Bright colours flashed over the Lust demons littering the the dance floor, dancing in piles of hedonistic pleasure as was to be expected. Or, at the very least what //looked// like dancing at first glance. Typically people tend not to dance horizontally.

Whatever. She came here to do a job and that&#39;s what she intended to do. Normally she&#39;d be protecting Director House&#39;s ass from some outside threat or, more expectedly, himself. But she was the only one qualified to search among the dregs of Undervegas and follow the trail of the target. Though, she had to bust a few heads along her way of course. Well, &#39;had to&#39; might be a bit misleading but heads were definitely busted and she got the leads she needed.

Calendar stepped into the club and peered through the fog of body heat and aerosolised sweat, scanning the crowd for her mark. Most were naked, a lot were probably not far off, and some likely would&#39;ve been better off if they were. Stains don&#39;t come out easy after a night in one of these clubs. A cacophony of all sorts of demons were enjoying every moment of the deep haze of pleasure that came with such an establishment, but what she was after was something a bit different.

Calendar had begun shoving through the crowd of various fuckubi before she spotted what she had been looking for all night. Sitting at the bar was a rather peculiar sight; a human dressed in a black hoodie and jeans. It was like he had been plucked right out of the middle of Vegas and hadn&#39;t even noticed the biblical lack of decency that was now surrounding him. But of course to Calendar, that was exactly what she was looking for. She had found her man.

She pushed the remainder of the crowd aside to meet him at the bar. Standing behind the man she laid a firm grip on his shoulder and glared down at him with a fiery expression.

&#34;You,&#34; she shouted over the music with a smirk on her face, &#34;You&#39;re coming with me.&#34;

The man didn&#39;t react immediately. His shoulders slumped beside him and he let out a light sigh. After a few moments spent with Calendar’s fingers on his collar, he took a shot from a pile sitting in front of him, and looked over his shoulder. His eyes were a shining and florescent blue, glowing so brightly it made the neon lights in the club seem dull by comparison. Calendar was slightly taken aback by the sight and tightened her grip, ready for him to make a run for it or, even better, put up a fight. Either way, she was sure he wasn&#39;t planning on leaving anytime soon.

[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7454 | Isaac]]] stared up at the demoness, wondering what he had done to this particularly sinewy and slightly sadistic looking individual that would warrant such an aggressive approach. Had he insulted her? Stole from her? Stolen her boyfriend? Her dad? Both? Isaac searched his admittedly fuzzy memory for any familiar recollections involving this towering mass of red muscle he found himself on the bad side of. But, search as he might, nothing came to mind.

Isaac looked back down to the bar in front of him and over to the scantily clad demon pouring drinks.

&#34;Sorry love, but if I broke your heart or whatever just know that I am truly, deeply sorry,&#34; he glanced over his shoulder again and smiled, &#34;Oh, and I&#39;m not going anywhere.&#34;

Isaac raised a hand to gesture the bartender incubus over to him.

Calendar&#39;s grip loosened as she moved around Isaac to lean on the bar next to him. She glared down at him with an even bigger smile than before.

&#34;As much as I&#39;d like to have a bit of fun before heading back, I am on the clock and I&#39;m technically banned from this club.&#34; Calendar pressed lightly into the bar she was leaning on, causing the stone surface to crack and fracture, &#34;Ya know, property damage and such.&#34;

Isaac scoffed as the bartender poured a large glass filled with a suspiciously viscous looking fluid.

&#34;Oh really? Same.&#34;

Isaac grabbed the glass and broke eye contact with Calendar briefly to examine it. His eyes glanced over to the grinning bartender, and back to the drink. Isaac&#39;s eyes narrowed at the rather suggestive fluid as he tentatively took a swig. Not bad, a bit dubious, but at least some part of it was alcoholic.

Calendar straightened up and began cracking her knuckles.

&#34;Last chance. You should know, I really don&#39;t mind taking you in by fo-&#34;

Calendar was cut off by the guttural sound of demon clearing his throat, or perhaps someone attempting to start up a weedwhacker, just as several large demonic bouncers surrounded them both. One placed a firm hand on Isaac&#39;s shoulder mid drink, as another came around to face them both.

&#34;Well, well. If it isn&#39;t the two biggest troublemakers on this side of the district,&#34; the fantastically muscled and pink skinned demon proclaimed, &#34;The living truck with anger issues and the world&#39;s most cream-filled twinkie.&#34;

Isaac, who had not stopped drinking the suspicious liquid, choked on his drink and coughed spilling it over himself and soaking his clothes.

&#34;Hey!&#34; said the now drenched and stained Isaac, &#34;I resent that sentiment!&#34;

The muscular demon boss adjusted his booty shorts and continued.

&#34;Why don&#39;t you two just scamper on outta here like the good little cockroaches you are, and me and the boys won&#39;t have to lay you two out, yeah?&#34;

Calendar shuddered and her fists clenched. Finally, nothing like reversing a few limbs to make a long night worth the trouble. The smile on her face returned as she eyed the gang of eight heavily bulked up demons. This was gonna be so much fun.

Before Calendar could wipe that cocky smirk off the pink wonder that had so unwisely picked a fight with her, Isaac stood up, wiped the liquid off his hoodie, and walked over to the flexing mass of living daddy issues. He stood there for just a moment, smiled up at the monster towering above him, and then delivered a truly ungodly amount of force directly into the demon&#39;s privates.

With a loud pop, time seemed to slow as the rosy tower was reduced to a crumpled heap in front of them both. There was a long pause as all the demons in the club were now eyeing the duo standing over the short shorts wearing deflated party balloon that was once recognisable as a lust demon bouncer. Isaac looked over to Calendar and smiled.

&#34;Oops.&#34;

In a flash, the remaining muscular demon henchmen rushed the duo as the club erupted into chaos. Calendar took the first move, grabbing a massive 13 foot tall monstrosity that had charged her by the arm and dealing a bone shattering blow directly to his ribcage. The hit sent the beast flying across the club into a far wall, causing the whole building to shake violently as two smaller creatures wearing leather tuxedos leapt into the air above her. Calendar spun around and pulled both her arms back, ready to perform some impromptu interior decorating to the ceiling. 

Isaac threw the glass in his hand across the room at the large red-ish orc thing that had pushed him down into the barstool earlier. The reflexes of the ogre were shockingly quick, catching the glass just before it hit his head and holding it while a smile stretched across his pug like face. As if in response to his smugness, the glass suddenly exploded into a fiery gaseous cloud of extremely fragrant perfume, sending him crashing across the bar and leaving him smelling like a dying rosebed. Isaac laughed and turned just in time to take a direct hit to the face by a chain-clad, taurus-horned demon, sending him flying over the bar into the rows of suggestively labelled liquor. He landed with a crash and let out a pained groan.

&#34;Ugh...&#34; grumbled Isaac as he flipped onto his back and let out a sigh, &#34;Fuckin&#39;... Minotaur lookin&#39; ass...&#34; 

Calendar stood with both her arms extended, fists letting off smoke as the two demon shaped holes in the ceiling dropped debris into the nightclub. Almost on instinct, she spun around with her leg extended and collided it with the side of bouncer&#39;s head who had tried to take her by surprise. The demon flew across the room and into the waiting downwards fist of Calendar, who had covered the distance in a split second, parting the demonic orgy sea like the world&#39;s worst depiction of Moses. The demon disappeared into the earth below, leaving behind no trace beyond a gaping hole and a pair of gently floating stockings. 

She turned to look at a chiselled dominatrix style demon bouncer holding a whip. The demon smiled at her and Calendar, of course, smiled back, before launching off the ground in the bouncer&#39;s direction.

Isaac shuffled across the ground with his back against the bar, picking up a bottle of vodka along the way. He looked over at the terrified incubus bartender hiding out of harms way. Isaac gave the demon a wink, before taking a large swig from the bottle and leaping up over the counter. Isaac tossed the bottle at the minotaur demon which shattered across its face. As it stumbled, Isaac clicked his fingers together, producing a small flame which he brought to his mouth, and then released a torrent of intense fire at the bull man. 

A whip crackled and snapped around the room leaving gashes across the floor and walls surrounding the two demonesses. Calendar launched several furious punches towards the scantily clad succubus, but she dodged each of them with the unrelenting grace of a cockroach against a can of bug spray. The succubus bent over backwards before flipping over Calendar and wrapping the whip around her arm, pulling it taut to bring Calendar to attention.

&#34;Easy now big girl,&#34; the succubus taunted &#34;Wouldn&#39;t wanna leave some marks on that pretty face would we?&#34;

&#34;Yours or mine?&#34; Calendar retorted before grabbing and yanking the whip with such force, the succubus flew over to her position. The succubus barely had time to react before being met with the titanium clothesline that was Calendar&#39;s arm. With a loud &#39;Grk!&#39; the succubus was now out of action.

The bull man, now engulfed in flames, ran towards a nearby fountain overflowing with lubricant looking to douse the fire. Isaac, in response, let out a shrill whistle. The apparently and understandably infinite amount of lubricant within the fountain sprang to life in the form of several large tentacles that grabbed the bull by the legs. The tentacles swung the bull around the room before firing him off like a bowling ball into a distant pile of demons, the slickness of the minotaur&#39;s body ensuring a clean strike.

&#34;Tell Daedalus he can keep the fuckin&#39; bond!&#34; Isaac shouted at the unconscious bovine demon, &#34;Now, who else wants some?!&#34;

As if to answer the unwise questioning of the fallen deity, a truly gargantuan beast sidled up beside Isaac and placed a massive hand on his shoulder. Isaac turned to look up to the red and fanged demon, bulging with muscle, just as the regret could truly set in.

&#34;Ah,&#34; Isaac muttered to himself, &#34;Fuck.&#34;

Calendar finished untangling herself from the surprisingly sturdy whip just as Isaac flew past her head at a horrific speed, burying him in a nearby wall. Calendar turned to look over the demonic goliath that now stood in front of her, as he brought his fist to meet Calendar&#39;s crossed arms. Despite the attack not causing any damage, the lighter Calendar was sent flying into her own crater right beside Isaac.

&#34;You know,&#34; started Calendar while climbing out of the crater, &#34;I really think I&#39;m starting to love this job!&#34; 

Calendar looked over to the battered and bruised Isaac.

&#34;I thought I&#39;d have to just drag you back like a spoiled kid, but this is way better don&#39;t you think?&#34;

Isaac painfully lifted himself out of his personal impression in the wall and glared over at Calendar.

&#34;Oh yeah, I&#39;m having the best time over here,&#34; Isaac responded, falling to the ground before lifting himself up, &#34;Are you sure you&#39;re not related to my ex by chance?&#34;

&#34;No idea what you mean!&#34; Calendar shouted down to Isaac before turning her attention back to what was one nose job away from being a literal elephant in the room, &#34;But hey, this guy looks like the last man standing. So you ready to wrap this up?&#34;

Isaac cracked his neck and stood up straight.

&#34;Yeah, fine. I really need a shower after this.&#34;

The demonic overlord laughed in a deep bellowing voice at the two puny rats standing in front of him. With a flex of his muscles he stood to full height, massive horns scraping the ceiling. His fanged mouth, like that of an angler fish, was grinning widely and dripping with saliva. He began cracking his knuckles in preparation for the absolute devilish beating he was about to dish out.

&#34;First one&#39;s mine!&#34; Calendar belted out before leaping off her position.

In a flash, Calendar closed the distance between the two and landed a devastating kick to the side of the massive demon&#39;s arm, causing him to stumble. But before she could draw her leg back for another blow, the demon then grabbed Calendar by the leg, and swung her around before throwing her across the room into the nearby bar where she landed on a liquor soaked bed of broken bottles and shot glasses.

Isaac leapt into action following Calendar&#39;s lead, sprinting towards the monster, grabbing a broken chair leg on the way. Isaac threw the chair leg towards the beast as it transformed into a swarm of rat sized wasps that began stinging at the demon&#39;s face. The demon staggered while swatting at the insects as Isaac slid under his legs and grabbed the whip left behind by the succubus who had undergone rapid unscheduled tracheotomy a few moments earlier. The whip transformed into a long vicious looking vine in Isaac&#39;s hand, which he cracked across the demon&#39;s calf and swung around the room. Everywhere it landed, various flowers, ferns, and even a number of trees began to sprout and grow rapidly, adding to the club&#39;s no doubt skyrocketing insurance claim.

The demon snapped his attention to the up-and-coming gardener that had somehow caused lilies to sprout from his ankle, and kicked his massive hooved leg backwards. The iron like foot collided with Isaac&#39;s gut, sending him rolling across the slick floor and into a support pillar wrapped up in roots, winding him. The tree had cracked under the impact and sap poured from the pillar into Isaac&#39;s hair, raising the increasingly sticky deity&#39;s shower time.

Calendar grabbed the shattered remains of the poor heavily beaten bar, and threw it at the monster&#39;s head. The counter knocked the creature backwards into a wall, with his horn impaling a large disco ball. Lights flickered off the beast as it moved rapidly towards the bar once more, just as Calendar launched forwards landing furious punch after punch into his gut and chest. The beast raised an arm to smash down on Calendar, but large, animate vines whipped out from behind him and wrapped themselves around his arm and neck, causing large flowers and roots to grow and from his skin and bark to encase him.

The demon looked back at the staggering Isaac, vine in hand, which had now split and come to life tangling the monstrosity in thorny, fibrous appendages. With a mighty pull, Isaac managed to yank the beast away from Calendar, who then sent a thunderous kick into the massive leg in front of her, shattering the bark and bringing the behemoth back down to his knees.

Isaac used the vines to swing up onto the horns of the creature and wrap his arms around one. He heaved and strained before a loud snap echoed across the room and the massive horn fell to the ground with an enormous thud. The demon screamed and reached for Isaac, but Calendar sent another blow directly into the monster&#39;s elbow, causing his arm to go limp. Calendar then grabbed the creature&#39;s leg, and with a loud yell, swung him around the room and sent him flying back into what at one time might&#39;ve been considered a bar. Isaac fell off the demon and landed with a stumble next to Calendar, still holding the whip.

&#34;Not bad for a scrawny little sprite.&#34; said Calendar.

&#34;Not bad for... whatever the hell you&#39;re supposed to be.&#34; Isaac replied.

The two glanced at each other and smiled, just as the behemoth began to rise to his feet again. He was glowing with a red hot aura that gave away his pure, unbridled rage. He let out a truly gargantuan howl that shook the foundations of the building before bursting into flames and charging at the duo once more.

&#34;Together?&#34; the two said in unison, before snapping their attention to the charging beast.

Calendar grabbed Isaac and threw him towards the mountain bearing down on them. The vine in his hands spun and whipped out at the beast, wrapping around it&#39;s neck. Calendar began sprinting at such a pace that the floor cracked under her footfalls, before she smashed into the monster&#39;s ribs with a thunderous crack. Isaac swung around off the beast&#39;s neck and back around to Calendar, who grabbed the vine and yanked it as hard as she could, causing the monster to fly through the air from the force. Isaac slid under the beasts airborne mass and let out a punch of his own into it&#39;s gut, causing a dazzling flash of light as the creature&#39;s body rippled like water before flipping over them both.

The creature came crashing down to Earth, likely causing what would be described as a hellquake by denizens for weeks to come. The beast, now completely and thoroughly dazed by the beating, only had a brief moment of clarity to open his eyes just in time witness a red fist bury his head under the flooring of the club. And with a final whimper, the goliath beast had been gloriously felled.

Calendar rose from the monster&#39;s body to look at Isaac, sitting on the floor. They both looked around the room at the devastation they caused and began laughing. 

&#34;Man... all I wanted was a drink,&#34; Isaac scoffed while looking at the smashed bottles across the floor.

&#34;And all I wanted was a good fight,&#34; Calendar retorted.

&#34;And all I wanted,&#34; an unknown voice echoed across the destroyed club, &#34;Was to have one night where I didn&#39;t have to clean up after the likes of you two.&#34;

A fancily dressed and androgynous looking demon stepped out from an adjacent room and into the light. Their skin was a light pink and they sported two large curled horns atop their head. Surrounding them was a large horde of very serious looking demonic bouncers, complete with suits and sunglasses. In Hell. At night.

&#34;Look at the absolute mess you two have caused here. Normally, I can deal with one of you in my club but the two of you together? Seriously, what the actual fuck did I do to deserve such an ungodly pairing? It&#39;s unfit for even us lust demons!&#34; the well carried demon chided.

&#34;Byleth!&#34; Isaac shouted with open arms, &#34;Good to see you again buddy!&#34;

&#34;You.&#34; Byleth snapped back, &#34;Your uncle should&#39;ve kept you far away from here, whore.&#34;

&#34;Whore?&#34; Isaac looked over to Calendar, &#34;They call //me// a whore?&#34;

Calendar folded her arms.

&#34;Your clubs were always so boring. Where&#39;s the fun? The action?&#34;

Byleth pointed over to the mass of bruised and groaning demons on the dance floor.

&#34;That //was// the action. You effectively reduced the action to a sopping puddle!&#34; Byleth paused, &#34;Well... an unintended kind of puddle at least.&#34; 

&#34;It’s not my fault they couldn&#39;t handle a bit of roughhousing.&#34; Calendar pouted.

&#34;Roughhousing?!&#34; Byleth shouted in an echoing voice, causing the lights to dim as their eyes glowed, &#34;You call this fucking roughhousing?! This is like calling the fucking apocalypse a &#39;warm Texan Summer&#39;!&#34;

The lights came back as Byleth brought their hand to their face, rubbed their temple, and sighed.

&#34;Can you two just, like, get the fuck out. I have a shit ton of cleaning to do now and I can&#39;t be fucked dealing with you two on top of this tonight.&#34;

&#34;Sounds like a plan!&#34; Isaac said while jumping to his feet, another bottle in hand. &#34;Lets blow this joint! I&#39;ve had enough ‘revelry’ for one night.&#34;

Isaac began walking to the exit as Calendar turned to follow.

&#34;Oh and by the way,&#34; Byleth shouted, &#34;All of this will be added to your tab. That goes for both of you!&#34;

Isaac and Calendar ignored Byleth as they stumbled out the front door into the cold night air. The strip was illuminated by a rainbow of neon lights from all the signs advertising strip clubs, brothels, pretty much every kind of underground form of debauchery you can imagine.

Isaac took in a deep breath then turned to Calendar with his arms outstretched.

&#34;So!&#34; he shouted &#34;Who and what was so important they sent a howitzer with legs to come get me?&#34;

Calendar folded her arms and glared down at the tiny trickster.

&#34;The Foundation. Something about you not staying put, House looked more annoyed than usual.&#34;

Isaac&#39;s smirk faded and his arms fell.

&#34;Foundation huh?&#34; Isaac looked down to the ground. &#34;Is... Riley upset with me?&#34;

&#34;Don&#39;t know who that is.&#34;

&#34;Right...&#34;

Isaac and Calendar stood there for a moment before Isaac&#39;s eyes rose to meet Calendar&#39;s.

&#34;Listen, you don&#39;t seem like you&#39;re in a hurry any more than I am.&#34; 

Isaac&#39;s smile returned as he moved his hands behind him and cocked his head to the side

&#34;How about we find a place to stay for the night before you, er, &#39;capture&#39; me?&#34;

Calendar looked around at the strip surrounding her. She was always fond of the night in Undervegas, and being back home felt somewhat &#39;right&#39;. She was sure that House wouldn&#39;t try something like fight a tank with his bare hands before she got back. After all, there&#39;s no way he wouldn&#39;t invite //her// along if he did, right?

Calendar let out a sigh and looked down at Isaac again, whose blue eyes glowed almost as bright as the neon lights surrounding them.

&#34;Alright,&#34; Calendar said to the sprite of a man, &#34;But I get to pick the hotel.&#34;

Isaac perked up at this and shot his hands into the air.

&#34;Perfect!&#34; he shouted before spinning around, &#34;Onwards then! To silken sheets and hot water, &#39;cause good god I need a shower.&#34;

Calendar scoffed as Isaac started to march off into the night. As she followed him down the street towards the hotel she pointed them towards, Calendar found herself wondering who exactly this guy was. The tricks he used in that fight, the cheerful vibe, hell even the fact he could take a punch or fifty made Calendar think there was so much more to this strange little man than she initially thought.

Calendar&#39;s mind wandered as they made their way into the night, absentmindedly listening to Isaac humming a strangely entrancing tune.

----

&#34;Don&#39;t break anything this time&#34; the sagging and crotchety hotel employee behind the counter warned the two as she handed them their key with long, speckled pink claws.

&#34;I won&#39;t.&#34; said Isaac and Calendar concurrently.

The demonic secretary attempted to hide her concern as she went back to reading a dirty magazine on proper horn maintenance.

Isaac and Calendar marched through the brightly decorated halls of the hotel to their room, and burst through the door. Compared to the aesthetic of the rest of the hotel, the room had an uncharacteristically  luxurious feel to it, with a large bed covered in silk fabrics, a large and impressive shower, and a number of rather suggestive sculptures all illuminated by the neon glow spilling in from the window.

Come to think of it, it seemed like the interior decorators had never designed anything beyond love hotels. But hey, that’s what you get staying in the Lust district.

&#34;Yes!&#34; Isaac shouted with absolute delight. &#34;A shower! Finally!&#34; 

Calendar had not so much as closed the door behind them before Isaac had removed his hoodie and shirt, and kicked off his shoes.

&#34;Hope you don&#39;t mind me taking one first?&#34; Isaac said while straightening his back and placing a hand on his neck.

&#34;Knock yourself out,&#34; Calendar scoffed, &#34;Don&#39;t actually though, I&#39;m not supposed to be babysitting you. I already do that for House as my day job.&#34;

Isaac snickered in response.

&#34;Well, if you were worried about that,&#34; Isaac&#39;s eye gleamed over his shoulder with a unusually piercing look, &#34;You could always join me.&#34;

Calendar blinked. For some reason that look had her finding trouble to find the words to respond. But before she could stammer out a retort, Isaac turned back to the shower and laughed.

&#34;Anyway, time to wash all the leftover demon out of my hair. Place was nasty even by my standards.&#34;

Isaac then moved into the shower and out of sight.

Calendar watched as she heard the water turn on and steam began billowing out of the cracked open door. Suddenly she felt a surge of rage. Did this little thing really just make her stutter? Stop her responding with a mere look? Was it a challenge? A threat? No! No, she wouldn&#39;t lose something so stupid to someone so puny! Calendar clenched her fists and gritted her teeth.

Alright. If it was a fight he wanted, it was a fight he&#39;ll get. She ripped off her jacket and stormed into the shower ready to show this little vixen who&#39;s boss.

Steam filled the air with an almost ethereal presence as Calendar entered and peered through the room, water coalescing on her bare skin and dripping over her chiselled physique. She saw Isaac standing under the torrent of the shower, his sleek and exposed pixie-like build accentuated by the flowing waterfall, the scene almost looking as if he thought a photographer was nearby. If Calendar didn&#39;t know better, she would&#39;ve sworn this boy was a high ranking incubus in disguise.

Isaac opened his eyes and glanced over to meet Calendar&#39;s who was standing there, steam rising from her body in rage, or perhaps some other passionate emotion. Isaac smiled, to which Calendar responded by storming up to the nude siren until she was standing inches from and above him, glaring down at his smirking face ready to tear him several new ones.

Isaac looked up at the monstrous and glowing red demoness, now covered in flowing water herself. It trickled down over her chest and onto her perfectly toned abs, and eventually over the clenched fists hanging by her sides. Isaac pulled his eyes back up to Calendar&#39;s just as she pulled back her arm into a locked position ready to fire a missile like punch in the young man&#39;s direction.

With a flex of her heavily muscled arm, the shot fired towards Isaac and barely missed his head. Her fist buried itself into the wall causing the tiles to crack and crater under the immense might as the building shook around them. Isaac did not break eye contact, nor stop smiling. Instead he simply tilted his head to the side to rest on Calendar&#39;s arm.

Calendar stood for a moment, taking in the otherworldly sight in front of her. This strange and fae-like man wasn&#39;t scared of her at all. Not only that, but he wasn&#39;t afraid to fight or even take a hit. And for some ungodly reason this made Calendar&#39;s heart swell up into her chest, like a boiling rage that would level the city if she let it out. But she knew one last thing that would make this wannabe challenger crumple. Her trump card.

Calendar reached out with her free hand and grabbed the side of Isaac&#39;s head. She pulled her fist from the destroyed wall behind him and grabbed Isaac around the waist, pulling him close to her and pressing him against her body. She scoffed once looking at the now doe eyed Isaac, before planting a kiss directly on his lips.

There. That&#39;ll show him.

The steam billowed and twisted in unnatural shapes as water droplets began to hang in the air around them and grow like miniature planetoids. The room lit up with bright pink and blue flickering lights as the various structures around them bent and shattered with their movements around the room. One listening in to this cacophony of lights and destruction might think a monstrous fight had broken out, if it wasn&#39;t for the echoing cries of pleasure shaking the foundations of the building alongside them.

Oh well. In the end, what&#39;s some more property damage added to the list?

----

Calendar woke up the next morning feeling unusually relaxed. Normally for this level of calm she would have to visit the gluttony district&#39;s spas, or disassemble a small army with extreme prejudice. She took in a deep breath and looked around slowly at her surroundings. The silken sheets of the bed she was laying in were wrapped around her waist. The room around her lied in absolute ruin with //no// piece of furniture left unscathed. A gentle wind blew through the room as the curtains gave way to faint flickers of red light. And in her arms, his head gently laying against her bare chest, was Isaac, fast asleep and none the worse for wear.

She stared at the impish boy with a strange feeling in her chest. She took a deep breath in and moved her arm up off his hip to his shoulder, attempting not to wake him.

Isaac began stirring and let out a whimper as he woke up from a deep sleep. His shining eyes opened slightly before dimming against the red light. He looked up at Calendar who had him in a tight but soft grip, a grip not he nor Calendar thought she was at all capable of.

Isaac stretched and turned to lay on his back, looking up at the demoness huddling him in her arms. He smiled and reached a hand up to hold hers, now laying gently on his chest.

&#34;G&#39;morning.&#34; Isaac managed to whimper out from a hoarse throat.

&#34;Morning.&#34; Calendar growled, clearly and with authority.

Isaac giggled before speaking again.

&#34;I suppose you&#39;ll be taking me back to the Foundation now, eh?&#34; 

Calendar waited a moment before responding.

&#34;Yeah, that&#39;s the plan. My way back comes through in a few hours and the next one won&#39;t be for a few days.&#34; 

Isaac let out a light sigh and turned to gaze out the window at the red sky.

&#34;But, you know,&#34; Calendar continued, &#34;I might be too slow to catch it.&#34;

Isaac turned back at the now smiling Calendar.

&#34;Shame,&#34; he scoffed, &#34;I guess both Riley and House will have to wait, huh?&#34;

Calendar laughed before wrapping her arm around Isaac&#39;s waist and onto his stomach.

&#34;I guess so.&#34; she jeered.

Isaac spun around in Calendar&#39;s arms onto his belly, with Calendar&#39;s hand now resting gently on his lower back.

&#34;My name is Isaac, by the way,&#34; he said resting his head back on Calendar&#39;s chest. “It occurred to me I never actually introduced myself.”

&#34;Calendar,&#34; Calendar responded, &#34;Nice to meet you, Isaac.&#34;

Isaac raised an eyebrow. &#34;Calendar?&#34;

&#34;Y-yeah...&#34; she stammered back.

Isaac flipped back around and crossed his arms over hers, staring up at the ceiling.

&#34;That&#39;s a nice name.&#34;

Calendar laughed again and stared up at the ceiling alongside Isaac.

&#34;Yeah,&#34; she whispered under her breath, &#34;Yeah it is.&#34;
