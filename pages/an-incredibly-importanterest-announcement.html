**NOTICE 03/04/21: Submissions are now closed! Judges are currently deriving the point totals from base principles. Thank you to all who participated! Points have been deducted from those who did not participate. If you submit now and we don&#39;t notice, however, that&#39;s BONUS POINTS.**

Time tells of an event long ago, when staff and user alike were stripped down, greased up, and sent careening down a monkey pit, were they proceeded to fight for HONOR and GLORY.

Well it&#39;s that time of the fucking year again, ladies and gentlemen. The time when, for two blackened days, we cast off the chains of professionalism and let the monstrous horrors within our heads and hearts out into the wild. Grown men weep, antebellum women faint, and everyone in-between barricades their homes in fear as absurd horrors roam the streets of the wiki. My fellow readers and writers, welcome to hell.

Welcome to the Creck Fec Centest 2: Deep Fractures.
An Unofficial, Community Run Contest.
[[/=]]

[[=image https://i.imgur.com/6mhuzXQ.png]]

+++ The Contest

You will write a piece of crack fiction for the site. The titles have already been chosen, and there are certain requirements that come with each title. Each level of difficulty will give you the chance to earn more and more points. 

+++ The &#34;Winners&#34;

The winners will be determined by a combination of judges and rating. The judges (who are entirely impartial) will be required to drink heavily before scoring, unless they don’t want to.

Bonus points are awarded for selecting higher difficulties. Further bonus points will be awarded if the subject of the story (if applicable) actually upvotes your story. Collusion and coercion are highly encouraged. 

The top rated stories will be forever immortalized on this page, one for each catagory, and will recieve the prize of carrying this great shame on their shoulders forever more.

They will ALSO recieve ONE DRAWING BY ME ([[*user Varaxous]]) of anything they choose, done in ms paint to the best of my ability. 

**NOW THAT JUDGING IS OVER AND WINNERS HAVE BEEN ANNOUCNED, THEY CAN PM ME TO REQUEST THEIR MS PAINT DRAWING. I&#39;LL PROBABLY ALSO SEND PMS.**

Thank you all for participating. It was a ton of fun seeing everyone&#39;s articles and seeing people have fun with it! 

+++ The Judges

The judges were hand selected by a double blind procedure by a council of elder warrior priests.

Then I forgot and just made it up on the spot.

The ones to blame: 

* [[*user Varaxous]] - The Furry
* [[*user Gekkoguy]] - The Not Scaly
* [[*user J Dune]] - The Normal One

+++ Being Classy

We at Ratmmunity Outreach implore you to be as vulgar and audacious as you possibly can. We&#39;re starting trash fires, not lighthouses.

+++ Rules

The basic rules of the contest are as follows:

# You must write a story using one of the titles. Once a title is claimed, no one else can write about it. You claim a title by editing this page and adding your name to the end of the title in the provided formatting, replacing the X under the &#39;claim&#39; column. Once you&#39;ve posted, edit again and make the title link to your page. 
# Collabs are allowed. All users in the collab must claim the slot.
# Your entry should be in the &#39;tale&#39; format. While it may include other elements from the site (SCP excerpts, for example), it should be a tale primarily.
 # The exception to this rule is the Tiamat category, which //must// be an SCP, -J or otherwise.
# Once posted, you may not delete or edit your entry, regardless of performance. Articles that dip into the deletion range are expected.
# Only one title per person.
# //**No Minions©**//
# Judges are given a list of things to look for in each piece of crackfiction, but they are also given the latitude to rule that &#34;they are just too drunk for this shit&#34; and award whatever they want.
# Bonus points may be awarded at the discretion of the judges. Whatever the opposite of bonus points are may also be unawarded at the discretion of the judges, //especially// if this rule isn&#39;t removed.
# Erotica, while not required, is permissible. //**However**//, it should be tagged &#39;adult&#39; and possess a short disclaimer. This disclaimer will not count towards any word count.
# Coldposting is a virtue.
# No whining. Points will be deducted for whining.
# Whine. Points will be awarded for whining.
# For all the talk about descending into hell and starting trash fires, have some sense. Have fun, but don’t break the site rules. 

+++ Time Frame

IT&#39;S OVER. YOU MISSED IT.

+++ Story Tiers

Bonus points are awarded for selecting a higher tier, as noted. Read above for claiming stories.
