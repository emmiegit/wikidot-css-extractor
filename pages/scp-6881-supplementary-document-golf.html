**GALLIO:** This is Agent Hector Gallio. The following is Classified Level 5 under Project Serapis. O5 Eyes Only. 

Investigation into anomalous events in and around Shibbet’s Vale, Montana, has revealed the police reports concerning a quasi-religious group known as the Children of the New Dawn that settled in the area in 1966 and remained until 1968. The circumstances in which they left Shibbet’s Vale are not recorded by the police. Going by the official record, the Children of the New Dawn just upped and left one day. That made me suspicious. 

During the course of this project, I deployed Foundation assets to infiltrate the state and local police and search for records and evidence potentially related to anomalous events. One of these assets, posing as a low-level employee of the state Department of Justice, conducted extensive searches of the department’s evidence depositories and found a cache of 120mm film canisters and 8-track tapes was sent to the Montana Department of Justice Criminal Investigations Department, some time in the 1980s. The tapes were either deliberately suppressed or not considered to have evidentiary value at the time. They were subsequently transferred to digital formats and sent to me for review.

These films and sound recordings were from the Children of the New Dawn’s occupation of a compound constructed around the abandoned buildings of the army base that once stood in Shibbet’s Vale. In particular, vehicle and aircraft hangars were repurposed for growing marajuana. The rest of the compound was tents and a few cabins. No definitive numbers exist for the size of the group, but the footage confirms a minimum of forty individuals resident there. After watching the tapes, I realised why they had been kept secret by the police, and why the Children of the New Dawn were gone.

The Children of the New Dawn was formed by Emile Nilsson, a petty criminal and amateur musician from San Francisco, California. I couldn’t find much on his early history, but he had several run-ins with the law in California including theft and drug offences. He was 28 years old when he arrived at Shibbet’s Vale with a small following in tow, and set up his combination of religious retreat and drug production facility. Other prominent members attested to by the tapes include Polly Pozniak, Nilsson’s romantic partner, Timothy Fisk, a former UC Berkeley chemistry student, and Eugene Grimes, a former car mechanic from Oakland. The Children of the New Dawn were an example of the ‘New Religious Movements’ that grew up in the 60s and 70s around San Francisco in particular, as an alternative to traditional religion. Most of them were benign, but a few, like the Manson Family, were not.

The tapes focus on the events of summer 1968, many of which were filmed live by the group’s members. Additional tapes are of sermons delivered by Nilsson, and numerous recordings of the music he performed during the group’s religious observations.

Seeker, just follow the way
Leave the selfish world behind
Come to where the children stay
Seeking to unlock your mind

[Chorus]
We are the children of a new dawning day
Following Emile’s way

[Verse 2]
Take a trip to make you free
Throw away those mental chains
Join us here among the trees
Never coming home again

[Chorus]
We are the children of a new dawning day
Following Emile’s way

[Verse 3]
There was a man named Emile
Sent to change the world they say
Teach the children how to feel
All who follow on the way

The following sound recording is not dated, but appears to be from the period after the Children of the New Dawn had established their compounds and begun to fortify its perimeter.
&gt; 
&gt; //(The ambient sound of an outdoors tent revival)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** Children of the new dawn! Some of you have come to me and asked, what lies beyond? Emile, you say, you speak of going beyond the prison of our minds, but what are we going to find there?
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** And I say, how can I describe what can’t be described? You have to abandon your senses, abandon the logic of your prison mind, just to see it! Of course our language, which was created by society and the establishment, can’t describe the unknowable. But I’ll try.
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** It’s the truth of the world. It’s the shape of things the way they really are. The people back in the selfish world, in their society, are afraid of the truth, because it says they don’t deserve their power and their money. They made the lie to protect themselves. But when you stop believing, when you let go of the way they say your mind is supposed to work, you see the truth behind. Everything changes, man! Two plus two doesn’t equal four any more! Up is down! All you can do to prepare is accept it’ll all be different. Open your mind, force it open, lever it open with the chemical sacrament!
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** Here ends the lesson, children of the new dawn. Brother Eugene and Sister Polly have the week’s assignments.
&gt; 
&gt; **Eugene Grimes:** Hi. Uh, thanks Eugene. So, Mark and Duane, you guys are on the latrines. 
&gt; 
&gt; (//There are groans from the audience//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Eugene Grimes:** Yeah ok, I know, but you guys were stoned on watch and you know the rules, right? And you cats from the campers are guarding the perimeter and the gate. I got a roster here. No sneaking away because that’s not groovy, we’ll be checking. Sister Polly has the agriculture assignments.
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** Candy and Maurice, your teams are tending the crop in the hangars again. Hester’s team, you try to get the vegetable garden going. Doc, just keep on doing your thing, the last batch was real good and the buyers want all you can cook. The rest of you, we got supply runs to do. We need gas and fertiliser, and also some, you know, some, like, actual food. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** Times are hard, children. But we knew they would be. These are the tribulations before the time of freedom! They will try to seduce you with their beautiful lies again! But you are stronger than they are. You are the children of the new dawn! You are the walkers on Emile’s way!

[AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - The following is the audio from a film recording that is not dated. It takes place inside a large, dark tent. The floor is covered with cushions. A man identified as Timothy Fisk, nicknamed ‘Doc’, sits cross-legged. He wears sunglasses and a lab coat over a knee-length shirt. A version of the full film with audio is available to rent from the site historical media archives with permission from the Site Director.

Portions of the transcript in bold are narrated by Dr. Gallio. 

&gt; 
&gt; //(The sounds of a small building with chemical equipment running, boiling fluids.//)
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - //(Polly Pozniak enters the frame and sits cross-legged on the cushioned floor.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Timothy &#34;Doc&#34; Fisk:** You wish to take the sacrament, baby girl?
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** Please. I need something, Doc. I need it bad.
&gt; 
&gt; **Timothy &#34;Doc&#34; Fisk:** Talk to your doctor. You got trouble inside. A real storm in there. I never seen you less mellow.
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** Emile. This place. It seems… I don’t know. Hollow, maybe? Like, Emile wasn’t always giving us the whole truth. Like he brought us here for some other reason. He talks about the unlocking our minds and him being the prophet, but where is the promised land? When do we get enlightened? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Timothy &#34;Doc&#34; Fisk:** You talked to him?
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** No. I’m scared. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Timothy &#34;Doc&#34; Fisk:** Fear was made by the Man, baby girl. It ain’t real.
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** Doc, you know what happened to Jessie? Or the girl from France, Seveline, Segeline, something like that? Remember them?
&gt; 
&gt; **Timothy &#34;Doc&#34; Fisk:** They fell by the wayside, man. The tree is always going to drop a few leaves. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** No, Doc. Emile and three of the guys went to Jessie’s tent. I saw them carry something out of there in a sleeping bag. Then Emile and the guys were out in the woods for half the next day. He said they were praying with him. Their jeans were covered in mud when they came back. I don’t think Jessie fell by the wayside. I think he’s still here, in the ground. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** And I heard Emile was sweet on the French girl. He was going to have a harem, like the Pharaohs, because they were gods on Earth and so was he. But the girl didn’t like it and I heard them arguing. The next day, Emile had bruises on his face and he took one of the men and drove somewhere, he didn’t tell anyone where, and came back late. I’m sorry, Doc, but I think the French girl was in the trunk. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** Those are just the ones I got reason to suspect had something bad happen to them. How many people have left? They’re gone one day, and we never see them again? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Timothy &#34;Doc&#34; Fisk:** You got questions, baby girl. Questions are like little beetles in your brain. They bore through it till you got nothing else left in there. You need answers. You done right to come to me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** Will the sacrament bring me answers?
&gt; 
&gt; **Timothy &#34;Doc&#34; Fisk:** This one will.

&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(Doc produces a small carved wooden box and opens it, taking out some strips of paper from inside.//)**
&gt; 
&gt; **Timothy &#34;Doc&#34; Fisk:**  Been seeking the bounty of the land, man. She gives us everything we need. Found these fruit growing up on the slopes, up where ain’t nothing should be ‘cept pine needles. I thought to myself, this is the land hearing us pray and reaching out when we need her. The land is the truth. I took one bite of her bounty and man, I saw the truth. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** Doc, I never saw no truth on a trip. I saw things change colour and my clothes falling through my body. People walking through the walls. I never saw what Emile promised I would. Is this gonna be different?
&gt; 
&gt; **Timothy &#34;Doc&#34; Fisk:** This is gonna be different, girl-child.
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(Doc takes one of the strips of paper and places it on Polly Pozniak’s tongue. She sits in silence for approximately thirty seconds.//)** 
&gt; 
&gt; **Timothy &#34;Doc&#34; Fisk:** Talk to the doctor, baby girl.
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:**  I’m sinking into the ground. Oh god, Doc, I’m sinking!
&gt; 
&gt; **Timothy &#34;Doc&#34; Fisk:** I’m with you, Polly. Ride the wave. Ride it out. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** I can’t breathe! It’s a bad trip, Doc, it’s going real bad!
&gt; 
&gt; **Timothy &#34;Doc&#34; Fisk:** Have faith, baby, Have faith. Look for the truth. Look through the fear.  You gotta find the truth, you gotta tear that sucker from the darkness!
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** I can see someone! Oh god, it’s so dark… help me! I can see you, help me! I’m here!
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(Polly Pozniak holds out a hand as if reaching for someone. Her eyes are wide and unfocused with dilated pupils.  Doc continues to watch her.)//**
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** There’s a stone house under the ground. It’s… it’s huge. It has columns and altars, like in Rome. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Timothy &#34;Doc&#34; Fisk:** What do you see?
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** Vines around the columns. Still growing. And flowers all over the ground. There are flowers under my feet. They’re carrying me. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** There’s a woman in the house. She’s tall, like a statue, and… her skin is green. She’s so beautiful. Please, take my hand! Hold me!
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:**I can see where she came from. It’s cold, and huge. It’s endless. I can see her running. She’s running away from… from someone. From rules that will ban her from being. She ran through the forest alone, away from her people.
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** She finally fell to the ground in a new place. She sank into the earth. And there’s a… a shell, like another skin, she grew around her to protect her. She’s still asleep, but she can reach out to us. She can touch the animals and the plants. It’s all, like a picture show in my head. I see the trees growing and dying, and new ones sprouting all at once. There’s no words but I understand.
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** She wants us to love her like her people loved her once. She’s been alone for so long. The people who come to her, they always go away. She’s always sad. She just wants to be happy.
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(Polly Pozniak begins to convulse. Doc kneels over her and holds her hands.)//**
&gt; 
&gt; **Timothy &#34;Doc&#34; Fisk:** Stay with me, Polly girl. Ride it out! Ride out the wave! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** Tell me the truth… hold me, save me… I love you…
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(Polly Pozniak stops speaking and appears asleep or insensible. Doc sits watching her until the film ends, approximately thirty minutes later.//)**

[AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - The following is the audio from a film reel dated to mid-July 1968. The camera is set up hidden and the picture is partially obscured. It shows the inside of a wood cabin decorated with brightly coloured wall hangings. Emile Nilsson enters, wearing a long tie-dyed robe. He is followed by a Caucasian man in jeans and a brown check jacket. Analysis of the film identified this man as Officer Steven Marklay of the Scarslow Police Department. A version of the full film with audio is available to rent from the site historical media archives with permission from the Site Director.

Portions of the transcript in bold are narrated by Dr. Gallio.
&gt; 
&gt; (//The ambient room tone sounds of a small wooden building. A door opens.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** Welcome, officer. You want a little something?
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Steven Marklay:** No, we keep our heads clear when we’re about business. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** Business? You’re the man come for his cut of the pie? I can dig, we all gotta eat.
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Steven Marklay:** Almost sounds like you’re talking about a bribe, Emile. That’s real offensive. I can’t believe you would hurt my feelings like that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** So the officer doesn’t want a toke, he doesn’t want a payout. What does he want?
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Steven Marklay:** He wants you gone.
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** We just mind our own business out here, man. If my people have been causing trouble in town, I’ll take care of it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Steven Marklay:** Your pack of stoners couldn’t stay awake long enough to start anything. I mean we want you gone. Vanished. Out of this county, out of this state. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** What did we do to you, man?
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Steven Marklay:** It’s the stuff, Emile. The product. Half the weed in this state comes out of this compound. Half the acid in the Mountain States, too. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** We had an understanding between us and the cops. We don’t bother anyone, we get left alone. If it doesn’t come from us, it’ll come from somewhere else. Someone way less mellow, too. Who do you think is gonna move in if we’re gone? Some biker gang or a bunch of mob guys, maybe. Probably selling speed or H too. Real bad karma shit. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Steven Marklay:** That’s the thing, Emile. We’re gonna move in. Us. The cops.
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** Oh shit. You’re taking over.
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Steven Marklay:** It’s pretty simple, Emile. We can’t keep the drugs off the streets. The next dealer’s always meaner than the one we put away. So what can we do but take over, handle it all ourselves, feed the need and put all the dealers out of business? And God knows the government doesn’t pay us enough for the shit we have to put up with, so we get ourselves the paycheck we deserve at the same time. Everyone’s happy. Except for you, Emile my man, which is why I gotta have this little talk with you. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** This ain’t some backyard operation! This is a church! You’re talking about burning down Temple Mount! Like, bulldozing Mecca, man! I’m not some dealer you can push around. I’m the prophet of the truth.
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Steven Marklay:** The weed ain’t even that good, Emile. This ain’t the climate for it. The acid is, though. Your Doc’s a genius. He can stay. And it doesn’t matter if you’re the Grand High Poobah of Upper Asswipe, all your holy bullshit isn’t gonna stop a bullet when we roll in.
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** My people believe in me, Officer Marklay. They’re not gonna just lay down.
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Steven Marklay:** We know. Some of these poor bastards actually think you’re what you say you are. That’s why when we come round, we’ll have all our brothers with us, all with guns, all ready to shoot. There’s damn near no official record of anyone even being here, and we know all the best places to bury a body where it’ll never be found. As far as the rest of the world is concerned you led your flock off into the forest and never came back. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Steven Marklay:** Or, you see through the weed smoke for long enough to make a good decision for once in your wasted life, and haul ass out of here before we drive a backhoe right through that gate.
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Steven Marklay:** I’m a nice guy so I’m gonna give you seven days. Call it due process. By then you can get across the state line even if you have to walk. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** I’ll give you guys a cut. I’ll give you half.
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Steven Marklay:** Not good enough, Emile.
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** I’ll give you a girl.
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Steven Marklay:** When we take over I can buy all the girls I want. Be gone, Emile. Seven days. I’ll see myself out.
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(Officer Marklay leaves. Emile Nilsson walks to the camera.)//**
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** Shit. Shit shit shit.

There are no police or other official records of the following events, but they are believed to have happened between the 18th-25th July 1968.

The following sound recording is not dated, but appears to be from the period after the Children of the New Dawn had established their compounds and begun to fortify its perimeter.
&gt; 
&gt; //(The ambient sound of an outdoors tent revival)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** I have walked through the valley of the shadow! Brothers and sisters, I have spent my time in the desert! I took the sacrament, and this time. I went further than I ever have. I was blind before. I thought I had unlocked every door there was inside me! But I went deeper, and I saw other walls the Man had put up. So I pushed on through them and broke them down.
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** I saw what the Man had been hiding from us. We got enemies out there. I know, how could anyone hate us, when all we do is love one another and make ways for other people to love? But they’re jealous! They want to break us down, because we know the truth, and they can’t bear to think of anyone else being happy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** They’re demons, man. They don’t have red skin or horns. Ain’t no smell of sulphur when they come by. No, they wear suits and uniforms, and friendly smiles. They wield the language of common good, and law and order, and public decency. They are the tools of the Man! But we got tools of our own!
&gt; 
&gt; //(A gun is cocked. There are sounds of alarm from the audience//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** Sometimes peace and love isn’t enough! They don’t act in love. They don’t know what love is. They don’t want peace. Peace is pain to them. They don’t understand our language of the truth. So we gotta speak to them in their own words. We gotta fight!
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** They’re coming for us. They’re out there and they know we’re here. And you know what? I bet they’re here already, all mixed in with us! Look to your brother. Look to your sister. We got snakes and rats right here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** Take the sacrament. Open your mind. Don’t just throw the door open. Rip the freaking walls out, man! All your thoughts, your personality, your memories, childhood, family, all that bullshit, throw it on out! ‘Cause it’s underneath you find the truth!
&gt; 
&gt; **Emile Nilsson:** They’re out there. They’re in here. The enemy. The Man. Brothers and sisters, you got to fight. And every fight needs a general. I am your prophet! I am your Napoleon! I am the truth!

[AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - The following is the audio from a film made some time after the preceding sermon was given, prior to the events of 25th July 1968. It shows the inside of a tent lit by a flashlight hanging from the roof. Polly Pozniak speaks into the camera. She appears distressed and suffering from lack of sleep. A version of the full film with audio is available to rent from the site historical media archives with permission from the Site Director.

Portions of the transcript in bold are narrated by Dr. Gallio. 

&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** I didn’t tell Doc everything. He got what I saw on film, but not what I saw after I passed out. I didn’t tell Emile, either. I don’t know why. It felt… private somehow. It’s the first thing I’ve ever kept from him. Apart from what I suspected he did with some of the people who disappeared, but I think he knew I knew.
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** The lady I saw. The green lady with the ferns in her hair. She took my hand and held me close. I told her I loved her, because there was so much love in her. And she said, look what I have to show you. Look what will come to be.
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** And she showed me a world of green forest and ocean. Mountains. Frozen valleys. Deserts. We flew over it together. She told me it was the future she would bring us. But there were no people. We passed over cities that had fallen down, covered in trees. The windows of the buildings were like the eye sockets in a skull. The cars were all rusted and turned over, and tangled up in the roots. There were ships washed up on the shores of the oceans. Planes lying where they had fallen.
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** Then she brought us down low into one of the forests where these huge trees rose as high as mountains. Their roots came up above the ground like nests of black worms. She pointed at the roots and I looked closer. There were bones down there. I saw skulls and pelvises with roots running through them. And ribcages, and thousands other ones I couldn’t identify, deep in the earth. I knew what had happened without her having to tell me. Their flesh was the earth the forest drew sustenance from. Thousands of them for each tree, and millions of trees, all over the world, so tall there were clouds around their branches. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** She was showing me a world of death. It was full of life, but it all came out of death. She was so sad, the lady, so lonely and sad, but she was angry, too. We had chased her out of her home, and she was never going to be anyone’s prey again. She was going to hunt us instead, and turn us into her world of death.
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** I don’t know what it means. Is it a riddle I have to solve? Where the things I saw mean something else, and I have to work it out? Doc used to talk a lot about that. He said the things you see when you take the sacrament aren’t just random trips, but they all have meaning, like dreams, and the truth’s in there somewhere. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** But what if it’s real? It felt so different this time. What if the lady really is here somewhere, and what she showed me really was the future?
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** What is she going to do to the world if she wakes up, or becomes real, or whatever it is she wants? And what would happen to us?

[AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - The following is the audio from a film taken shortly before July 25th 1968. It is taken at night and starts out as a tour of the old military base hangars used for growing crops, mainly marajuana. The camera is held by Eugene Grimes who cannot be seen but whose voice can be heard as he greets the workers tending the plant beds in the hangars. The workers wear a mixture of ragged casual clothes and white or tie-dyed robes. A version of the full film with audio is available to rent from the site historical media archives with permission from the Site Director.

Portions of the transcript in bold are narrated by Dr. Gallio. 

&gt; 
&gt; //(Ambient noise of an aircraft hanger. There is the sound of people handling tools//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Eugene Grimes:** My man! Tending the good crop, the bounty of the earth!
&gt; 
&gt; **Unidentified worker:** Hey, Brother Eugene. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Eugene Grimes:** How’s the sacred harvest, man?
&gt; 
&gt; **Unidentified worker:** It’s ok, I guess. Kinda rough but it gets you there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Eugene Grimes:** Bringing us one step closer to the truth here, brother.
&gt; 
&gt; **Unidentified worker:** If the truth is you really want to eat a cheeseburger and fall asleep then for sure.
&gt; 
&gt; **Eugene Grimes:** Truth be your dawn, brother!
&gt; 
&gt; **Unidentified worker:** Sure Eugene.
&gt; 
&gt; //(Tires squeal outside as a car rushes past//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Eugene Grimes:** What the hell was that? Sounded like a drag race.
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(Emile turns the camera off and the film ends.)//**
&gt;//(Eugene Grimes takes the camera outside, where it films the brake lights of a car heading away from him towards the compound gates. The car stops and a figure gets out. Eugene Grimes runs closer and sees it is Emile Nilsson.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Eugene Grimes:** Emile! Hey, Emile! What’s going on?
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(Emile Nilsson unlocks the gate and gets back into the car before Eugene Grimes can get close. The car speeds through the gate and down the track leading away from the compound, spraying mud and stone as its wheels spin.)//**
&gt; 
&gt; **Eugene Grimes:** Where you going? Emile! Emile, don’t leave us! Don’t go! Don’t go…

[AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - The following is the audio from a film recorded on the morning of 25th July 1968. It shows Polly Pozniak sitting outside her tent, talking to the camera. It is evident she has been crying. A version of the full film with audio is available to rent from the site historical media archives with permission from the Site Director.

Portions of the transcript in bold are narrated by Dr. Gallio. 

&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** I just don’t understand the world with Emile gone. What does anything mean without him? I haven’t spent a day without him since I left San Diego. God, it’s just so… hollow. So empty, now. I don’t even know if there is a Polly any more without him. Part of me says he hasn’t really gone, but I know he has. I just know. Like the way I knew when I was a little girl and our cat died. I walked into the apartment and it was so still and quiet. I just knew. This place is like that now. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** Is the truth the same now? It is what Emile preached? Or is it…
&gt; 
&gt; //(A woman screams. There are raised voices in the distance.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** Oh god. What’s happening?
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(Polly Pozniak picks up the camera and carries it as she heads towards the disturbance. Other compound inhabitants are walking in the same direction. It becomes apparent the source is a group of people gathered by the perimeter fence. As the camera approaches them. Eugene Grimes runs towards it.)//**
&gt; 
&gt; (//There is a babble of confused voices from the crowd.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Eugene Grimes:** Sister Polly! Don’t look. Please, don’t look!
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** What is it, Eugene? Let me see!
&gt; 
&gt; **Eugene Grimes:** Please. You can’t handle it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** What’s the supposed to mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **Eugene Grimes:** I’m sorry, you have to go. We’ll… we’ll deal with it. Somehow.
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** Out of my way, Eugene.
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(Polly Pozniak pushes her way through the small crowd. They are looking down at something on the ground, positioned as if it has been thrown over the fence from outside the compound.)//**
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** //(screaming)//
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(The camera briefly focuses on the object. The film must be paused to get a clear view of it. The object is Emile Nilsson’s severed head.)//**

[AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - The following is the audio of a film taken in the afternoon of 25th July 1968. The camera is placed at waist height, watching the main gate of the compound. A group of the Children of the New Dawn have gathered there, many of them with bags or suitcases. Eugene Grimes runs into frame. A version of the full film with audio is available to rent from the site historical media archives with permission from the Site Director.

Portions of the transcript in bold are narrated by Dr. Gallio. 

&gt; 
&gt; **Eugene Grimes:** You can’t go! This is a test! We have to hold on, we have to make it work! We can still see the truth!
&gt; 
&gt; **Unidentified cultist:** It’s over, Eugene. He’s gone. He’s dead! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Eugene Grimes:** Come on, man! You gonna give up what we’ve made?
&gt; 
&gt; **Unidentified cultist:** We live in freaking tents, man! The only one who wasn’t out in the mud and rain was Emile! We can’t grow spit in this ground, we just pray and dig all day, Emile gets everyone’s girl and if we leave we disappear forever. We got families out there somewhere.
&gt; 
&gt; **Eugene Grimes:** You got family here!
&gt; 
&gt; **Unidentified cultist:** Not any more.
&gt; 
&gt; (//A loud engine sound approaches.//)
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(The argument ceases as a large vehicle can be heard approaching.)//** 
&gt; 
&gt; (//There is a crash of breaking metal. Voice raise in alarm and begin screaming. In the distance several car engines rev.//)
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(A bulldozer crashes through the main gate. The crowd there scatters. The bulldozer drives clear of the ruined gate and several cars drive through, each with a number of men. The men, in plain civilian clothes, are all armed. Though they wear no uniforms, they can be assumed to be police officers as among them is Officer Steven Marklay and they carry a mixture of Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10 revolvers and Remington Model 870 shotguns, both standard issue to police forces in the area at the time.)//**
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Steven Marklay:** You had your warning! Your Messiah left you to face the music! Now you’re gonna dance!
&gt; 
&gt; (//There is gunfire, and screams.//)
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(Officers open fire, taking cover behind their cars as a few return shots come from the Children of the New Dawn. It is not known how many weapons the group possessed, but there is little return fire from them and they appear heavily outmatched. It is difficult to make out details of the conflict aside from the frequency of gunfire recorded on the film’s audio. The police officers spread out, firing as they move.)//**
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:** This is my land! The earth and the trees and the mountains!
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Steven Marklay:** That’s Emile’s girl! Take her out!
&gt; 
&gt; (//A volley of gunfire.//)
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(The camera is knocked over and the rest of the recording is rotated ninety degrees. Polly Pozniak enters the frame, alone and unarmed. She is barefoot and wearing a tattered white knee-length dress. Several shots hit her in the torso and limbs and she falls to her knees.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Polly Pozniak:**  You killed the old truth. I am the new truth.
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Steven Marklay:** Must be PCP. Dumb broad doesn’t know she’s dead.
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(Officer Marklay walks up to Polly Pozniak and puts the barrel of his gun to her forehead.//)
&gt; 
&gt; (//There is the sound of wood ripping through flesh and bone.//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Steven Marklay:** (//screaming//)
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(Bloody protuberances of woody material, like tree roots, erupt from beneath the skin of Polly Pozniak’s back and shoulders. Several of them puncture Officer Marklay’s body and lift him off the ground. Polly Pozniak stands up again and the earth beneath her breaks and ripples. Roots emerge from the ground to ensnare the other officers.)//**
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(Polly Pozniak is hit by more gunfire but shows no effect. Her head lolls to one side and her arms and legs are motionless, but the rootlike growths continue to erupt from her body and the earth around her. One police officer can be seen at the edge of the frame being dragged under the ground. Another crawls through the dirt with blood running from his mouth and a length of torn-off root still protruding from where it has impaled him below the chin. One of the cars sinks into the earth, dragged down by roots looping through its windows and around its wheels.)//**
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(From the sounds on the recording, several other officers are maimed or killed by the sudden growths, and the rest either keep firing or quickly retreat. The sounds of compacted metal suggests more cars are destroyed. The body of Polly Pozniak is conveyed on a web of roots across the frame, dragging the corpse of Officer Marklay behind it.)//** 
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(The camera is suddenly jerked away from the scene as if it has been picked up, and after a few moments of rapid movement and panicked breathing, the recording ends.)//**

[AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - The following is the sound from a film recording that takes place some time after the afternoon of 25th July 1968, probably the same night. The camera is set up in an area of darkened forest. Eugene Grimes, still wearing a mud-covered tie-dye robe, speaks to the camera. This is believed to be the final recording from the evidence the Foundation recovered concerning the Children of the New Dawn. A version of the full film with audio is available to rent from the site historical media archives with permission from the Site Director.

Portions of the transcript in bold are narrated by Dr. Gallio. 


&gt; 
&gt; (//Chirping crickets. Feet crunching on leaves//)
&gt; 
&gt; **Eugene Grimes:** They’re gone. They’re dead or run away. The cops too. I don’t know what the authorities will do, or if they’ll ever know. I’m not going to find out. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Eugene Grimes:** Polly talked about living off the land, and the earth providing everything we need. I believe her. What she saw in the sacrament, it was real. Maybe Emile’s truth was real, too, but I never saw it. Polly’s, I saw. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Eugene Grimes:** The forest and the mountain will help keep me alive. The people who lived here long ago knew that. We would dig up the things they left behind when we were ploughing for the vegetable patch. Maybe the truth is there, too, in the ground. The truth of those people.
&gt; 
&gt; **Eugene Grimes:** I don’t know how much longer this thing has to run and I didn’t grab any more film for it when I ran. So, this is probably it from me. Brother Eugene, Child of the New Dawn. Find your truth, brothers and sisters. Break down the walls and find your truth.
&gt; 
&gt; [AUDIO DESCRIPTION] - **//(Eugene Grimes turns off the camera, and the recording ends.)//**

[[collapsible hideLocation=&#34;both&#34; show=&#34;SHOW — COMMENTARY — DR. GALLIO: Children of the New Dawn [CLASSIFIED 5/SERAPIS]&#34; hide=&#34;− HIDE&#34;]]
**GALLIO:**

Records of the events of 25th July 1968 cannot be found in the archives of local or state police. The Scarslow Police Department have proven adept at covering up the anomalous events in and around Shibbet’s Vale, and they may have learned many of those skills hiding the aftermath of their unlawful attack on the Children of the New Dawn compound. Officer Marklay and several other personnel simply vanish from the police department’s employment records. The fates of the Children of the New Dawn are similarly obscure. If any survivors told of what happened at the compound, their stories never spread. 

While it is unlikely a definitive identification can ever be made, the unknown adult male body recovered from Camp Apesawa following the murders there in 1987 is consistent with Eugene Grimes. 

All recovered information has been collated under Project Serapis. This information is classified Level 5, O5 eyes only. Agent Hector Gallio, signing off.
