**Item #:** SCP-3532

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation webcrawlers are to monitor popular social media platforms for activity from SCP-3532. Any activity is to be recorded, scanned for cognitohazards, and archived. Foundation personnel are forbidden interaction with social media accounts associated with SCP-3532 unless given explicit orders otherwise. In accordance with Procedure 24-Lehonot, information damaging to the public image of SCP-3532 is to be produced wherever and whenever applicable. In the event that Procedure 24-Lehonot were to be rendered ineffective, all platforms hosting active SCP-3532 accounts are to be taken offline or otherwise rendered inaccessible until containment can be reestablished. 

**Description:** SCP-3532 is believed to be an entity previously worshipped as a deity at an indeterminate point in the past. Recovered documentation[[footnote]]//See Addendum A.//[[/footnote]] suggests SCP-3532 currently resides in an extra-spatial plane and can interact with standard reality through forms of long distance communication. Currently, SCP-3532 is known to the public as ███████ █████████, a popular social media advertiser and influencer. SCP-3532 currently prioritizes the growth of its cult-like following, known as &#34;The Miraculous Church Gang&#34;[[footnote]]//Hereby referred to as GoI-3532-1.//[[/footnote]], using its social media presence to do so. SCP-3532 has displayed a basic understanding of the creation of cognitohazardous imagery, and will often include cognitohazardous elements in its posts online. Testing has shown that the cognitohazards employed by SCP-3532 do not force the observer to perform an action, but instead act as a strong suggestion to do so. Further testing indicates that a negative perception of SCP-3532 can counteract the cognitohazardous effects.[[footnote]]//See Addendum B.//[[/footnote]]

SCP-3532 was discovered on 1/19/18, when several video files containing level 2 cognitohazardous patterns were detected by Foundation webcrawlers. The files were uploaded to the Instagram and Twitter social platforms by accounts belonging to SCP-3532, and featured the entity advertising products from [REDACTED], as well as GoI-3532-1 branded merchandise. The cognitohazards found in the files would compel viewers to both purchase the featured products and follow the several social media accounts of SCP-3532. At the time of discovery, there were no other viewable posts on either accounts.

Investigations into SCP-3532 owned accounts revealed a number of deleted posts made prior to 1/19/18, with the earliest being dated 11/28/17. Said posts differ from the more recent posts and indicate a lack of understanding on how social media operates. In these posts SCP-3532 appears to beg for followers on its accounts and ponders why other users have more followers on their accounts.

The sudden shift in post coherency coincides with SCP-3532 acquiring representation from social media managing company ████ Marketing[[footnote]]//Hereby referred to as GoI-3532-2.//[[/footnote]] on 1/3/18. It is assumed SCP-3532 utilized cognitohazards similar to those found in its posts to acquire representation. Upon receiving representation, most of the posts uploaded to SCP-3532 accounts were made by GoI-3532-2 employee Mark Gouse[[footnote]]//Hereby referred to as PoI-3532-1.//[[/footnote]].

As of 4/5/18, SCP-3532 has secured advertising deals with ██ major brands. It does not appear that SCP-3532 used its cognitohazardous effects to secure these deals, rather it seems that these companies reached out to SCP-3532 on their own accord due to the entity&#39;s popularity.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Addendum A: MTF Phi-1 Infiltration, Recovered Document 3532 24a&#34; hide=&#34;- Addendum A: MTF Phi-1 Infiltration, Recovered Document 3532 24a&#34;]]On 5/13/18, a detachment of MTF Phi-1 (&#34;Hostile Takeover&#34;) infiltrated the main offices of GoI-3532-2 in order to acquire documentation concerning SCP-3532. A notable document acquired in the raid was a pdf file of GoI-3532-2&#39;s contract with SCP-3532.[[footnote]]//File designated &#39;Recovered Document 3532 24a&#39;.//[[/footnote]] Cross referencing Recovered Document 3532 24a with other recovered contracts shows a number of deviations, such as the term &#34;client&#34; being replaced with &#34;Miraculous Being&#34; and &#34;manager&#34; with &#34;Miraculous High Priest&#34;. Other notable aspects include a clause stating the contract can only be altered by SCP-3532 and no other persons, as well as a separate clause stating GoI-3532-2 reserves the right to retract representation for clients deemed unprofitable or harmful to the image of the company[[footnote]]//While this clause is not unique to Recovered Document 3532 24a, its inclusion allowed for current containment procedures and Procedure 24-Lehonot to be established.//[[/footnote]]. Due to the concern that SCP-3532 could easily influence other companies in a similar manner, Procedure 24-Lehonot was drafted in order to suppress the entity&#39;s influence. Procedure approved on 5/20/18.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Addendum B: 24-Lehenot, Containment Established&#34; hide=&#34;- Addendum B: 24-Lehenot, Containment Established&#34;]] On 5/21/18, Procedure 24-Lehonot was enacted. A detachment of MTF Phi-1 was tasked with replacing key members of GoI-3532-2 upper management with Foundation agents in order to gain control of the company. Once the company was successfully under Foundation influence, PoI-3532-1 was replaced by Agent Jeffery Burr. Agent Burr then attempted to alter the social media persona of SCP-3532 to one that would be seen as undesirable.

&gt; 
&gt; Hello Lord ███████,
&gt; I&#39;ve noticed as of late that your posts aren&#39;t getting as much attention as they were before. I&#39;m afraid that your current posts are not being perceived as &#34;cool&#34; or &#34;hip&#34;. If these patterns continue, your numbers will fall, just like they have been for the past month. With your permission, of course, I&#39;d like to make a few changes to your image that will ensure that you remain &#34;groovy!&#34; as your age demographic would say. You can read them in the enclosed file below.

&gt; 
&gt; hello new priest.
&gt; in my contract it says that i make the final calls on whether or not my posts change, and i want to give your wanted changes a biggest no from me. 
&gt; mark goose (the old better you) knew much more and wasnt bad like you and i am alloweed to tell you that because its in my contract. 
&gt; anyway no you are to contu=inue posting as how mark did because he wasnt bad
&gt; thanks for the email

All further attempts to persuade SCP-3532 into altering its persona failed. It was determined that SCP-3532 could only be influenced by someone it perceived as having a better understanding of social media. In order to successfully alter the online persona of SCP-3532, Site-72 authorized the use of social media accounts belonging to [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3331| SCP-3331-Alpha]]] to contact SCP-3532. Agent Burr was instructed to contact SCP-3532 posing as SCP-3331-Alpha and alter the entity&#39;s perceptions of current social trends.

Following the dialogue, SCP-3532 instructed Agent Burr to follow the advice from the SCP-3331-Alpha account regarding the social media accounts, to which Agent Burr complied. Within two months, the number of visitors to SCP-3532 run accounts had dropped by 95%. At this point, GoI-3532-2 retracted its representation of SCP-3532 in accordance with the company&#39;s contract. SCP-3532 attempted to contact other social media managing companies seeking representation but to no avail. On 7/18/18, SCP-3532 made one final post to all of its accounts, reading &#34;i just wanted followers againn&#34; before deleting the accounts shortly after. No new accounts or posts or have been observed since.
