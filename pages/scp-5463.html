**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-5463 is stored in Containment Chamber S-030 at Site-272.  It is to only be removed from this chamber for testing and/or maintenance purposes.

**Description:**  SCP-5463 is a thaumatologically-induced conceptual amalgamation of a custom-built personal computer and a 1997 Ford F-150 pickup truck.  The personal computer component, along with an accompanying computer desk and office chair, was the object&#39;s original state and retains this appearance at all times, regardless of which conceptual property is being directly accessed.  Observers of SCP-5463 are immediately able to recognize it as both a PC and a truck.  Those familiar with the Ford F-Series are able to identify its make and model, with ~75% of said observers further recognizing its specific year of manufacture.

Despite having no actual vehicular parts in its physical build, SCP-5463 can be used as either a PC or a truck.  It has proven capable of running all tested computer programs compatible with its operating system[[footnote]]Microsoft Windows 10.[[/footnote]] as well as towing up to one metric ton of cargo.  The only difference from a standard 1997 Ford F-150 thus far discovered is an engine conversion from gasoline to electric.

Testing of direct interaction with SCP-5463 has shown that subjects familiar with one of its components but not the other are able to more comfortably operate the object in either mode than they would be otherwise.  Subjects knowledgeable regarding vehicular mechanics are able to identify SCP-5463&#39;s computer parts as either directly or roughly equivalent to truck parts.  For example, the wheels of the office chair are seen as the truck&#39;s wheels and tires, the power supply unit as the battery, and the case as the body.  These parts can be replaced, with the new part becoming subject to the object&#39;s conceptual amalgamation and the old part becoming non-anomalous.

SCP-5463 was discovered and subsequently contained following a traffic accident in which its owner Mr. David [[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]Burton[[/span]] crashed it into a ditch approximately 2 km south of Broken Cliff, MO, USA.  The object sustained minor damage which has been repaired by Dr. Janice Bell with assistance from the Site-272 automotive repair crew.

[[collapsible show=&#34;[Access Interview Log 5463/01]&#34; hide=&#34;[Close Interview Log 5463/01]&#34; hideLocation=&#34;both&#34;]]
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Janice Bell
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewee:** Mr. David [[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]Burton[[/span]]
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Bell:**  Good evening, Mr. [[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]Burton[[/span]].  My name is Dr. Bell, and I&#39;m here to ask you a few questions.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. [[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]Burton[[/span]]:**  Hell, didn&#39;t know I banged my truck up so bad it needed a doctor.  Is it still runnin&#39;?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Bell:** We&#39;re still working on the repairs, but I think it&#39;ll be fine.  Now, Mr. [[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]Burton[[/span]], may I ask exactly where you procured your vehicle?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. [[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]Burton[[/span]]:**  You can ask me anything you like, missy, just call me Dave while you do it.  It was a gift from my grandson, Bobby[[footnote]]Robert [[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]Marrion[[/span]] has been designated PoI-5463-01 and at time of writing is being sought for questioning.[[/footnote]].  He&#39;s a sweet boy, was wantin&#39; to keep in touch with me and his granny, so he got us this computer so we could email or whatever back and forth.  Says he built it hisself.  He&#39;s a mighty clever young fellah, y&#39;know what I mean y&#39;know?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Bell:** I believe I do.  So how did the computer end up being a truck?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. [[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]Burton[[/span]]:**  //(shrugging)//  Hell if I know, Miss Bell!  All I know is I was havin&#39; trouble figurin&#39; the blamed thing out, so Bobby did somethin&#39; to it to make it like that, y&#39;know what I mean y&#39;know?  He, I dunno, downloaded somethin&#39;, I guess?  Then after that, usin&#39; it was just like drivin&#39; my old pickup!  Doin&#39; the emails or that instant messenger thing was just like talkin&#39; on my CB radio, doin&#39; the internet was just like drivin&#39; down to the store.  Easy as pie, y&#39;know what I mean y&#39;know?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Bell:**  Sounds like a very creative solution to your problem.  Why did you end up using it as a truck instead of a computer?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. [[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]Burton[[/span]]:**  Well, sad to say we didn&#39;t end up using it much for the emails after a while.  Then when ol&#39; Bessie[[footnote]]Later identified as Mr. [[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]Burton[[/span]]&#39;s previous vehicle, a white 1997 Ford F-150.[[/footnote]] broke down last year, I figured, hell, instead of usin&#39; this computer //like// a truck, why not use it //as// a truck?  Money&#39;s tight and fixin&#39; trucks is expensive, y&#39;know what I mean y&#39;know?  Well turns out as long as I kept it plugged up overnight, New Bessie worked just fine gettin&#39; from here to there, so it saved on gas too.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Bell:**  You&#39;ve been using it like this for a year?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. [[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]Burton[[/span]]:**  Sure have, and didn&#39;t have no problems with it until I decided to come up to the city.  Not sure exactly what happened, all I know is I put on the cruise control on that long stretch between here and Longend, then a few minutes later all of a sudden I can&#39;t see through the windshield or the rear view mirror[[footnote]]It is conjectured that this was an effect of SCP-5463&#39;s dual monitors turning off due to the energy saver function.  Since Mr. [[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]Burton[[/span]] claims that the trip to Broken Cliff is the first time he had driven the object outside of Longend, MO, he had likely never driven it long enough to have encountered this issue before.[[/footnote]].  Damndest thing, and a little embarrasin&#39; to say I panicked a little and boom!  Ended up in the ditch.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Bell:**  I&#39;m sorry, but you&#39;ve been driving this thing for a year and nobody in Longend noticed anything strange?
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. [[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]Burton[[/span]]:**  Whatcha mean, strange?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Bell:**  Mr. [[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]Burton[[/span]] . . . Dave, you were driving a desk, a chair, and a computer around town.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mr. [[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]Burton[[/span]]:**  Well hell, darlin&#39;.  We&#39;re pretty simple folk out that way.  I don&#39;t reckon any of us know what these new computers can really do anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Afterword:**  After conducting followup interviews with affected citizens of Longend, Site-272 provided repairs for Mr. [[span style=&#34;background-color: black; color: black&#34;]]Burton[[/span]]&#39;s previous vehicle.  He, his wife, and all witnesses were given Class-B amnestics and replacement memories of all uses of SCP-5463 as a truck having been the previous vehicle instead.
