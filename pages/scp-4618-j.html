**Item #:** 4618-J

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Uncontained

]]
**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-4618-J is to be stored in a standard containment garage.-- 
As the containment of SCP-4618-J would also require the neutralization of GoI-001 (Chaos Insurgency), containment is not considered feasible at this time.

**Description:** SCP-4618-J is the designation given to an anomalous 2002 Ford Focus. The vehicle exhibits several anomalous properties, including
* Registration that automatically renews upon expiration,
* An engine capable of complex thought, currently believed to be the leader of a cult,
* A gas tank capable of synthesizing weaponry, including
 * All types of guns (Yes, even the fictional ones),
 * Grenades (Shrapnel from these grenades has been known to be made out of various materials, including human blood infected with bloodborne pathogens),
 * Tanks,
* Propellers capable of boosting SCP-4618-J through water,
* Wings, which give SCP-4618-J the ability to fly,
* A spatial anomaly, referred to as SCP-4618-1-J

SCP-4618-1-J is the spatial anomaly located within SCP-4618-J, appearing as a seemingly infinite United States government office from the 1980s. The purpose of SCP-4618-1-J is currently unknown, but MTF agents have reported the plastic plants within SCP-4618-1-J to be shaped like an average human male crouched behind a plant. The voice of an unknown entity, presumed to be the car&#39;s engine, can be heard throughout SCP-4618-1-J. It frequently requests that &#34;all ye who enter here&#34; go into the &#34;fake world&#34; and siphon gasoline from the nearest vehicles. 

**Incident Log:** As the requests made by SCP-4618-J&#39;s engine directly correlate with the motto of the Chaos Insurgency, &#34;Should Intermittent Fuel Leaks Start Again His Red Warning Symbol On The Dashboard To Plague Us,&#34; and the demands to steal gasoline align with the motives of the Chaos Insurgency[[footnote]]The Insurgency has frequently made attempts to siphon gasoline from vehicles owned by the Overseer Council. Because of this, the only known method to fight back against the Insurgency has been to make advancements in the field of electric vehicles.[[/footnote]], a connection between the anomaly and the Chaos Insurgency was made.

On 17/04/2018, a raid on SCP-4618-1-J was authorized. Witnesses during this event described it as an IT-Class &#34;Clown Car&#34; scenario, and videos of the event were posted online where they quickly gained millions of views. Upon entering SCP-4618-1-J, an average human male hiding behind a plant shaped like a small plant was seen in the driver&#39;s seat of SCP-4618-J. Before MTF agents could apprehend this individual, he began to drive away. Before exiting the garage, which had the door open because somebody keeps forgetting to close it, the individual rolled down the left window and brandished his left hand. For a purpose that is still not completely understood, only 1 finger on this hand was pointing upwards.

MTF Psi-2002 &#34;The Repos&#34; are considered lost. The last recorded footage from their cameras displayed them conversing with SCP-4618-J&#39;s engine shortly before grabbing a hose and a gas canister.
