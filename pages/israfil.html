I don&#39;t know nothin&#39; about it. I just shut the window.

I ain&#39;t kiddin&#39;, neither. I sit and I wait and when the light turns red, I shut the window. Been doin&#39; that for... Hell, I dunno. Long ass time. Couple years for sure. Oh! I //do// know the item number. [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-579 Five-Seven-Nine]. But that&#39;s it. 

I dunno what it is, and I don&#39;t wanna. I just shut the window.

There&#39;s nothing to know. I sit in my cube and I read books and play some games sometimes. Don&#39;t even have to leave for lunch or to rock a piss or nothin&#39;. Heh... I shits where I sits. No joke, they got everyone decked out like that, and it&#39;s pretty cushy. Most of the time nothing happens. I don&#39;t even think I had to shut the window for... Hell, I dunno. Long ass time. Couple of years for sure. Oh! I //do// know the item number. Five-Seven-Nine. But that&#39;s it.

I dunno what it is, and I don&#39;t wanna. I just shut the window.

Been here longer than anyone else I know. Sometimes after shift, they come up to me and say &#34;hey, we&#39;re goin&#39; for a drink, you wanna come.&#34; And I says &#34;sure&#34;, cuz I&#39;m a nice guy like that. We go over to the on-site bar and we have a couple drinks. Everyone talks about family and kids and what they&#39;re doing it for. I ain&#39;t got a family. I tells them they&#39;re all my family and they chuckle. Chuck L.! That&#39;s my name! I say it&#39;s cuz I laugh so much. At games. At TV. At jokes. Jokes are funny. But that thing they got me doin&#39;? That&#39;s not funny. Lucky, I haven&#39;t seen it for... Hell, I dunno. Long ass time. Couple of years for sure. Oh! I //do// know the item number. Five-Seven-Nine. But that&#39;s it.

I dunno what it is... I did once, but I don&#39;t wanna. Not anymore. I just shut the window.

The others? I don&#39;t know. Sometimes they talk about what they do, even though it ain&#39;t right. It&#39;s against the rules. They know that, too. They say &#34;We all got clearance, what&#39;s the harm?&#34; There was a lady named Jaimie who wanted to know that I shut the window. But I didn&#39;t say. It&#39;s okay to tell you, right? I told people... I told people they were sharing. They were telling each other the things they did, and it&#39;s not right. It&#39;s not... You&#39;re not supposed to know what the other person does. It&#39;s against the rules. And they knew that, too! When everyone said what they did, something bad happened. I&#39;m glad I said something when I did or it coulda been //real// bad. It ain&#39;t been that bad for... Hell, I dunno. Long ass time. Couple of years for sure. Oh! I //do// know the item number. Five-Seven-Nine. But that&#39;s it.

I... I knew what it was once, but I don&#39;t wanna. Not anymore. I just shut the window.

I didn&#39;t see Jaimie after that. It&#39;s better this way, though. Some things... Some things I ain&#39;t never gonna forget. No matter how many times I get dosed, no matter how dumb I get. Yeah, I know I ain&#39;t bright. I weren&#39;t never bright. Heh heh heh. Bright, like Dr. Bright! That&#39;s funny. I like to laugh. Like to chuckle. Chuck L.! That&#39;s my name! I say it&#39;s cuz I laugh so much. There&#39;s a lot to laugh about in this world. That&#39;s what I like. I like funny jokes and sunny days. I like to go outside when I&#39;m off and feel the grass on my feet. It reminds me... It reminds me how important it is that I keep doing this. Because of things like... Things like this thing they got me watchin&#39;... Because if I don&#39;t do this, I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t wanna know. I //do// know the item number. SCP-579. But that&#39;s all.

I did know once, but I don&#39;t want to. Not anymore or ever again. I just shut the window.

And I&#39;ve heard other parts of the process. It&#39;s not pretty. A lot of it is very mundane, but there&#39;s this one guy who shuts a door, and behind that door are about 500 people, sometimes more, and most of the time they don&#39;t come back out when it&#39;s over and we get the all-clear. Jesus I&#39;m getting lucid. You said I can&#39;t have any more pills, eh? I&#39;d really like some. I haven&#39;t been this together in... Hell, I dunno. Long ass time. Five years for sure, maybe longer. It&#39;s hard when there are all these patches missing. Oh! I //do// know the item number. SCP-579. But that&#39;s all. That&#39;s all I know about it.

That&#39;s all I know and that&#39;s all I wanna--

...Shit.

Pardon me, but this //is// a restricted area. I&#39;m gonna have to ask you to leave. No, it ain&#39;t strictly required but... Don&#39;t argue, just go. God help you if you don&#39;t. Heh heheheh! HA-HA! God! //That&#39;s// funny. I do like to laugh. &#34;Chuckle&#34; they call me, behind my back when they think I ain&#39;t listenin&#39;. I know our session ain&#39;t over, but that&#39;s okay. You&#39;ll end it yourself in a second when it hits you. ...Yep, there you go. Feel that behind the eyes? Yeah... Too late now. Put that helmet on and don&#39;t take it off until I take it off //for// you. YES it&#39;s important. Trust me. You don&#39;t wanna see it. You don&#39;t wanna know. 

Hell, //I// don&#39;t wanna know, but I know. Been a while since this happened. Loooong ass time. Five years at least, probably more. SCP-579 doesn&#39;t try to break containment often, but when it does...

Nevermind. You don&#39;t have to think about it.

Because I&#39;m here. And I shut the window.</textarea></pre>
