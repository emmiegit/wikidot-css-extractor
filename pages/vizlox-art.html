I decided to make an art page because why not? 

Most of the art here is probably going to be screenshots / clips from an SCP Animation --I&#39;m working on-- that I need to get back to work on at some point. I also work on two SCP games so I may post some art from that if I can. 

Most of the SCP art I have from before I started that animation are really old and look like shit so I will probably just shove that all in a collapsible as a &#34;see how far I&#39;ve come&#34; kind of thing.

+++ SCP Pipedream
This is the animation I mentioned earlier. I haven&#39;t been keeping track but if I had to guess, I&#39;d say I put 50 to 150 hours into it. I think I started this in early 2018 or late 2017, but I only worked on it on-off for awhile before completely abandoning the project for a few months because I got distracted with other projects. I am hoping to finish up some stuff and get back to work on this so I can finish it and get it out the door.

The basic synopsis of the animation is &#34;Security guard goes on a drug trip&#34;. The entertainment is more from the trippy visuals of the animation rather than a story, but I do want to have a story in the background for you to pick up on. Before you ask, no I have never done drugs, other than coffee. 

FYI I am making the animation in ToonBoom, with backgrounds made in Gimp.

Also, I am working on this project by myself, but I want to look into finding voice actors at some point down the line.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Security Guard Person&#34; hide=&#34;Hide&#34;]]
This is (as of now) the very first frame of the animation.

The security guard is heavily inspired by the security from containment breach. I would say the background, specifically the texturing, was inspired by how Lord Bung does his backgrounds.

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-086&#34; hide=&#34;Hide&#34;]]
SCP-086 is in the back there along with some miscellaneous shapes and illusions. This is the planned background for a scene near the end of the animation. (I added a border so it meshed better against the white background.)

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-2146&#34; hide=&#34;Hide&#34;]]
This was in that confinement music special so I thought I would try and make it a trend to have in animations for SCP. Gotta include that 2146 reference.

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-312&#34; hide=&#34;Hide&#34;]]
Lucky you! You get to see some actual //animation!// It a bit low res because I cropped it from a larger scene but this is SCP-312 floating around in space. I think one of the frames may have also gotten removed when I converted it to a gif. It looks slightly choppier than in ToonBoom.

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-Not-A-Real-SCP&#34; hide=&#34;Hide&#34;]]
This isn&#39;t an SCP on the site. It doesn&#39;t have a number. It is an SCP that appears during the first few scenes of the animation. This was a concept art for it, not actually from the animation, which is why it looks a bit pixely.

You could probably guess where the name &#34;Pipe Dream&#34; comes from at this point.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Animation Frame&#34; hide=&#34;Hide&#34;]]
This is a frame from around the middle of the animation. Go ahead and theorize about what is going on here.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Another Animation Frame&#34; hide=&#34;Hide&#34;]]
This is another animation frame from one of the trippier parts of the animation. The background is taken from the Mandelbrot set but I need to get higher quality images for that at some point.

+++ SCP Games

I work in the concept art department for SCP Ascension but I don&#39;t have anything of my own to show here. All of that is under lock and chain.

I also work on a game called SCP Foundation Command which is pretty early in development. I do graphics for it but most of what I&#39;ve done so far is concept / placeholder since we are still very early.

The game is similar to Prison Architect except you build an SCP site facility instead of a prison, so of course there has to be D-Class. Here is a mock-up for a D-Class design.

The plan is to have a wide variety of body and face types so most of them won&#39;t have an ugly ass chin.

+++ Other SCP stuff

Here is an abandoned animation project called &#34;Project Shotgun&#34;. It was going to take place in the Bellerverse but I realized my plans were way too ambitious and unachievable so I abandoned it and reworked a lot of my ideas into Pipe Dream.

There is nothing but a green screen for the second half of the video because I exported the video wrong.

+++ Misc.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Jeffeffe&#34; hide=&#34;Hide&#34;]]
This isn&#39;t an SCP related thing but I am really proud of it and it looks like it could be an SCP so I&#39;m including it on my page.

Also I named it Jeffeffe because I think it&#39;s funny.
