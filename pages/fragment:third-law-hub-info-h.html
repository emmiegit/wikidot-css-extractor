Major characters who appear multiple times throughout the canon, along with their list of appearances. Appearances outside of the canon but within the extended continuity are also included, although only the most significant appearances are listed individually. Extracanonical appearances are marked as follows:

* ⁂ indicates Augmented Canon, articles from one of Third Law&#39;s sister canons that are almost entirely compatible. Unless indicated otherwise, you can assume that everything in these articles is canon for Third Law.
* # indicates Hard Continuity, articles which are largely compatible with Third Law. Unless explicitly contradicted by a Canon article or otherwise indicated, you can assume that these articles are fully canon for Third Law.
* † indicates Soft Continuity, articles which are largely incompatible with Third Law but still exert a strong influence on it. Unless directly referenced by a Canon article or otherwise indicated, you should not assume that these articles are canon within Third Law.

A more thorough overview of the different types of continuity, and the major works in the extended continuity, can be found in the Continuity tab.

[!--
Any character that appears two or more times in the canon can be added to this list by any author that has used them, although not every character that meets these criteria should necessarily be included. When adding characters to this list, use the following format:

|| Full name (not including titles, unless the title is part of their name) || Short, one to two sentence description || Linked list of appearances (linking to any series hubs where applicable to reduce list size) || _

||  ||  ||  || _

Try to keep this list alphabetized by first name (inclusive of titles and articles).
