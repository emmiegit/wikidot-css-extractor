++ A Note on Daevite Linguistics
The study of the languages spoken by the Daevites is very much unique in the field of historical linguistics. Many aspects of Daevite culture, their language included, were seemingly developed completely independently from any other culture known to us. As such, the Old Daevite language is remarkably different from all of its neighbours, and is classified as a linguistic isolate[[footnote]] A language which shares no confirmed connection to any other language, e.g. Basque, Sumerian, and Elamite. [[/footnote]].

Regardless, many historical isolates are known and studied by modern linguistics. The most major difference between Daevite and other languages is the way in which the language evolved over time. Much like other aspects of Daevite culture, their language changed and diverged remarkably little over its long written history[[footnote]] Approximately 3000 years as of the writing of this document.[[/footnote]]. 

Historical Daevite inscriptions are generally divided, somewhat arbitrarily, into the following four languages:

|| **Old Daevite** || Includes the earliest Daevite materials available to us, _
and all inscriptions until the destruction and annexation _
of the neighbouring Sarkic state at approximately 1000 BCE. ||
|| **Middle Daevite** || Includes Daevite materials written after 1000 BCE and before _
the fracturing of the Daevite state at approximately 200 CE. ||
|| **Late Daevite** || Includes Daevite inscriptions dating after 200 CE and before _
the end of Daevite independence at approximately 1300 CE. ||
|| **Neo-Daevite** || Includes Daevite-language materials produced after the end _
of Daevite independence by remaining native speaker groups. ||

This document aims to constitute a modern introduction to the Old Daevite language specifically, which is of particular interest to the Foundation due to the many records written in it discussing early Sarkicism and the Xia Anomalous Culture Group. 

++ Phonology
Due to the fact Old Daevite is an extinct language, its exact pronunciation remains unknown. However, a theoretical realization of the following phonemes has been inferred from transliterations of Daevite words into neighbouring languages.

+++ Vowels

|| || **Front** || **Back** ||
|| **Close** || i /i/ || u /u/ ||
|| **Mid** || e /e/ || o /o/ ||
|| **Open** || a /a/ || á /ɒ/ ||

The following diphthongs[[footnote]] Glides from one vowel to another. [[/footnote]] are attested:

|| || **Initial a** || **Initial e** || **Initial i** ||
|| **Final u** || au /a͡u/ || eu /e͡u/ || ||
|| **Final o** || ao /a͡o/ || || io /i͡o/ ||
|| **Final á** || || eá /e͡ɒ/ || iá /i͡ɒ/ ||
|| **Final e** || ae /a͡e/ || || ||
|| **Final i** || ai /a͡i/ || || ||

+++ Consonants

|| || **Labial** || **Alveolar** || **Post-Alveolar** || **Velar** || **Pharyngeal** ||
|| **Nasal** || m /m/ |||| n /n/ || || ||
|| **Stop** || p /p/ b /b/ |||| t /t/ d /d/ || k /k/ g /g/ || ||
|| **Ejective Stop** || |||| ṭ /tʼ/ || ḳ /kʼ/ || ||
|| **Fricative** || f /ɸ/ || s /s/ z /z/ || š /ʃ/ || x /x/ || h /ħ/ ||
|| **Approximant** || v /ʋ/ |||| r /ɹ/ || || ||
|| **Lateral** || |||| l /l/ || || ||

+++ Phonotactics

The following phonotactical rules apply in Old Daevite:
* The maximum syllable is CVCC. 
* Gemination[[footnote]] Pronunciation of a consonant for longer than normal. In Old Daevite, roughly twice as long. [[/footnote]] is only allowed for nasals and stops. 
* Ejective consonants are not allowed in consonant clusters. If a consonant clusters with an ejective, the consonant is deleted.
* Voiceless non-ejective stops become aspirated when at the end of a word.

++ Grammar

+++ Grammatical Gender

Quite unusually for a language of Siberia, Old Daevite possessed a thorough grammatical gender (or noun-class) system. This system affected pluralization as well as verb conjugation. When referring to groups containing multiple genders, a hierarchy was employed to determine which gender to use for the whole. The group was always referred to using the &#34;highest&#34; gender contained by it. The genders of the Daevite system are as follows, from highest to lowest in the hierarchy:

|| **Leading / Open-Form** || **Conceptual / Coda-Form** || **Animate / A-Form** || **Inanimate / B-Form** ||
|| Mostly used for rulers, leaders, driving forces in the material world, and occasionally other nouns when they are the subject of a sentence. These nouns usually, though not always, include an open vowel (á or a) in their final syllable. || Used for ideas, religious concepts, numbers, and other such things which cannot be physically interacted with. A large amount of these nouns end with nasals or stops. || Used for physical objects which are alive to some degree, such as humans, animals, and plants. These nouns rarely have unifying features that distinguish them from nouns with other genders. || Used for physical objects which are not alive, such as rocks, tools, and various materials. These nouns rarely have unifying features that distinguish them from nouns with other genders. ||
|| Examples: _
Potniá &#34;Slave-Owner&#34; _
Urdal &#34;King&#34; || Examples: _
Tivik &#34;One&#34; _
Heug &#34;Spirit&#34; || Examples: _
Leux &#34;Child&#34; _
Hiz &#34;Tree&#34; || Examples: _
Hiázai &#34;Tongue&#34;[[footnote]] Root of Hiázaifeut, literally &#34;Our Tongue&#34;, which the Daevites used to refer to their own language. [[/footnote]] _
Šeg &#34;Rock&#34; ||

  

+++ Noun and adjective declension

Old Daevite possessed three grammatical numbers - a singular, a plural, and, interestingly, a null or &#34;zero&#34; number not found in any other language of the region. As an example:

|| **Singular** || **Plural** || **Null** ||
|| Ḳast || Ḳastau || Mazḳast ||
|| &#34;One fruit&#34; || &#34;Many fruits&#34; || &#34;No fruits&#34; ||

The singular number is always unmarked. However, nouns in the plural and null numbers are marked with an affix that denotes their number and gender, as is any adjective referring to them. These declensions are as follows:

|| || **Leading** || **Conceptual** || **Animate** || **Inanimate** ||
|| Singular || || || || ||
|| Plural || -(t)[[footnote]] The t is inserted only if the affix is being added after a vowel. [[/footnote]]a || -(t)in || -(t)en || (t)au ||
|| Null |||||||||| maz- ||

Possession is, in turn, managed by a completely separate set of suffixes which are marked on the possessee and change according to the gender and person of the possessor. If a plural noun is the possessee, these suffixes are added following the plural suffix.

|| || 1st Person || 2nd Person || 3rd Person ||
|| Singular || -fai || -lok || -sae ||
|| Plural || -feut || -láket || -saed ||
|| Null |||||| -šu ||

In addition, there existed a simple adjectivizer prefix, á-, which may be used to transform any noun into an adjective. In case of the noun being adjectivized having adjectives itself, those adjectives are also marked with the prefix. For example:

|| **Noun** || **Adjective** ||
|| Kaes &#34;mountain&#34; || Ákaes &#34;mountainous&#34; ||
|| Disat &#34;three&#34; || Ádisat &#34;third&#34; ||

+++ Diminutives

A rarely-attested system of diminutification existed in Old Daevite. From the few occurrences that exist of it, it seems to have operated by the reduplication of the last vowel and the last consonant in the root. This diminutive form could then be used either derogatorily (as in &#34;urdalal&#34;, &#34;little king&#34;, attested as a mocking title for an unknown foreign ruler) or endearingly (as in &#34;xaofaof&#34;, &#34;little flower&#34;, attested as a nickname of a mother to her daughter).

+++ Stop Mutation

Old Daevite included a unique system of stop mutation, based on the relative social standing of the speaker and the listener. This system was not considered to be simple allophony, but rather a core and grammatical part of the language, as is evidenced by these mutations being reflected in the Daevite writing system. 

Daevite stop mutation involved shifting all stops in speech to a differet set if the listener was of significantly higher or lower social rank. These two sets being referred to as the High Register and the Low Register respectively, and are contrasted by the neutral Base Register.

|| **Base Register** || **High Register** || **Low Register** ||
|| b || p || b ||
|| d || t || d ||
|| g || k || g ||
|| p || p || b ||
|| t || ṭ || d ||
|| k || ḳ || g ||
|| ṭ || ṭ || t ||
|| ḳ || ḳ || k ||

As an example, the sentence &#34;the king closed the door&#34;:

&gt; Hios satoku urdal

Would be realized in the High Register as:

&gt; Hios saṭoḳu urtal

And in the Low Register as:

&gt; Hios sadogu urdal

+++ Verb Conjugation

Verb conjugation in Old Daevite was somewhat complex, with each verb having 50 unique forms based on its number, tense, person, and gender. 

The two tenses of Old Daevite were the Future and the Non-Future. The Non-Future was unmarked, while the Future was marked in the Animate, Conceptual, and Leading genders by the suffix -ge. In the Inanimate, this changed to -ke.

The Null number was marked, in both tenses, by the prefix maz-. No person or gender information was encoded in this number.

The person of the verb was encoded using the first consonant of a prefix attached to the verb. For the 1st Person, this consonant was a t, while for the 2nd and 3rd Persons, it was a x and a s respectively.

The vowel of this prefix was determined by both the person and the number of the verb. For the 1st and 2nd Persons, the vowel was i in the Singular and u in the Plural. For the 3rd Person, this vowel was a in the Singular and á in the Plural.

Finally, gender was encoded a few different ways. In the Animate, this was by not attaching any prefix in the Singular 1st Person, and attaching unmarked prefixes in the other conjugations. In the Inanimate, unmarked prefixes are added, and the first consonant of the base verb is geminated if possible.

In the Conceptual, a r is added to the end of the prefix. For verbs in the Leading gender, prefixes are unmarked, while the first vowel of the base verb undergoes a process of mutation wherein it is replaced by a more open vowel. As a and á are completely open vowels, they are unaffected, as are any diphthongs.

|| **Base Vowel** || **Replaced With** ||
|| i || e ||
|| u || o ||
|| e || a ||
|| o || á ||
|| a || a ||
|| á || á ||

+++ Syntax

The general order of sentences and verb phrases in Old Daevite was Object-Verb-Subject. Adjectives were always placed before the nouns they refer to. Somewhat due to the complete lack of any noun cases, this word order was extremely rigid, and materials deviating from it are rare and tend to be much shorter works produced by the lower classes.

It is notable that whenever one is talking of a noun belonging to the Leading gender, it was considered disrespectful to place it in any position in the sentence bar the Subject, in order to maintain their agency. This is reflected in how the Daevites describe both Leading-gender persons or forces they approve of, and those they disapprove of.

Old Daevite completely lacked any form of copula[[footnote]] The &#34;to be&#34; verb of English. [[/footnote]]. In order to state equivalence between two nouns, a speaker simply placed one as the object and one as the subject of the sentence. As this carries no tense information, any change of this relationship over time must be specified using an additional sentence.

Old Daevite employed postpositions. Positional phrases were generally placed before their subject, much like adjectives.

++ Vocabulary

+++ Pronouns

|| || **Leading** || **Conceptual** || **Animate** || **Inanimate** ||
||1st Person Singular || tai || nau || tau || ||
|| 2nd Person Singular || ṭaḳá || namḳa || tuza || ||
|| 3rd Person Singular || tintau || naxiá || taniá || surau ||
|| 1st Person Plural || taiai || xunau || xutá || ||
|| 2nd Person Plural || ḳuṭa || xunma || xuxe || ||
|| 3rd Person Plural || tixtiá || naxau || taosa || suxrau ||
|| Null |||||||| mazšu ||

The Null pronoun was primarily used to refer to the nouns the speaker was unaware of. This was particularly useful for forming questions, although the restrictive nature of the pronoun meant Old Daevite questions only accepted nouns as answers, and questions were always phrased appropriately for that restriction. As an example:

&gt; Mazšu xinuxe tuza?

&gt; What did you eat?[[footnote]] More literally: &#34;You ate null?&#34;. [[/footnote]]

Demonstrative pronouns[[footnote]] English &#34;that&#34;, &#34;this&#34;, &#34;those&#34;, etc. [[/footnote]] were formed by adding a demonstrative suffix, -ne, to the end of any existing pronoun.

++ The Writing System

The writing system of Old Daevite was an abugida[[footnote]] A system in which consonants and vowels are written as a unit, with vowel notation being secondary. E.g. Ethiopic script, Brahmic script.[[/footnote]], written top to bottom, left to right. This is due to the script originally developing as a method of writing on trees, although due to their organic nature, few inscriptions in this medium are available for modern study.

+++ Consonant Notation

Consonants are marked in a downwards line within each word. Words are then separated by a designated word separator. 

|| Word Separator || [[image WordSeparator.png]] ||

A list of the different consonant letters is available below, next to their romanization.

[[=image ConsonantTable.png]]

+++ Vowel Notation

Vowels were marked using three different symbols, each corresponding to a degree of vowel openness, which could be placed on either side of the consonant line based on frontness. This featural system provided an easy way to mark all 6 base vowels of Old Daevite.

[[=image VowelTable.png]]

In case of a word beginning with a vowel, vowel markings were placed on the word separator that preceded it. 

Finally, in order to mark diphthongs, two vowel marks were graphically joined to each other. This was done without significant modification when the two marks are on the same side of the consonantal line. However, when they were on opposite sides, a horizontal connector extended between them.

If the following consonant was a coda of the syllable, then the second vowel mark took the place normally taken by the vowel of an onset consonant. In case of the following consonant being an onset of a separate syllable, it is pushed downwards.

++ Numeral System
Daevite reverence of prime numbers, particularly seven, extended into the numeral system used in their language. While it is the opinion of most researchers in the field that the system described here was not the one used by the majority of the Empire&#39;s population[[footnote]] This view is based on the system&#39;s unfeasible complexity, as well as multiple basic numeration mistakes found in lower-class works that hint at writers being not completely familiar with the system. [[/footnote]], it was likely the system used in documentation and high-class speech, and hence is the only Old Daevite numeral system a record of which still exists.

The Old Daevite numeral system was capable of describing any natural number except 1, and was based on prime factorization[[footnote]] The process by which any composite number may be described as the product of a unique set of prime numbers. [[/footnote]]. This makes the Daevites the earliest known discoverers of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, preceding Euclid&#39;s //Elements// by at least 1,300 years.

As there is an infinite amount of prime numbers, a subsystem existed within Old Daevite in order to describe the position of a prime within the list of prime numbers. This subsystem was heptimal[[footnote]] Base 7. [[/footnote]], although 4 and 6 were represented using their prime factors rather than unique digits, and the last number was always a digit, rather than any heptimal number. The general Old Daevite numerical system used 7 digits to represent the first 7 prime numbers, with the rest being formed using the heptimal subsystem. Prime numbers not within the first 7 are distinguished by being written left-to-right, rather than up-to-down like the rest of Daevite writing.

The Daevites likely did not consider 1 to be a number - while a word for it did exist, there existed no digit with its value. Rather, on the rare occasions where 1 is used in surviving Daevite mathematics, the word is spelled out using the usual orthography rather than being represented numerically.

A list of Daevite digits is provided below.

[[=image DaeviteNumerals.png]]

The following are examples of various attested numbers written using the system. Note: due to numbers being expressed through multiplication of prime factors, the order in which the digits are written up-to-down is meaningless[[footnote]] Despite this, there existed a general trend of writing the factors in increasing order, with the top being the smallest and the bottom being the largest. [[/footnote]]. Order matters only where prime numbers are written using the heptimal subsystem. 

|| **Number (Arabic numerals)** || **Number (Daevite numerals)** || **Daevite pronunciation** || **Literal translation** ||
|| 55 || [[=image 55.png]] || Lok kafšan kut || Five with eleven ||
|| 141 || [[=image 141.png]] || Tu átu mán kut || Three with third two ||
