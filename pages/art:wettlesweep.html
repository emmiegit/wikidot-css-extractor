+ 0. The Original
[[*user HarryBlank]] made this image to advertise his 7k.

And then he never did.

So I took on the burden.

I have collected the 35 tweets and associated images and text I made over the course of the 7k voting period and presented them here for your viewing &#34;pleasure&#34;.

[[=image https://i.imgur.com/JDLmCYW.jpg]]

+ 1. The Shallow Fry
&gt; @HarryBlankSCP #scp #SCPFoundation #scp7kcontest #onguard43
I started the process with a simple shallow fry with some glowing red wettle eyes on the side. I added some text in a childish font, some very basic conspiratorial thinking: 43 decomposes to 4 + 3, which adds to 7, which means 7k hashtag wettlesweep. I saved the JPEG with 30% to 40% compression. After all, I had 30 or more days of this.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/Rfy7vHq.jpg]]

+ 2. The Deep Fry
For day 2, I said nothing, but saved the image at 10% compression. 
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/7Cm5G7W.jpg]]

+ 3. Eyes of the Loser
&gt; every day i make it worse
I had already added red Wettle eyes, but they had lost definition in the compression.

So I added more.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/s69fdPU.jpg]]

+ 4. Crown of Chaos: teh loser
&gt; tehre is no escape.

I honestly don&#39;t know why the face got better. Maybe I worked off of the wrong one. Not a mistake I made again.

I added a star shaped thingy above his head as a crown of sorts.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/eIbS1bB.jpg]]

+ 5. The Fried Crown
&gt; day... 5? I&#39;m losing track.

This was not the first time time became meaningless during 7k. It would not be the last.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/47Yh9QW.jpg]]

+ 6. O Canada
&gt; teh loser day 6
&gt; i added something to emphasize the canadian setting

And what is more Canadian than a creative commons Maple Leaf SVG?
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/8aFXqeo.jpg]]

+ 7. Deep Fried Maple Syrup
&gt; day 6 for realsies this time
&gt; making it worse, makin it worse
It was not, in fact, day 6.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/OCVKToD.jpg]]

+ 8. Moose!
&gt; it has come to my attention that it may not have been canadian enough. Here, have a moose.
I think the caption here is self explanatory. Yet GIMP&#39;s select by color tool is quite fickle, and so I was only able to partially remove the forest background of my moose picture.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/ppexclW.jpg]]

+ 9. Beavers!
&gt; the people get what the people want
[[*user bigslothonmyface]] suggested I add some beavers, so I did.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/cmNzYRB.jpg]]

+ 10. By Grufugoi 
&gt; i realized that in my efforts to make the hype posters for my favorite 7k entry, the loser, more Canadian, i had forgotten some very important information like name and title
&gt; I have rectified that.
There is a running joke where people confuse Harry Blank and Grigori Karpin. Grigori doesn&#39;t actually like it when you anglophonize his username though. Sorry Grigori. I needed to stretch out the joke.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/W0344Up.jpg]]

+ 11. I mean By [[*user Grigori Karpin]]
&gt; pselled it wrong
This is the second part of the already stretched out joke, in which I spell Grigori&#39;s name right.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/yxGerL0.jpg]]

+ 12. By the loser, Harry Blank
&gt; god i keep messing up the basics
After 3 days of trying, I finally put the author on the thing correctly.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/iLAN1wc.jpg]]

+ 13. Commas are important, kids.
&gt; this marks the 13th edit i&#39;ve made i think
&gt; 13 indeed?
In this one, I crossed out the comma after &#34;The loser&#34; because it does in fact imply that Harry is the loser. This is not the case. Ignore the fact that I added the picture of Dr. Harry Blank from SCP-7000 below. Ignore it.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/GJyQ1HL.jpg]]

+ 14. Pixels.
This was a lazy one. I just pixeled it.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/G5WYf8A.jpg]]

+ 15. Lens Flair
&gt; it was starting to look too pixely so i tried fixing it with a blur
At this point, I decided to feign caring about aesthetics, which really opened up a lot of possibilities
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/qBzfpfL.jpg]]

+ 16. This Loser Not That One
&gt; the captions were in the way so I felt like clarifying further
Using a tool to add text ultimately ends up being rather neat and clean, compared to drawing it haphazardly with your mouse. I decided to add Wettle back in with more clarity and to clarify that Wettle, not Dr. Blank, was The Loser.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/TQdYqDa.jpg]]

+ 17. Blending In
&gt; day 16 8/11/2022: did some modifications for visual consistency

I blurred Wettle so it was just his face. I didn&#39;t give any care to the rest of the picture.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/eOWucbS.jpg]]

+ 18. Intermitted Vengeance
&gt; by the way, the chaos insurgency is in this one. Harry Blank doesn&#39;t advertise it with that fact, but it is.
&gt; though to be fair this is because harry hasn&#39;t advertised this at all
I gave Wettle a clown collar that was the Chaos Insurgency logo.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/seIZXN0.jpg]]

+ 19. Red Right Dot
&gt; here comes the sun doo doo doo doo
&gt; 
&gt; wettlefacts: 
&gt; 1) the red light thingy is part of the proper chaos insurgency logo and the chaos insurgency is in this one
&gt; 2) it also looks like a clown nose and wettle is a clown
&gt; 
&gt; this is your daily dose of wettlefacts
To go with the collar I gave him a clown nose. I also plugged my own 7k, [[[SCP-7997]]], in the replies. It didn&#39;t really help.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/9RvAEXI.jpg]]

+ 20. Bringing Beaver Back
&gt; it was no longer obvious this was canadian so I added a beaver pic back in
&#34;Beaver&#34; can be slang for vagina.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/XsQUAy1.jpg]]

+ 21. More Pixels More Censorship
&gt; lets play spot the difference
got lazy, just blurred it.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/lTZrex2.jpg]]

+ 22. The Prettiest Wettle&#39;s Ever Been
&gt; i think wettle looks better this way
Saved at 10% compression
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/aAxnWyJ.jpg]]

+ 23. The Rainbow Is Not A Social Commentary
&gt; in order to emphasize how &#34;political&#34; (i.e. &#34;Canadian&#34;) i have added the author&#39;s name in rain8ow (sorry b key 8broke)
My b key really was broken, but I set up a macro to type it anyways. Replaced my keyboard though!

The comment was in no way a commentary and is just a reference to how the OG43 logo is a picture of Canadian geography which is political because of uh the colonization history.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/Rbg6xwl.jpg]]

+ 24. Remember, this is Canadian!
&gt; genuinely surprising no one has called me out on how lazy my depictions of canadianiness are
I was honestly too lazy to try to pull the maple leaf pic again and it didn&#39;t feel right either.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/ffgIyAm.jpg]]

+ 25. Moose are Canadian, right?
&gt; i&#39;ve only seen a moose in the wild once
&gt; it was off the road around 30 feet
&gt; there were a whole bunch of tourists looking at it and taking pictures
&gt; or maybe the road was empty and it was sunset
&gt; i don&#39;t recall it was many moons ago
&gt; how many?
&gt; who knows
Comment based on a true story.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/lgtByZK.jpg]]

+ 26. It has come to my attention that my understanding of Canada is superficial.
&gt; putting a little more effort into the canadianness , just a little
And what could be more Canadian than healthcare?
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/RQZyc53.jpg]]

+ 27. Now Presenting the Time After Time Password
&gt; did you know william wettle appears in the tale series &#34;the time after time password&#34; by [[*user HarryBlank]]
&gt; 
&gt; weird right
Art is from that tale series.

Harry didn&#39;t believe that tale series got tags anymore.

I proved him wrong. #time-after-time-password
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/oYdzZuj.jpg]]

+ 28. Looking Sharp
&gt; wettle looking &#34;sharp&#34;ened
I just used the sharpening tool and the blur tool in various measures. 
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/ubBAN75.jpg]]

+ 29. A Pretty Watercolor
&gt; everyone seems &#34;burned out&#34; by 7kcon so I decided to apply a &#34;water color&#34; filter to the meme i think that is uspposed to help?
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/1R2AHrG.jpg]]

+ 30. Abstraction
&gt; this &#34;filters&#34; things is real cool, it&#39;s like a replacement for actual artistic ability! (not a commentary on current happenings on the scp wiki) 
This was probably a commentary on a current happening on the SCP Wiki.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/jwPINYZ.jpg]]

+ 31. Oops Maple Syrup Spill
&gt; oops accidentally dropped some maple syrup on my dank meme.
Whoops.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/NVgsnzU.jpg]]

+ 32. Starting from the Beginning
&gt; sometimes you fuck up so badly it&#39;s easier to start from the beginning
I tried undoing the maple syrup spill via filters but it didn&#39;t work so instead I put in a Wettle drawing and some basic descriptions.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/J36aUnz.jpg]]

+ 33. Bringing Everything Back
&gt; BRINGING EVCERYTHING BACK
Something had been lost, something essential. So I recreated everything from all the pictures I had lying around.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/sFYU9h5.jpg]]

+ 34. Dawn of a New Day
&gt; A GLORIOUS NEW DAY DAWNS ON CANADA!!! #ONGUARD43
There was one day left until results were announced.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/qCx7mxm.jpg]]

+ 35. SCP-7000
&gt; #WETTLESWEEP
&gt; #WETTLESWEEP
&gt; #WETTLESWEEP
And it was official.
[[=image https://i.imgur.com/NVGZbBB.jpg]]

+ #ONGUARD43VER
