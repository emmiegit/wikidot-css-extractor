++++ Act 1
++ Trashcan&#39;s Eleven 

&#34;You really think working a desk in the bullpen beats being out here in the field?&#34; Agent Rodney asked between bites of his cheeseburger.

&#34;Hot pot of coffee always on, my nice ergonomic office chair, a bathroom right there whenever I want it... Gosh, what&#39;s to miss, right?&#34; Agent Polk warily eyed the parking lot of the drive-thru joint while they each dug into their combo meals.

&#34;Meeting new anomalies, saving people from monsters, getting exercise - you can&#39;t get that wasting away on a desk.&#34;

&#34;Exactly my point,&#34; Polk said while brushing the crumbs from his lap. &#34;At least on a desk I don&#39;t have to worry about my computer trying to kill me or something. Sometimes I feel like we&#39;re just a step above D-Class.&#34;

&#34;I don&#39;t see it that way,&#34; Rodney lapped some sauce from the corner of his mouth. &#34;Few actually have the opportunity we have.&#34;

&#34;So you think it&#39;s an honor?&#34;

&#34;Well, that&#39;s part of the deal, but no.&#34; Rodney squinted in thought, then looked his partner in the eye. &#34;Life&#39;s not about comfort, if that&#39;s true we&#39;d be all blobs of flesh wasting away on a couch. To me, it&#39;s the moment. Seeing the supernatural up close tends to give you perspective. I mean, we&#39;re going to run out of road eventually, why not make the trip worthwhile?&#34;

Polk didn&#39;t even humor the idea. &#34;Whatever floats your boat, Rod. And it&#39;s &#39;anomalous&#39;, not &#39;supernatural&#39;.&#34;

&#34;Tomato, tomahto.&#34;

The radio on the dashboard crackled alive. &#34;108, Unit 108 - do you copy? Over.&#34;

Rodney snatched up the mic and answered. &#34;Ya, go ahead for 108.&#34;

&#34;What&#39;s your status; are you working something right now?&#34;

&#34;Just trying to get some dinner in.&#34;

Agent Polk stared at Rodney. &#34;I thought this was just a snack until we could get real dinner?&#34;

&#34;I got something on the line here needs a follow-up,&#34; said the dispatcher. &#34;Looks like you&#39;re closest unit to the scene.&#34;

Agent Rodney chuckled to Polk &#34;You can eat once you&#39;re off duty; that&#39;s field work.&#34; Into the mic now, &#34;Dispatch, what do you got?&#34;

&#34;Something from the bunch in, uhh - Online Activities. Some kinda suspicious social media livecasts.&#34;

&#34;Yeah, send it over.&#34;

Just a few seconds later, their mobile monitor indicated an incoming message from HQ. Rodney scrolled past the brief text paragraph and opened up the attachment file; a short video clip began to play. In it he saw a teenage girl, recording herself with her phone and speaking to the camera.

&#34;Guys, this garbage strike is really just too much. I&#39;m standing here on 10th street downtown, and there is //sooo// much trash everywhere! It&#39;s like people can hardly even get around because of how much it&#39;s piled up on the sidewalks.&#34;

Rodney found it uncanny how expertly she framed the scene over her shoulder without looking back - indeed, there were trash bags piled up around already-overflowing wastebins all along the street.

&#34;We&#39;re all in this together, you guys! Please followers, if you can: share this with your friends, and come down to help keep our neighborhood from being totally buried in garbage!&#34;

Agent Rodney grunted, &#34;Kids these days. I never know what to expect from &#39;em.&#34;

&#34;Um, what?&#34; Agent Polk had been watching the same video clip, with the exception that he could plainly see it starred a wheeled rubbish bin which was able to move and talk on its own.

&#34;My memetic immunizations aren&#39;t current,&#34; Rodney explained away the awkward moment when Polk pointed out the reality of the clip.

&#34;And they let you in the field like that?&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s not that big a deal. I&#39;ve got an appointment with a specialist at Site-17 next week.&#34;

&#34;&#39;Not a big deal&#39; he says,&#34; Polk shook his head. &#34;When we&#39;re about to go wading into,&#34; he pointed at the screen, &#34;whatever this is? Because there is //something// up there, right?&#34;

&#34;Yeah, we better get down to 10th and see what&#39;s going on. Why don&#39;t you be a dear and read the rest of the attachments in the meantime?&#34; With a flick of his wrist, Agent Rodney started the engine.

-----

Light traffic and green lights all the way made it a quick drive into the neighborhood.

&#34;So, Online&#39;s doing their thing - stopping the spread and erasing what&#39;s out there,&#34; Polk summarized the rest of the brief on the way. &#34;It&#39;s pervasive, but limited to local groups and feeds here in the city. So at least these videos ain&#39;t getting spread too far.&#34;

&#34;They are effective though,&#34; Rodney slowed to a crawl past the scene on the sidewalk. In an open plaza between office and apartment buildings, small groups of people were milling around and chatting amongst themselves. &#34;Well, it&#39;s nice to see there are still people willing to volunteer here in the city.&#34;

&#34;Nah, come on. It&#39;s making people see a cute girl instead of a trashcan; it&#39;s probably just got some kinda compulsion effect to it too.&#34;

&#34;You&#39;re so cynical.&#34; Rodney found a place to park on the curb. &#34;Come on, let&#39;s talk to a few and find out.&#34;

As they stepped out of the car, each man took a moment to stretch and assess the scene. The crowd was gradually beginning to disperse, their work apparently done. They picked out a group of three young men who were lingering next to a bench; one of them still had coveralls and gloves on.

Approaching, Polk addressed the group. &#34;Hey there fellas. We out here for the community service?&#34;

The three youths all paused and stared mutely at the agents. Probably assessing whether we&#39;re a couple of cops, thought Rodney. &#34;Hi there,&#34; he stepped forward, deciding to take the lead. &#34;Doug Randall. I&#39;m a reporter with the Bugle,&#34; the agent grinned and extended his hand. &#34;I&#39;d just like to talk, if you guys have a moment to spare.&#34;

The group exchanged looks, but finally the one in coveralls spoke up. &#34;Talk about what?&#34;

&#34;Well, it&#39;s uhh... it&#39;s for a human interest piece,&#34; Rodney improvised. &#34;We&#39;ve been in touch with local volunteer organizations, trying to learn a bit about the members and their experiences.&#34;

&#34;Oh, we aren&#39;t members of any organization,&#34; the tallest of the three youths admitted.

&#34;No?&#34; Polk interrupted. &#34;So how did all these people come down here at the same time?&#34;

&#34;Well,&#34; Coveralls glanced between his friends as he explained. &#34;I guess because of the video. Right?&#34;

&#34;What video&#39;s that?&#34;

&#34;Online, man! This chick was linking it all over, it came up in my feeds like a hundred times today. But then again I suppose I get it, kinda.&#34;

&#34;What do you mean?&#34;

&#34;Like... Okay, so I guess lots of old folks live in some of these apartments?&#34; Coveralls explained. &#34;The chick was saying how her grandma does, and now because of the garbage strike there&#39;s so much trash around on all the sidewalks that she can&#39;t even walk to get groceries or whatever.&#34; With a shrug, he added &#34;so that sucks.&#34;

&#34;But where did you people actually take all the trash?&#34;

&#34;We didn&#39;t! We just pushed it all over to the curb, so there would be a big wide pathway on the sidewalk.&#34;

The agents scanned the surrounding area, but none of the accumulated garbage remained. Exchanging nods, Rodney and Polk decided to end the interview there and get back in the car.

&#34;So hey! Are we, like, gonna get our pictures in the paper or what?&#34;

&#34;Oh, we just might have an even bigger scoop to cover,&#34; Rodney called back over his shoulder. &#34;Thanks for your time, gents!&#34; Tossing the car keys to his partner now, &#34;Here, drive us around the block a little.&#34;

Polk accelerated away from the curb. &#34;Okay, so what are you thinking?&#34;

&#34;These folks there can&#39;t have finished very long ago, so that trash must have been scooped up recently,&#34; Rodney kept his eyes focused out his side window. &#34;Here, let&#39;s take a look down that way.&#34;

Finally they see it, like a line drawn at the mouth of an alleyway - on one side the streets are clean, while on the other trash bags are stacked pressed together neatly. On Rodney&#39;s order, Polk pulled over and the Agents got out on foot. A scan down the alley revealed nothing of note, so Polk and Rodney continued along the sidewalk toward the intersection.

Rounding the storefront in the building on the corner, they saw a flatbed cargo truck idling at the curb; piled high on the deck were loads of garbage.

&#34;Excuse me, sir,&#34; Rodney stepped forward and called out to the driver. &#34;Sir, can you turn that engine off for a minute?&#34;

&#34;Are you talking to the dummy?&#34; Polk turned to Rodney quizzically.

&#34;Don&#39;t insult the guy, I&#39;m trying to get us close.&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s literally a mannequin propped up in the seat,&#34; Polk said. &#34;You don&#39;t see that?&#34;

Rodney looked again, squinting. &#34;Oh... Well okay then, let&#39;s go take a look.&#34; But as they approached the truck, it suddenly cranked into gear and the engine revved. &#34;I thought you said that wasn&#39;t a real person driving it!&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s not!&#34;

&#34;How would a vehicle just drive away on its own-&#34;

Together they exclaimed &#34;Oh no!&#34;

Turning around and sprinting back to their car in order to give pursuit, the Agents came upon a sight even more displeasing: their vehicle had been rolled over onto its roof in the middle of the sidewalk. A forklift pivoted and sped away from the scene.

Two gunshots rang out. The mannequin in the forklift seat bucked against its restraints as pieces of its head were scattered by a bullet. A stunned Polk turned toward Agent Rodney, who stood with his smoking gun drawn. &#34;Why did you shoot the dummy?!&#34;

Rodney gave Polk a blank look. The forklift, unaffected by the shots, disappeared around a corner.

&#34;You knew that one was a dummy, right?&#34; Polk asked.

&#34;Yes,&#34; replied Rodney. Following a skeptical beat from Polk he restated emphatically, &#34;Yes! That was a warning shot.&#34; They were interrupted by a sudden shout from behind.

&#34;Freeze! Drop your weapon!&#34;

Both Agents groaned; they should have known if a police officer were in the vicinity. But as they turned around they heard three letters that explained everything.

&#34;FBI! I said drop it!&#34;

Foundation MTF Agents Polk and Rodney turned to bear the Foundation sigil markers of their uniforms; they stood facing the guns and badges of two UIU Field Agents in the street. All four men had the exact same thought:

&#34;Ah, crap.&#34;
