**Item #:** SCP-4808

* 100% are mildly allergic to dogs.

**Addendum:** Incident Report

PoI-3281 [[footnote]]Legal name ████████ ████, had a known history of failed businesses, early employment terminations, and in one case, an attempted connection with GoI-9272 (&#34;Potz Blitz&#34;). Lack of employment often cited as a &#34;lack of motivation&#34;[[/footnote]] was found dead in their home due to self-termination by hanging. An instance of SCP-4808-1 appeared; however, its throat was slit and the specimen was dead. Investigation of PoI-3281&#39;s apartment found several other suicide implements, all broken. PoI-3281&#39;s suicide note is as follows:

&gt; It&#39;s all a joke, just a long, unfulfilling joke. The punchline isn&#39;t worth it. No matter what, it never will be. Why not just cut it short?
&gt; 
&gt; If my entire life is a joke, it&#39;s not even a good one.
