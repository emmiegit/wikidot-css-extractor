You are entirely responsible for ensuring your subordinates are covered by insurance policies they do not have the clearance to know about, on top of their physical safety.

If you **anticipate** that you **or your subordinates** will pursue avenues of research likely to create risks not covered by SCP-6987, contact the Legal Department to arrange for expanded coverage.

Report any unsolicited communications purporting to be from Goldbaker-Reinz to the Legal Department.

Congratulations on your promotion to Level 4.

You understand what Securing, Containing, and Protecting truly entails. Sometimes, for the greater good, we commit a lesser evil. Goldbaker-Reinz helps us out when that evil doesn&#39;t pay off.



Good luck. We understand how hard this can be.

+++ Further Declassifications from Master Agreement SCP-6987-0:
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
++++ Clause 3: Intellectual Property

+++++ INTERNAL NOTICE: DO NOT DISSEMINATE
Both parties are currently believed to be in violation of Clause 3. 

It is believed that Goldbaker-Reinz has knowledge of [[[SCP-2000]]] due to its insistence upon the inclusion of Clause 109.12, &#34;Renegotiation After Reconstruction of History&#34;. 

The Foundation, similarly, is aware of **{{##red|[DATA EXPUNGED TO AVOID LIABILITY IN CASE OF DATA LEAK]##}}**.
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
++++ Clause 5: High-Importance Individuals
Examples of such individuals are Site Directors or members of Overwatch Council. Goldbaker-Reinz is to be allowed limited information on these individuals on the express condition that such information is used solely to provide services for the covered persons. 

A violation of Clause 5 //explicitly grants the Foundation carte blanche to perform outlined retaliatory actions in Clause 617// (in such a case, most likely formal containment of Goldbaker-Reinz as an SCP item and the covert economic warfare necessary to do so.)

++++ SCP-6987-B321: Lifted Veil

Should the Foundation&#39;s operations be made public in such a manner that the Foundation&#39;s ability to preserve human life is put at risk;
Goldbaker-Reinz will provide the Foundation with monthly payments adequate to purchase dominant advertisements on channels defined in clause SCP-6987-B321.1, including but not exclusive to:
* Primetime TV,
* Radio,
* Noospheric memeplex injection,
* Social media marketing,
* Moon billboard.
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
++++ SCP-6987-B505: Puppet Assassination

In the event that a puppet state established by the Foundation is overthrown, AND the resulting regime either 
* (a) is markedly less politically stable or 
* (b) causes disruption of normality by disrupting containment of dangerous forces;
Goldbaker-Reinz will compensate the Foundation with 5 years&#39; pre-revolution expected GDP for the state in question.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
++++ SCP-6987-B666: Wrath of God

--Available to all Foundation Personnel working with religious anomalies-- Available to all Foundation Personnel.

Payment terms: 1 minor religious (Akiva-emitting) artifact per 5,000 personnel enrolled, yearly.

Should an employee of the Foundation be killed by a deific or Tartarean entity (defined as Akiva-emitting or Tartarean-Emitting); 
and said being uses its abilities to consign your: 
* Soul,
* Identity matrix, 
* Mind-ghost, 
* Spirit echo,
* Other such remnant; 
To a specific Tartarean punishment such as:
* Hell,
* Tartarus,
* Niflheim,
* Gehenna,
* the Jaws of Ammit,
* Diyu;
Goldbaker-Reinz will intervene such that your eternal soul will proceed to the afterlife on natural terms without interference.
