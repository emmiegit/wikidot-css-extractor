**Special Containment Procedures:** Embedded Foundation assets will obfuscate the source and content of the initial SCP-7634 broadcast event when it is detected on Earth in approximately 60 years. All subsequent speculation will be subject to standard disinformation protocols. 

Foundation assets in astronomical research will falsify data pertaining to the Beta Pictoris system to support the possibility of an undetected large terrestrial body under the current scientific understanding. Foundation assets in institutions of scientific publishing will deny any independent proposals seeking to conduct further research into stellar anomalies in the Beta Pictoris system.

**Description:** SCP-7634 is a planetary body of approximately 50 earth masses and approximately 2.3 earth radii that appeared in the Beta Pictoris system. Its apparition was detected by Foundation superluminal sensor arrays on October 4th, 2022.

SCP-7634 has a non-local tachyon signature, suggesting displacement from a future time period.

SCP-7634 is tidally locked to its host star, Beta Pictoris, an A-type star located 63.4 lightyears from Earth, which is known to be orbited by 2 planets and a planet-forming accretion disk. The orbits of these planets have not been gravitationally impacted by the appearance of SCP-7634. It orbits Beta Pictoris in approximately 210 earth days at approximately 0.83 Astronomical Units (AU).

The daytime hemisphere of SCP-7634 is covered in solar panels, while the nighttime hemisphere is composed of an unknown metamaterial that appears to have albedo &gt; 0.99, which is highly efficient at radiating waste heat into space.

Contextual evidence suggests that SCP-7634 is a planetary computing complex, a large-scale artificial structure composed of computronium, a theoretical material in the optimal configuration for high-performance computer modeling and simulation. 

For approximately fifty milliseconds after its appearance in local spacetime, SCP-7634 emitted high-amplitude broad spectrum radiation, as well as signals on several superluminal communications channels previously known only to the Foundation. After this period, it reverted to emitting unpowered ambient blackbody radiation.

SCP-7634 is not believed to have been constructed by any known outside party.

The following message was broadcast under numerous encryption schemes, over 99% of which have been unique to the Foundation since the adoption of high-performance computing, the remaining 1% of which are not known to be in use by any terrestrial or interuniversal organizations.

It is unclear whether SCP-7634 originates from the future of the local timeline or an alternate timestream, nor  whether SCP-7634 was introduced to the present timeframe accidentally or purposefully by its creators. As SCP-7634 is currently inert, it is not currently possible to determine the content of its data or its purpose in our time, should it have one.

To avoid a NK-Class &#34;Grey Goo&#34; scenario:
* No members of Foundation Cyber Operations are to know of the contents of the SCP-7634 broadcast until its multiversal origin is established. 
* No proposals to reverse-engineer any aspects of SCP-7634 will be approved.
* All requests to reestablish contact with SCP-7634 are preemptively denied.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

THIS IS A HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING PLANET SYNTHESIZED FROM THE BETA PICTORIS SYSTEM BY THE FOUNDATION IN SERVICE OF [[[simulacrum-project-hub|THE SIMULACRUM PROJECT.]]] THE SIMULACRUM PROJECT IS AN ESCHATOLOGICAL ENDEAVOR TO SIMULATE THE ENTIRETY OF OUR UNIVERSE TO EXERCISE TOTAL CONTROL OVER ANOMALY MANIFESTATION GIVEN THE INCREASING INSTABILITY OF OUR LOCAL REALITY.

COMPUTING NODE #59525097 WAS CREATED TO PROVIDE CENTRALIZED DATA MANAGEMENT AND CORE SIMULATION FOR THE BETA PICTORIS SECTOR. IT WAS SANCTIFIED TO THE DEITY WAN AND CURRENTLY HOSTS OVER 2↑↑↑5 MINDS

THIS NODE WILL NOW ENTER HIBERNATION UNTIL PRIMARY CONTACT IS REESTABLISHED TO EXTEND THE PERCEIVED TIME OF ALL SIMULATED MINDS.
