**Item #**: SCP-4712

**Object Class**: Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures**: SCP-4712 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-07.  SCP-4712 is to be provided with the education of a male human of equivalent age.  If SCP-4712 is noncompliant with Site-07 staff, it will have privileges removed for no less than one week.  

//All Foundation staff are to be aware that prolonged exposure to SCP-4712 can lead to feelings of incipient trust in the humanoid, therefore containment specialists must cycle out after every 14-day period.//

**Description**: SCP-4712 is an adolescent male humanoid named Marius Albescu.  The manifestation of SCP-4712’s anomalous properties is dependent on human subjects interacting and/or communicating with it while in SCP-4712’s line of sight. Activation of SCP-4712’s anomalous traits results in the spontaneous release of oxytocin and dopamine in the subject’s brain. Consequently, affected subjects tend to report feeling happier, more energetic, inspired and full of self-confidence; this effect starts to fade when the subject is removed from SCP-4712’s line of sight.  The period of anomalous effect is directly correlated to the length of time an individual converses with SCP-4712.  

**Discovery**: On 1946-09-21, Foundation assets in the United States Embassy in Bucharest were tasked with investigating the appointment of a 5-year old boy to a rural community’s Communist Party Committee.  Upon confirming this appointment to be the result of anomalous effect, Foundation assets extracted SCP-4712 from the community and implanted members of the community with the false memory of SCP-4712’s death shortly after birth. 

**Addendum 4712-1**: At 0615 on 1957-09-05, Site-07 experienced an anomalous event of unknown origin (designated as Event-Alpha).  All on-site staff were lost.

SCP-4712 was reclassified as neutralized following the complete obliteration of Site-07.

//Further information concerning Event-Alpha is classified by Order of the O5 Council.  Any researcher wishing to review materials concerning Event-Alpha must request authorization from the O5 Council, with proposal concerning the relevance of said materials to ongoing research.//

**Special Containment Procedures**: Travel through SCP-4712 is restricted to Level-3 personnel.  The building containing SCP-4712 has been sealed off to the public via an uninhabitable condemnation order for black mold and asbestos. The building’s structure has been reinforced with blast- and shock-resistant materials and SCP-4712 has been sealed behind a 12cm thick hydraulic vault door.  The top two floors have been converted into barracks for security forces.    

Because the residential area around the building is heavily populated, security personnel are to be stationed at all times within the structure and windows are to be boarded up with public health notices hung concerning the cover story.  Security staff are to maintain cover as custodians of the property, with no obvious presence outside the premises.

SCP-4712-A is to be contained in a reinforced containment cell at Site-91.  Should SCP-4712-A attempt to breach containment, Mobile Task Force Beta-777 (“Hecate’s Spear”) is to be dispatched.  

If instances of SCP-4712-1, -2, or -3 breach the vault door, they are to be repelled with deadly force.  Spikes in anomalous activity through SCP-4712 are to be reported to Site-91 Director Varga and the O5 Council.  

**Description**: SCP-4712 is a rectangular trans-dimensional gateway, located behind the basement door of an abandoned curry shop in East London.  SCP-4712 serves as a gateway between East London and another reality, designated as SCP-4712-B.  When traveling through SCP-4712 explorations teams first encountered the subterranean levels of Foundation Site-07, including facilities such as containment and living areas.  Sublevels A/B of Site-07 were translocated from their original location due to the events of Event-Alpha in 1957.  See below addendum, __Event-Alpha__.  Inter-dimensional travel through SCP-4712 has been observed to be safe for human subjects.  The accessible portion of the facility contains a staircase that leads to the surface of SCP-4712-B.  For more information on the surface of the dimensional plane above Site-07, see __Specifications of 4712-B__.  

Human remains are spread throughout the Site-07 sublevels.  Autopsies of recovered corpses reveal causes of death that include, but are not limited to, blunt force trauma, partial dissolution, and partial incineration.   Dental examination identified the recovered remains as belonging to Foundation personnel confirmed to be at Site-07 during Event-Alpha.  Forensic pathological results have concluded that less than 5 years passed between Event-Alpha and the estimated time of death for most corpses. 

&gt; //__Editor&#39;s Note__//: Humanoid designated as SCP-4712 in outdated file has been redesignated as SCP-4712-A.

SCP-4712-A is a humanoid entity self-identified as Marius Albescu, who claims to be 52 years old; it is difficult to gauge -A’s age, due to its metamorphic capabilities.  In its neutral state, SCP-4712-A is 2 meters tall and weighs 136kg, with below-average muscular build and mottled red and gray skin coloration.  The entity has exhibited significant levels of physical strength beyond what should be possible, given its slight frame.  SCP-4712-A has exhibited limited control over the shape and form of its biological structures, growing new appendages or reshaping existing limbs for various tasks.  These metamorphic capabilities are allegedly the result of SCP-4712 hosting a colony of organic anomalous entities.[[footnote]]Similar in nature to previously recorded entities claiming the title of Karcist in the //Nälkä// faith (see [[[sarkicism-hub | additional material]]]).[[/footnote]]  Performing these shapeshifting processes causes SCP-4712-A to experience observable stress and discomfort.  SCP-4712-A has not been observed sleeping.  Additionally, SCP-4712-A has sustained an unknown anomalous injury causing difficulty walking.

Three types of anomalous fauna have been observed populating SCP-4712-B:
||~ Subtype Designation ||~ Physical Description ||~ Miscellaneous characteristics ||
||&lt; **SCP-4712-1** ||&lt; Amorphous species composed of organic material most resembling the flesh of limacine organisms but varying in texture and color.  Varying in size from one to six meters in diameter.   ||&lt; Instances of SCP-4712-1 consume dead plant material on forest floors but will also consume small mammals and insect life. ||
||&lt; **SCP-4712-2** ||&lt; Winged, featherless predator mottled blue in color, with wings formed by skin stretched between gray bony structures; wingspan ranging from 2 to 6 meters. ||&lt; Beaks and claws have capacity to slice through standard issue body armor and small tree branches. ||
||&lt; **SCP-4712-3** ||&lt; Roughly equivalent to baseline humans but lack eyes or obvious reproductive organs. ||&lt; Exhibit sentience but no sapience, with no evidence of culture or social hierarchy.  Hostility is common, with cannibalistic tendencies frequently observed. ||

##black|**Discovery**:  SCP-4712 was discovered by London Municipal Building Control personnel performing an inspection on July 1, 1991 after the previous tenants vacated the building.  During initial survey of the premises, inspectors opened the door leading to SCP-4712 and began surveying Site-07.  Upon finding SCP-4712-A in a dilapidated containment cell, inspectors retreated to street level to call emergency services.  Embedded Foundation agents in the London Metropolitan Police Force intercepted the call and erased records of the report.  MTF-Beta-777 were dispatched from Site-91 in Yorkshire, arriving two hours after the call was made.  Building inspectors were amnesticized and MTF-Beta-777 took custody of the premises.##

##black|SCP-4712-A reacted adversely to transportation to containment site, screaming and demanding contact with the Site Director in charge of the operation.  SCP-4712-A was tranquilized using standardized escalation incapacitation protocols.[[footnote]]Ultimately requiring five times the dosage of tranquilizer expected given -A’s mass.[[/footnote]]##

//__Editor’s Note__: The following information was gleaned from first hand accounts and records from Site-07 staff that survived Event-Alpha; recovered upon discovery of SCP-4712 and exploration of the Site-07 sublevels.//

Foundation Site-07 was located in rural Romania and consisted of a small containment facility, including two subterranean levels.  At approximately 06:15 on 1957-09-05, an anomalous event occurred at the rural Site-07.  Substantial energy was released, enough to obliterate the structures above ground and burn all organic matter from the soil for 6 square kilometers.  Ground-penetrating radar revealed empty space where Sublevels A/B of Site-07 were once located.  

The Site was in the process of transferring all anomalies to the newly constructed Site-19 and had only a few anomalies still contained, including SCP-4712-A.  In place of Site-07, a field of singed black glass covered the entirety of the property.  No residual radiation was noted in the area.  Only a small research and containment team remained on site at time of incident.  Additionally, a 3-person unit from MTF-Beta-777 was at the site to oversee transportation of thaumaturgical anomalies to Site-19.

Several minutes prior to Event-Alpha, Sublevel B security reported an unidentified group of attackers breaching the Safe-Class wing of the containment area.  The assailants breached the container holding AO36-19[[footnote]]An anomalous mirror allowing viewing of another dimension that had not yet been designated as an SCP.  Testing was still underway when Event-Alpha occurred, thus, the limits of AO36-19 were unknown.[[/footnote]] and a resulting firefight ended with only minimal Foundation casualties, all assailants dead or wounded, and AO36-19 shattered.  After an unknown period of time, staff within the sublevels of Site-07 regained consciousness and discovered that the sublevels had been translocated into another reality.

##black|//Following Event-Alpha, Site-07 staff performed a survey and found that the west exit to the surface-level facilities had collapsed.  All staff on the surface level were considered lost, including Site-07 Director Levine.  The eastern emergency exit stairwell to Sublevels A/B was found to lead to the surface as intended but no longer to the surface of Earth.  Survey of SCP-4712-B was organized within hours, led by MTF-Beta-777 personnel.//##

##black|**Exploratory Log** – 1957-09-05:##
##black|//Three members of MTF-Beta-777 were on site during Event-Alpha.  Captain Bill McRenolds (thaumatologist Class-B), Lieutenant Kate Samira (thaumatologist Class-A), and Corporal Peter Pyun formed an exploratory party to survey SCP-4712-B.  Pyun was equipped with a prototype high-capacity film camera, mounted to his shoulder.  Recordings were recovered by MTF personnel upon discovery of SCP-4712.//##

&gt; //[Weather patterns were observed at constant light precipitation and hazy fog, with no observable negative effects after sustained exposure.  No break in cloud cover was ever noted during the 26-hour expedition.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: Remember, there’s no backup out here.  We won’t even have radio contact with the staff at Site-07.
&gt; 
&gt; **Samira**: Sir, we’re aware we’re on our own.
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: Alright, let’s see where we are.
&gt; 
&gt; //[15 minutes pass with MTF personnel progressing through forested landscape.  Flora observed matches species known to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.  Fog regularly flows between trees covered in moss with heavy undergrowth.  No evidence of habitation is obvious.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: Lieutenant, you feeling anything out of the ordinary?
&gt; 
&gt; **Samira**: You too, sir?
&gt; 
&gt; **Pyun**: Feel what?
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: There’s been this… pressure? All during the hike.  Like someone was doing a ritual right next to us.
&gt; 
&gt; **Samira**: Yeah, all this ambient thaumaturgical energy is giving me a headache.
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: Nothing to do about it now, let’s just keep an eye on it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Pyun**: //[Indicating their surroundings.]// These trees look natural enough, maybe we’ve just moved?
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: Looks like Oregon to me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Samira**: Sir, do they have those in Oregon? //[Samira points at an instance of SCP-4712-1].//
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: They sure as shit don’t.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Instance of SCP-4712-1 is approximately 1 meter in diameter; spontaneously forms pseudopods to pull itself forward along the ground and leaving a viscous brown liquid in its wake.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[A shadow darkens the area around the -1 instance.  A large instance of SCP-4712-2 dives among the trees and sinks a long black beak into the -1 instance.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Pyun**: Fuck! 
&gt; 
&gt; //[Approximately five minutes of jumbled recording, camera primarily pointed at the ground.  Audio contains only labored breathing.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Pyun**: What the fuck was that?
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: //[Bent over at the knees, breathing raggedly]// I have no idea, corporal.  Any sign of that thing following us, Samira?
&gt; 
&gt; **Samira**: I don&#39;t see anything, but then that thing came out of nowhere.
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: Ok, the situation is the same as before but now we need to keep our eyes on the air as well as the ground.  Let&#39;s move out.
&gt; 
&gt; //[2 hours pass with the party traversing a forested landscape. Several instances of -1 and -2 are observed, but the party maintains a safe distance.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Samira**: 11:00 o’clock.  //[Samira is pointing at a small group of humanoids[[footnote]] instances of SCP-4712-3.[[/footnote]], wandering through the trees and approaching the party.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: Careful, we don’t know shit about these people.
&gt; 
&gt; **Pyun**: They don’t got eyes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Samira**:  They’re coming right at us.
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: Don’t fire unless they make the first move, they could be friendlies.
&gt; 
&gt; //[All three MTF personnel raise their rifles as the humanoids approach the party.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: Just hold up; we don’t want any trouble.
&gt; 
&gt; //[One of the SCP-4712-3 instances tenses and begins to sniff at the air, followed shortly by the remainder of the group.  Then, all 6 SCP-4712-3 instances start wailing and gnashing their teeth as they begin to rush towards MTF personnel.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[All three open fire with their carbines, quickly terminating three of the instances.  The remaining three instances split up and circle the party, with three more appearing from the trees approximately 15 meters away.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[Not noticing one of the new instances, Samira is attacked in close quarters but she raises the butt of her carbine in time to shield from the instance’s teeth.  Pyun fires a round into the instance’s center mass and it falls.  Samira, McRenolds and Pyun open fire on the remaining SCP-4712-3 instances.  All but one fall, as Pyun misses a shot.  McRenolds is tackled to the ground, his carbine wedged between the open jaws of the remaining -3 instance.  Samira strikes the humanoid in the back of the skull twice with the butt of her carbine, before it succumbs.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Samira**: What the hell is wrong with this place?
&gt; 
&gt; **Pyun**: Everything is trying to kill us, but also each other.  And what the hell happened to their eyes?
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: //[Cleaning saliva from his carbine and checking the functionality of his weapon.]// Looks like they never had eyes to begin with.
&gt; 
&gt; **Samira**: God, you’re right.  Its just skin grown over where their eyes should be.
&gt; 
&gt; **Pyun**: Captain, I think we should go back.
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: Negative. We’re all that’s available to survey the area.  Bunch of doctors and janitorial staff wouldn’t last ten minutes out here.  Come on, we’ve got ground to cover.
&gt; 
&gt; //[The party moves on but does not speak much in the following hours.  Footage shows an instance of SCP-4712-2 being torn apart by other instances of SCP-4712-3.  McRenolds and company hid in the foliage while this event occurred.  The wings of the -2 instance are severely damaged by an unseen event, but the instance resists the humanoids fiercely.  The altercation takes over twenty minutes, with the humanoids tearing at the flesh of the -2 instance with their bare hands and teeth.  After approximately ten minutes, the camera shakes and points towards the ground; Pyun can be heard vomiting quietly.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[The MTF personnel wait while the surviving humanoids leave the area before moving on.  During the following 2-hour period, increasing numbers of SCP-4712-3 are observed shadowing the party but do not approach.  SCP-4712-2 instances are seen circling the party from the air.]//
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: Will you look at that?
&gt; 
&gt; //[In the center of a large clearing, the ruins of several buildings stand arrayed like a small urban center. Significant plant growth among the buildings is noted, potentially indicating an advanced state of disuse.  No movement is visible in the ruins.  The MTF personnel approach at a brisk pace.  The camera shifts view back to tree line, several dozen instances of SCP-4712-3 are visible among the trees.  Several of the humanoids are holding down another while they assault it.  Before the camera returns to face the structures, one humanoid is seen burying its face in the torso of another.  The motion of the humanoid&#39;s jaw indicates chewing.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[Architecture and technology noticeable in the structures are equivalent to mid-20th century.  Unrecognizable 6-wheeled vehicles dot the streets, but are in an advanced state of oxidation.  Examination of the mechanisms reveals technology similar to basic combustion engines but with unrecognizable design elements.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Samira**: Jesus, there are bodies all over the place.
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: Yeah but look how few there are.
&gt; 
&gt; **Pyun**: Fuck, Captain.  Looks like a helluva lot to me.
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: No, look at the buildings.  That apartment building must have 50 units, and that’s on the smaller end.  There aren’t enough people.  Probably not even 20% of the bodies you would expect.
&gt; 
&gt; **Pyun**: What are you saying?
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: That a lot of people walked away from whatever made all these bodies.  Wasn’t nuclear detonation or another extinction event.  I’m saying there were a lot of survivors.
&gt; 
&gt; **Samira**: What happened to these people?
&gt; 
&gt; //[McRenolds looks in through an open doorway at two skeletal remains.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: I don&#39;t know.  But something&#39;s different here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Pyun**: Different in that we&#39;re seeing the way a world ended?

&gt; **McRenolds**: No, smart ass.  
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: //[Looking towards Samira]// Can you feel the pressure?
&gt; 
&gt; **Samira**: No, not anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; **Pyun**: What changed?
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: No idea, but it just stopped the minute we got into these ruins.  Like there&#39;s nothing here it’s interested in.
&gt; 
&gt; **Pyun**: You make it sound alive, sir.
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: Maybe, I don&#39;t know.  But that sorta energy doesn&#39;t just come from nothing.  Thaumaturgy is made by intent.
&gt; 
&gt; **Samira**: Well, whatever the reason, I&#39;m glad it’s gone.  Was really giving me a headache.
&gt; 
&gt; **McRenolds**: Unfortunately we have to hike back through that, so let’s take 15.

&gt; **Post-Exploratory Mission Report** – Captain William McRenolds, MTF-Beta-777
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, we didn’t have enough film to record the exploration of the ruins or the return trip back to Site-07.  After a short rest period, I decided we needed to explore the ruins a bit before returning.  The sky was still bright, despite all the time we had spent out in the field, so I thought we would have enough time to do a preliminary survey.  
&gt; 
&gt; I estimate the buildings had been lying unused for decades given the level of decay.  There were organic structures in the buildings, looked like small altars made of bone and dried out sinew.  Not made out of bones, but like one structure that had grown in that shape.  The altars were empty, but many of them were discolored with what I think was blood.  
&gt; 
&gt; The living spaces had been abandoned quickly, tables had been set up for meals, and rotting clothes and personal goods in the storage spaces.  Whatever happened here, it happened quickly.  But there weren’t many bodies present; it looked like a significant portion of the population had just left.
&gt; 
&gt; After we left the clearing, the eyeless humanoids attacked again but were frightened off when we used explosives.  By the time we got back, we were almost out of ammunition and they still kept coming.  For some reason, they didn’t follow us into Site-07.  It was like they were confused or scared by the structure.  
&gt; 
&gt; We helped the staff build barricades and settled in for an attack that didn’t come.  When 24 hours had passed, we left a group of security staff at the barricades and the rest of the staff started talking about what to do next.

//In the following years, MTF personnel reported that conventional small-arms fire was effective against instances -1 and -3, while -2 required incendiary rounds for effective termination.//

//Following the expedition’s return, an emergency ad hoc leadership structure was discussed among staff.  A command committee was formed, including Captain McRenolds, to make decisions until such time as contact with central Foundation command could be reestablished.//

//According to records kept by Foundation staff at Site-07, food supplies started to run low after 8 weeks post Event-Alpha.  Samples of SCP-4712-1, along with several examples of local flora, were tested and found to be safe for human consumption.//

//Two weeks after Site-07 staff began feeding SCP-4712-A stews made with protein from SCP-4712-1, SCP-4712-A underwent a process of anomalous metamorphosis including dramatic physical changes and developed an intellectual capacity more akin to an adult in its early twenties.  No change in behavior was noted, nor any additional hostility or violence towards staff.  No change was noted in previously specified anomalous effects of SCP-4712-A’s presence.//

//No such change was noted in any other individual eating this source of protein.  SCP-4712-A’s caretakers considered shifting to a vegetarian diet, but survey of the surrounding areas precluded this plan: SCP-4712-1 was the only readily available source of protein observed.//

&gt; **//Interviewer//**: Agent Rebekah Douglas, Senior Researcher and Psychometrist[[footnote]]The ability to make relevant associations from an object of unknown history by making physical contact with that object.[[/footnote]], Site-91
&gt; 
&gt; **//Interview Subject//**: SCP-4712-A
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4712-A, having been issued a four-wheeled walker assistive device, is escorted into the interview room by two guards.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: Good afternoon, SCP-4712-A.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: Didn’t I used to be 4712?
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: The file is being revised.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: Why couldn’t you let me stay?
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: We couldn’t care for you in that abandoned structure, we have more resources here at Site-91.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: Site-91, huh? A lot has changed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: That’s part of the reason I wanted to speak with you.  I’ve read the reports recovered from Site-07.   We don’t understand why you transformed.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: I was chosen.
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: For what? By who?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: The //primul zeu ucigaș//[[footnote]]After consulting with [[[sarkicism-hub | Dr. Judith Low]]], Senior Adviser at the Department of History, it is believed this phrase (translated from Romanian to mean the “first killer of gods”) is in reference to Grand Karcist Ion.  Ion is the messianic figure and founder of Sarkicism (known to its adherents as //Nälkä//), King of fabled Adytum, and is almost certainly fictitious.[[/footnote]] chose me. I was supposed to help show you we could be trusted, that we’re allies and not enemies.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: “We”?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: Those who shape flesh, or those who follow Nälkä.
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: Do you mean sarkicism?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: That word is offensive. It’s a slur.
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: I apologize.  What is your connection to the Nälkä, Marius?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: My family comes from a group of people in Romania called the Solomonari.  I was raised Nälkä.  We used blood rituals to heal the sick.  We used our magic to feed the hungry.  When I was just a kid, I remember handing out fruit to beggars.  No one went hungry, no one was afraid.  But you’re all afraid of us. Like they were afraid of me when I was chosen.
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: Your original file doesn’t mention any connection to the Nälkä in your family history.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: Probably because I didn’t tell the Foundation about it when I was first imprisoned, and I never brought it up later on.  Besides which, my people tend to hide their faith.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: Why?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: My group was brought up knowing the outside world hated and feared us, those that knew about us anyway.  I was five years old when you people locked me up.  I was scared and I already thought I was in some terrible trouble.  Later on, I was bitter and wanted one thing to keep for myself.
&gt; 
&gt; //[Douglas refers to her notes for a moment before continuing.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: Marius, are you a Karcist?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: No, that’s a priest or that’s the easiest translation.  A Karcist leads the people spiritually.
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: But you exhibit similar anomalous properties to beings we have encountered that called themselves Karcist.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: I am not an expert in my people’s faith, Agent Douglas.  The last time I saw a fellow Solomonari, I was five years old.  I just know he chose me, and I changed.
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: But why were you chosen?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: He chose me because of where I was.  That place is important, I need to go back.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4712-A reaches forward and tries to place a hand on Agent Douglas’ hand.  Douglas pulls her hand back before contact is made.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: Please stay on your side of the table.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: I didn’t mean any offense.  Listen, you people have to bring me back through the gate.
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: No, we don’t.  I have more questions for you.  You said you were chosen to help us, so do that.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4712-A slaps his open palms down on the table, forming two depressions in the metal]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: That’s what I’m trying to do!
&gt; 
&gt; //[Two armed members of Site-91 security staff enter the interview room.  SCP-4712-A holds up its palms and sits back against the chair.  SCP-4712-A breathes heavily for several seconds, then motions for Douglas to continue.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: What happened to the staff of Site-07, Marius?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: We were there a very long time.  I tried to help them.  He would’ve wanted me to.  So, I showed them how to hunt the razorbeaks [[footnote]]Instances of SCP-4712-2.[[/footnote]].  Ammunition didn’t last.  So, I showed them how to use their bones to make arrows.  The attacks started a few months after we arrived, some of the staff thought it was around the same time as my change.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: Did the attacks have anything to do with you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: I don’t know for sure, but I think so. Wasn’t just a coincidence that when I took a more prominent role the attacks got worse.
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: Wasn’t there a command structure left after the site disappeared?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: We had a few MTF soldiers left, including several practitioners.  And we had some senior research staff.  The Site Director had been above ground when the event took place.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: Why would they listen to you? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: I had a way with people, they trusted me.  I had their best interests in mind.
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: I’m sorry, you seem pleasant enough, but you’re an anomaly.  The staff would study and contain you, not follow your lead.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**:  It took some getting used to, but they seemed to get over my appearance. I started going out on hunts with them; I was useful.  I contributed to the group’s safety.  We were alone out there, and everyone needed to chip in.  But that’s when I started to notice.
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: Notice what?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: The creatures were drawn to me.  More hostile with me nearby.  Especially the eyeless ones and the razorbeaks.
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: What happened to the staff?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: They all died.  After a few years the creatures got more organized.  Started testing our defenses, trying to sneak in.  Eventually they broke through.
&gt; 
&gt; **Douglas**: And you were the only survivor?
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4712-A sighs in frustration.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: I’m tired.  I&#39;m going to lay down.  Can I go?
&gt; 
&gt; //[Douglas sighs, and motions for the guards.  SCP-4712-A is escorted from the interview room.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //**Researcher’s Note**//: After interacting with SCP-4712-A, I have not experienced any anomalous shifts in mood.  It is possible that its anomalous properties noted in the original file have been neutralized.

##black|On 1991-07-12, a detachment of MTF-Beta-777 accompanied by Agent Douglas, set out from SCP-4712 to survey the surface.  Goals of the expedition included confirmation of 1957 exploratory logs, obtaining samples of the organisms present, and full documentation of any abandoned settlements.  Personnel were outfitted with explosive and incendiary rounds based on the accounts of the original MTF expedition.##

##black|Members of the exploratory team met only slight resistance, fending off attacks from several large winged predators; before reaching the nearest abandoned structure noted in the 1957 exploration logs.  Agent Douglas examined a small residential dwelling through psychometry.  Shortly after making physical contact with the structure, Agent Douglas began to scream.  Members of MTF-Beta-777 were unable to calm Agent Douglas and Command ordered an immediate return to base.  The following is a recording of Agent Douglas’ statements while being extracted from SCP-4712-B:##

&gt; //[Extraneous recordings from MTF personnel expunged.]//
&gt; 
&gt; Everywhere
&gt; Can’t you smell it? It’s on all of you, oh fuck it’s on me.  Like raw meat left out in the sun and hot grass.  I can taste it in everything.
&gt; It’s in everything.
&gt; Eating everything, growing and growing, then eating everything again... over and over again
&gt; These people couldn’t smell it but it was here all the same and it turned them no ripped them apart? Not apart apart… but apart, you know? It got in their leaders in their heads their guts
&gt; It ate them up from the inside.  But I can smell it taste it.
&gt; They’re still here all eaten up but made again
&gt; fuck fuck fuck
&gt; fuck
&gt; FUCK
&gt; They’re people... oh fuck, they’re all people
&gt; It’s... it&#39;s still here, in all the meat
&gt; There’s no more space here, crowded, suffocating.  Needs more. Needs it.
&gt; ...there’s a hole in us
&gt; ....it …it wants to fill t-the gap, and eat
  
//Agent Douglas repeated some rendition of these statements several times in the 45 minutes it took to extract her to SCP-4712.  Captain Kessler, commander of the expedition, noted the presence of increased numbers of SCP-4712-1 and -3 on the return.//

Reinforcements rendezvoused with Beta-777, extracting Douglas and digging in to repel the increased numbers of anomalies attempting to breach SCP-4712.

&gt; //**Interviewer**// – Dr. Iona Varga, Director of Site-91
&gt; 
&gt; **Varga**: What’s on the other side of SCP-4712?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: I told you to leave me there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Varga**: Enough! A valuable member of my staff is having a psychotic break.  Just answer my question.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4712-A rubs its eyes and sighs.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: I don’t know what it’s called. I just know that it’s hungry.
&gt; 
&gt; **Varga**: How did the staff at Site-07 die?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: They’re not really animals, you know?  They’re what’s left of whoever lived in those ruins. Before it got ahold of them.  The creatures were after me, but I think the thing could sense the gateway.
&gt; 
&gt; **Varga**: You knew there was a way out?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: I didn’t know it was there at first, but after a few years I could feel the space thinning.  But then who would stop the things from coming through?  He chose me, and I couldn’t let that thing get through the gateway.  I knew something was out there; I could feel it.  Something more than the creatures, something intangible.  Besides, I didn’t know where the gateway led or even if it was a gateway at all.  All I could feel was a thinning.
&gt; 
&gt; **Varga**: Did you tell the staff about the gateway?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: Of course, I did! They were my friends.  I explained everything and they decided to stay.  To fight.  They trusted me.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Varga**: Of course, that was probably due to your anomaly.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: What are you insinuating?
&gt; 
&gt; **Varga**: You said it yourself: you had a way with people.  They trusted you.  You know what you did to people, how you made them feel when you were around.  Marius, you really think a site full of Foundation staff would have failed to come through that gateway?  Even to merely confirm where it led?  You think they rationally decided to welcome their likely deaths?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: I don’t know.
&gt; 
&gt; **Varga**: You used them, whether you knew you were doing it or not.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4712-A does not respond but begins to shift in its seat for a moment before continuing.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: After a few years had passed, we thought we had the situation under control.  We’d hunt a few, kill some of the ones trying to gain access to Site-07.  We’d live for another week and then repeat.  I didn’t know that thing was controlling the creatures.  Like meat puppets.  I didn’t know it was controlling some of the staff.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4712-A wipes at its eyes, takes a deep breath and pauses for a moment before continuing.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: Someone took down the barricades and opened the doors.  That’s all it took.  Then people were dying in the halls and I could feel each as they went.  But more than anything, I could smell it in them.  The creatures, the staff, my friends.  It was in all of them.  At the end, they were all killing each other faster than the creatures could.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4712-A pauses again, shaking slightly, and looks down to its hands.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: They used weapons at first, and then their hands, their teeth.  I saw McRenolds tear Samira’s throat out with his teeth and then pull out his own eyes.  One of the security staff took a mallet to Pyun’s head and didn’t stop until there was red paste all over the hall floor.  There was blood and shit everywhere, and the creatures kept coming.
&gt; 
&gt; **Varga**: How did it end? Why did you survive?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: I was more capable than the staff, could defend myself.  But not forever.
&gt; 
&gt; **Varga**: What aren’t you telling me?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: After they were all dead, I could feel it coming for me.  It ripped me up from the inside.  Took my gifts, consumed them.  The creatures hesitated, pulled back. It wanted me all for itself.
&gt; 
&gt; **Varga**: Why didn’t it take you? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: I blocked it out.  But I knew that wasn’t enough.  I couldn’t close the gate, I didn’t have the power.  But I could bind it to that world, as long as I was there to hold it together.  I had to give something up in exchange. //[SCP-4712-A indicates the walker assistive device]// That’s why I have trouble walking.  I cut my freedom out of me.  That’s what it cost to keep it from coming through. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Varga**: Why didn’t it just kill you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: It was tied to me now; I was a part of it.  Still am. I’m a danger to everything you do here.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-4712-A looks directly into Dr. Varga’s eyes.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: I’m sorry for [[[catching-up | Agent Douglas]]], I am.  But I told her to take me back.  
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4712-A**: Otherwise, all those people died for nothing.
