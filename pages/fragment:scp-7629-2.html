**Specifications:** VNP-7629 is a species of sapient reptilian humanoids with physical characteristics of dragons known as Droganians “//Draconis Sapiens//“.[[footnote]]Also referred to as SkyFolk, and recently Children of the Sky.[[/footnote]] These characteristics range from scaly skin that come within a range of colors and patterns, slit reptilian eyes, large retractable leather wings with a wingspan of 2.13 m on their backs, horn-like protrusions on their foreheads, pointed frilled ears, forked tongues, five fingered clawed hands, and digitigrade legs with five toed clawed feet. They possess numerous natural and thaumaturgical abilities such as being able to transform into large dragons of varying shape and size, emit a blast of flames from their mouths that can be condensed to resemble the blast from an industrial blowtorch, having a heightened sense of smell, See in infrared, can sense and see EVE, and can withstand intense temperatures.

Droganians are the descendants of ancient dragons who were known as the Sky Keepers &#34;//Draconis Primogenitus//” by the Fae and Yeren. They possess the highest levels of EVE of any known species sapient and non-sapient, as well as being highly knowledgeable and skilled in the ways of thaumaturgy. Droganians are also skilled in the fields of philosophy, mining and the study and manipulation of precious metals. They are capable of speaking a variety of languages including English, Polish, Latin, Sumerian, ancient Greek, Proto-Nordic, ancient Chinese, modern Chinese, Nälkä, Mekhanite, Fae, Yeren, and their own native language called Dragina.

Through the partnership between Vanguard, formed by their predecessors The SCP Foundation, Droganian society has highly developed their structural architecture and have developed their own advanced thaumaturgically based technology comparable to that of the Yeren, the style and visual characteristics of their architecture and technology is comparable to that of both medieval/Arthurian and 3rd Dynasty Chinese design, melded with ancient Egyptian spiritual architecture, but with a slight futuristic feel that has been dubbed “Ancientpunk” by the public. Examples of their technological creations include the following:

* __Gargoyles:__ Hovering jet bikes capable of great speed and traversing on both solid ground and water. They are usually meant for a singular individual, but two seater models do exist, but are not as common. As the name implies, they partially resemble marble gargoyle statues commonly seen in and on gothic buildings.

* __Way-line Gates:__ Portable devices capable of generating stable Ways for fast travel, the designation of these ways can be inputted prior to being generated. These ways can safely remain open for as long as the user wishes.

* __Ragnarök Pumps:__ Geothermal generators that harness energy through the flow and intense heat generation of magma. These devices can withstand temperatures up to 2075°C through means of high temperature resistant thaumaturgic runes and sigils carved upon a vast number of the device’s components. Note: A major percent of the city of Arcadia is powered by multiple Ragnarök Pumps.

* __Leviathans:__ Large underwater submersibles capable of withstanding massive amounts of underwater pressure as well as great speed even when submerged. They also possess built in spectrum reflectors which allows the vessel to become practically invisible.

* __Scholar’s Voice:__ Collars and ear pieces that instantly translate the words spoken by an individual into the hearer’s primary language. They were the result of a project lead by Alistair Vehmoff, head of translation and linguistics of Vanguard’s Site-120.

* __Eden’s Gift:__ Partially bio-organic purifier pumps. They absorb all forms of toxic and/or hazardous substances and/or waste  within it’s environment and converts it into clean energy which can be used as a source of alternative fuel. These devices were created from both Droganian and Yeren technology as part of a collaboration between the two species authorized by their respective leaders.

* __Oathborn’s Lance:__ Collapsible long tipped spear staffs composed of Aldulium.[[footnote]]A strong and very heavily thaumaturgy conduction metal of Droganian origin. Created from mixing white gold and irrilite, the latter being a precious metal used by Fae during the age of Mab and the Fae Empire.[[/footnote]] Users skilled in thaumaturgy can transfer EVE into the staff, this activates a mechanism that splits open the spear tip revealing a barrel with a crystal tip, this turns the staff into a blaster capable of firing concentrated bolts of energy. These traits lead to it becoming favored among the Droganian Armada. __Additional Info:__ Captain Agron of the Droganian Armada possesses his own specially designed custom model he has dubbed Astarot, in honor of his father.

A major portion of the Droganian population resides within their ancestral home, the underground city of Arcadia (FP-129). However, many can also be found living within numerous Free Port Nexuses such as Esterberg. The Droganian government within the city of Arcadia is led by an aristocratic court known as the Dragoon’s Circle, a council of 13 Droganian nobles with 12 of them each being the head of a specific department, while the 13th member and leader of the circle being the Vajra King, the patriarch of the Droganian species, with the current being the 19th Vajra King, Ragna Von Morrowind.

**Normalization Protocols:** Many VNP-7629 denizens have already found themselves residing within numerous Free Port Nexuses, with Esterberg being a major one. Vanguard representatives of Site-120 have developed plans to incorporate VNP-7629 into non-nexus communities. These plans include the following:

* The people of VNP-7629 will be gradually introduced to public communities. Starting with Eastern settlements such as Europe and China, before proceeding with Western settlements such as the U.S.

* Numerous means of educating the public on all info regarding the culture, history, religion, and biology of VNP-7629 will be administered. These will range from books, documentaries, interactive videos, as well as copies of official documents from the city of Arcadia.

* The technology and practices of VNP-7629 will be made known and available to the public, with strict guidelines and rules for public safety and security measures.

* The public will be granted access into the city of Arcadia as both a means to build public relationship and as an effective means to introduce the people to the culture of VNP-7629. Plans to construct a larger more effective means of accessing the city are ongoing.

* The Vajra King Ragna will be hosting numerous meetings with nation leaders to establish relationships and to allow the people of VNP-7629 to be granted full citizenship.

**VNP-7629 Normalization Document-1:** Transcript of VNP-7629 Normalization Video

The following is the transcript of an educational video produced by Site-120 on the history and culture of VNP-7629, the video is one of several episodes of an ongoing documentary series.

//”Special thanks to Dr. Daniel Asheworth, Jessie Rivera,[[footnote]]Jessie Rivera had retired from Vanguard prior to the recording of this documentary, but volunteered to assist in production, due to her part in the discovery of VNP-7629 and the forming of the partnership with Vanguard.[[/footnote]] and Anna Szulc for participating in the scripting and filming of this document.”//

//The video opens up with a black fade in as it slowly zooms in on a mural depicting many different forms of dragons in all kinds of colors soaring through the sky, with a larger shining four winged dragon with black scales with gold pattering in the middle.[[footnote]]Depicting the deific entity Bahamut. Fully known as Bahamut The Sky Lord “Emperor of Wind and Father of The Sky Keepers”. A deity of major religious importance in the Droganion society, stated to be the creator of their species.[[/footnote]]//

//Narration begins to play, provided by Dr. Daniel Asheworth.//

**Asheworth:** Dragons…The most well-known, fantastical, and powerful creatures in all of the legends of man.

//It fades in to another mural depicting nobles and philosophers sharing stories of dragons to crowds of people.//

**Asheworth:** For many years, the people of all cultures have spread many stories and legends about these amazing creatures and the wonders they were capable of, as well as the powers they wield.

//It fades to a mural of a armored knight on a horse going into battle against a fire breathing dragon.//

**Asheworth:** From courageous knights and heroes going into battle against ferocious dragons to save a princess and/or his kingdom…

//Fades to a mural depicting a Chinese emperor and a group of monks being blessed by a serpentine dragon.//

**Asheworth:** To wise emperors and buddhas of the ancient dynasties being granted wisdom and blessings of luck and fortune from noble serpents from the heavens.

//fades to a panoramic mural depicting many different stories involving dragons of all kinds. It pans slowly to the right, displaying each section of the mural.//

**Asheworth:** For as long as the earth has turned and civilization has progressed, stories about these creatures have come and gone for thousands of years, showing up in both our stories, and even our dreams…But what if I told you they do exist, and they are as powerful as many of the stories depict them? But they are more than what the stories you’ve heard lead them to be, and are far more than meets the eye!

//It then shifts to a viewing of all the ancient murals found within the tunnels leading to the VNP-7629 home of Arcadia.//

**Asheworth:** They were not mere animals…they were an intelligent society and their own people, known as The Sky Keepers! They were as smart as you and I, if not smarter. They ruled the skies and study all they came across, learning ancient secrets and discovering ancient treasures that one can only dream of! But they didn’t keep this knowledge all to themselves, they shared it with the many different people of the world. They shared it with us humans, the majestic Faeries, and the intelligent Yeren. In fact, they were the one who revealed the ancient art of magic.

**Asheworth:** Unfortunately, things would soon go bad for the Sky Keepers. The first danger was the one called Bahji,[[footnote]] Known as Bahji The Savage “Empress of the Cold, The Violent Tigress”. A malicious deific entity that went to war with the dragons with the intent of regressing them into savage creatures.[[/footnote]] a dark god of violence and chaos. She despised them for their nobility and intelligence, and so set out to turn them into violent monsters, aided by her servants the Chuba. The dragons went to war with Bahji and her Chuba, and eventually were able to defeat her and lock her away to never return.

**Asheworth:** The second and greatest danger however…was Queen Mab, an ancient and evil Faerie queen who desired to steal the powers of the dragons and become unstoppable. She sadly succeeded in stealing some of their power and began to crave more. She began hunting them and sucking them dry, and began building a powerful empire, one that once ruled the earth for thousands of years. Fearing their extinction, the dragons were forced to go into hiding, going underground where they remained for hundreds of thousands of years…never to be seen again.

//It then fades to black for several seconds before a logo of a broken lock with the Vanguard emblem, along with the title “Beyond the Veil”[[footnote]]An educational documentary series created and sponsored by Vanguard to inform the public of many forms of anomalies and groups. The series was eventually included on numerous streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu.[[/footnote]] in big bold text in front fading in.//

**Asheworth:** …Until now, that is. //This// is Beyond the Veil!

//The video shifts to a room resembling a laboratory with a whiteboard with the BTV[[footnote]]Short for Beyond the Veil[[/footnote]] logo printed on it. Below it written and outlined in black marker is the words “Subject: VNP-7629 (The Droganians and Arcadia)”. To the left is a tall, lanky young man with slightly messy long black hair. He’s wearing a black suit and a lab coat, with gloves that have magic runes on them. In the middle is a slightly beige woman with blue eyes and long blonde hair in a braided ponytail. She’s wearing thin glasses and is wearing a long sleeve green jacket with the BTV logo in yellow on the shoulders over a bright gray tanktop, black jeans and dark brown boots. On the right is a Fae woman with navy blue hair in a braid-less upstyle haircut. She’s wearing a red violet beanie along with a similar attire to the blonde. The difference being the jacket having short sleeves, and a black sleeveless crop top exposing her midsections.//

**Helen:** Hello, this is Beyond the Veil! Where we give you all you need to know about the world of the strange and unusual that is the anomalous. I’m your host Helen Cambridge with my assistant Kelly Gaignory. Joining us today is Dr. Daniel Asheworth, head of Vanguard Site number 120! In this episode, we’ll be covering what is labeled VNP-7629, also known as the Droganians and their home of Arcadia!

**Kelly:** This will be another journey about an intelligent species of people. If you’re already familiar with our episodes on the Fae, Yeren, and the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/orcadia Finfolk], then you know how this will go. So, care to tell us what we need to know about today’s species, Helen?

**Helen:** I believe it be better to let our guest give us the rundown. If you’d please Mr. Asheworth?

**Asheworth:** Of course. Now, if the little prologue at the beginning gave you the general idea, the Droganians are the dragons known in ancient times as The Sky Keepers. However, we’re not just talking about large winged reptiles that breath fire and use magic, much like with all forms of life, they change and evolve over time.

//A title card of the BTV emblem appears on screen, with “Appearance and Biology” displayed in big bold font. This title card stays on screen before shifting to Daniel Asheworth in front of a 3D projection of a male and female adult Droganian.//

**Asheworth:** As you can see currently displayed before you, the Droganians are a humanoid species of reptiles. They have all the standard qualities of humanoids, bipedal, opposable thumbs, and intelligent enough to be capable of thought and emotion. The difference is that they have many of the common characteristics one would expect from dragons. They have smooth scaled skin that can appear in any color and any pattern you can possibly imagine, their eyes have slit shaped pupils instead of the common circular pupils, they have large tails, they have horns growing from their foreheads, their ears are pointy with frills comparable to a lizard, they have claws on both their hands and feet, and their legs are digitigrade. But the most recognizable physical aspect is their wings. They’re large with leather folds and can reach a wingspan of 2.13 m. They’re very strong as they allow Droganians the ability to fly, capable of flying at great speeds and with impressive acrobatics. Also yes, since they’re reptiles, they do shed their skin.

//The male image enlarges and moves to the center of the projection.//

**Asheworth:** When it comes to gender differences, male Droganians typically have a much more muscular body shape.

//The male image shrinks down as the female image enlarges and moves to the center.//

**Asheworth:** While females on the other hand typically have a much more slimmer body shape.

//Both projections go back to their original size and positions.//

**Asheworth:** Now when it comes to abilities, the Droganians have numerous.

//The projection than changes to show all the different natural and anomalous abilities that the Droganians are capable of.//

**Asheworth:** The first ability is a form of shapeshifting. To put it simply, Droganians are capable of altering their physical form, undergoing a thaumaturgical transformation into a secondary form. The physical appearance of this form is different for each member, but it pretty much takes the form of what one would commonly label as a dragon. They are still capable of vocal communications and are far more powerful than they are in their humanoid form. They also as you might’ve already expected, have the ability to emit fire from their mouths. They not only can do this both in humanoid and dragon form, but they can also condense these flames to be equivalent to the blast from an industrial blow torch, and even is capable of cutting through metal just like one.

//The projection than changes that to show a silhouette of a human, Fae, Yeren, Finfolk, among several others. They all have a fluctuating bar graph next to them, some of the graphs are higher than others.//

**Asheworth:** Now I’m sure you all know about Elan Vital Energy, or EVE. A mystical energy all living things have that can be harnessed to do magic. We humans too have EVE, however certain species and entities emit more EVE than others.

//Droganians suddenly appear on the projection, with their chart being greater than all other races.//

**Asheworth:** But when it comes to the Droganians, they to date possess the highest levels of EVE of any known species or entities on record. However, when in their human forms, their EVE is much lower as it acts as a form of limiter. But, when in dragon form…

//The Droganian silhouette changes from humanoid form to dragon form. Their EVE chart than rises tremendously to the point its height can be compared to a large house.//

**Asheworth:** Their full power is revealed.

//Another title card then pops up on screen, this one titled “History and Folklore Influence”. Much like the last one, it stays on screen for three seconds before changing. This time it shows a large library, where both humans and other humanoids can be seen browsing through the many books upon the shelves. The screen is focused on a woman who looks to be around her fifties or sixties. She has long red hair and purple eyes, wearing a brown long sleeve coat over a white dress shirt, and tan jeans.//

//An introduction card pops up below saying “Jessie Rivera” (Retired Site 120’s Head of Human Resources and Personnel Satisfaction).//

**Rivera:** Hello there. I’m Jessie Rivera, I&#39;m a former member of Vanguard’s Site-120 and the previous head of HR and PS. I&#39;m also a good friend of Dr. Daniel Asheworth’s who was brought along due to being an expert when it comes to the study of thaumaturgy and sapient humanoid species. Now, much like many of the other sapient humanoids that we know of, the Droganians ancestors have had a huge influence over many myths and legends of many cultures around the world. Unfortunately while a number of aspects from myth and legend in regards to dragons are in fact true, there are those that are however entirely false or misconceptions.

//She then walks off screen as it shifts to a section of the room with a projector screen. She walks back into screen next to the projector screen.//

**Rivera:** Let’s start off by explaining the correct aspects of dragons.

//The projector screen turns on, presenting a chart showing four different forms of dragons. A standard quadruped, a wyvern, an Asian serpent, and an amphiptere.//

**Rivera:** Now, there’s never been just one form of dragon. Much like dogs, there have been many different interpretations, breeds, and/or sub-species of dragon depicted in myth and legends. Such as with the standard four legged western dragon, or the foreign eastern serpentine dragon. This is actually partially true! Although they’re not sub-species or different breeds, the dragon form of the Droganians can take many different shapes and characteristics, as the appearance of their dragon form is unique to each individual, although certain traits can be shared among blood relatives. From what we’ve gathered, the appearance of their dragon form and even some aspects of their humanoid forms depend on two components, individuality and a genetic lottery.

//The projection changes to a chart of the Droganian birth and development cycle. Starting from inside womb, to the laid egg, to hatchling.[[footnote]]While newborn Droganians are capable of learning to transform, their dragon form takes the appearance of a short wyrm with two tiny still developing pair of arms. This form changes drastically as they develop over time.[[/footnote]]//

**Rivera:** The first component of their form depends on the individuals personality that they develop as they mature. For example, Droganians who are active and are interested in work regarding strength, then they’ll most likely take the form of a highly muscular quadruped, while those that are intelligent and interested in gathering or sharing knowledge will most likely that the form of an asian serpent. The second component depends on specific genes that they possess. While the Droganian fetus is developing both in the mother’s womb and their eggshell, they will have a pool of special genes that all represent a different physical quality that a Droganian will possess, such as the type of color and pattern of their skin or whether their dragon form will have hair, feathers, both, or none. As the fetus develops, these genes begin to die out, and whatever genes remain prior to birth will determine what characteristics the infant will have as they further develop in their egg before hatching.[[footnote]]The Droganian reproduction cycle follows a mixed principle of live birth (viviparity) and egg laying (oviparity). The fetal development follows the same nine month time period as other humanoid species. However, the first half has the child developing within the mothers womb, which is then layed by the mother as an egg to develop for the second half before finally hatching. Note: Droganian eggs are very durable and can handle intense temperatures, though high temperatures are very beneficial to the eggs development.[[/footnote]] However, no matter what form they take, all Droganians in both forms will possess a pair of wings. Now some of you are probably thinking, “What about water dragons”? Well, //&lt;slightly chuckles&gt;// That’s a unique scenario, although Droganians are capable swimmers.

//The projection changes to an illustration of an Asian dragon looking down on an Asian monk in the middle of meditation.//

**Rivera:** In mythology from eastern cultures like China and Japan, dragons were described as being wise and all-knowing creatures. Ones who shared wisdom, knowledge, and blessings onto others, especially those who proved worthy and noble.

//The projection changes to an illustration of a western dragon sleeping atop a massive pile of gold and jewels.//

**Rivera:** It was also stated in western cultures that dragons were known to horde treasure and valuable relics, which they would protect. Both of these are not only true, but are also part of one major aspect of their history.

//The projection changes to an illustration of dragons presenting groups of humans, Fae, Yeren, and others gifts such as relics and tomes.//

**Rivera:** In ancient times, the Droganian’s ancestors gathered vast knowledge and treasures from all corners of the world, who they also chose to share with other sapient races so they can prosper and thrive. In fact, they were the ones who bestowed the knowledge of magic. They were basically all-powerful magical scholars and archeologists.

//The projection changes to an illustration of a dragon surrounded by waves of energy and magic, while it is emitting a huge plume of fire.//

**Rivera:** Dragons were also said to be incredibly powerful creatures, both in regards to physical strength and the art of magic. Though I’m sure you’ve already figured out that this is true as well. Even to this day, the Droganians have the highest level of EVE, or magic energy than any known creature, with their full magical prowess evident in their dragon forms. Now we’ve covered the true aspects of dragon myth, now let’s covered those that are wrong or misunderstood.

//The projection changes to an illustration of a knight on a horse battling a red dragon.//

**Rivera:** Now, in most western myths such as in Arthurian or standard fairy tales, dragons were depicted as fearsome terrifying beasts, usually one that is evil. These dragons are usually slain by a noble knight or warrior, usually to protect their home kingdom or to save a damsel princess. This is an example of a “role-reversal”, as the good guy and bad guy are mixed up. Dragons were wise and noble creatures who helped other societies become greater. True they were powerful and fearsome creatures, but they were not malicious. There never actually was any proof of the existent of evil dragons in ancient times. However, this idea most likely originated from a fact regarding another false or misunderstood ideal. As for the noble knight or warrior, those who went to battle dragons were actually individuals who had evil intent that attacked them, as they sought to steal the dragons’ powers for themselves. In fact, it was one of these evil individuals that drove them into hiding.

//The projection changes to an illustration of the Yin and Yang insignia, along with a tiger representing Yin and a dragon representing Yang.//

**Rivera:** In Chinese mythology, there is the concept of the Yin and Yang. Two universal forces that both compliment and contradict each other. The white half Yang, representing light and the heavens, is symbolized by a dragon. While the black half Yin, representing darkness and the mightiest of beasts, is symbolized by a tiger. Two forces representing a form of balance that are evenly matched and can’t dominate the other. This concept actually appears to have some of its roots of origin drawing back to the Sky Keepers and their history, even if it was unknown at the time. Also this concept is actually something of a half-truth. To better explain this, I decided to bring in someone who would be more familiar with Droganian history.

//Entering from the right side, a slightly thin Droganian man with maroon colored skin walks in. He also has well combed dark chestnut hair, and wheat brown eyes. He’s wearing a white dress shirt and black dress pants. He shakes Rivera’s hand.//

**Rivera:** Thanks for taking time out of your schedule to assist us today, Senbu.

**Senbu:** Don’t mention it. I’m actually more than eager to assist if it means helping others learn about our history and our people.

//Senbu then turns towards the camera as another introduction card saying “Senbu Drak” (Private of Arcadia’s Droganian Armada) pops up.//

**Senbu:** Greetings fellow viewers, I am Private Senbu Drak of the Droganian Armada of Arcadia. I have come here because I’ve been told you are learning the history of my culture, as well as comparing it to some of the human myths and legends.

**Rivera:** Yes, and we were actually wondering if you can explain the roots of the concept of Yin and Yang from your society’s history, as well as the inconsistencies regarding it.

**Senbu:** Oh, I see what you mean. Of course, I’d be more than glad to help out. (To the camera) Well to start off, one aspect that is correct is that how there are two forces that are symbolized by a dragon and in a way, a tiger. These actually refer to two deities in Droganian society that are not only part of our religion, but our also part of our history. One we praise, and the other we detest. The one we praise is Bahamut The Sky Lord, also know as “The Emperor of Wind and The Father of The Sky Keepers”. He is our divine ancestor who brought our people into existence and blessed us with both our high mana and intelligence. The one we detest is Bahji The Savage, also known as “The Empress of the Cold and The Violent Tigress”. She was a malicious goddess of chaos, violence, and the darker instincts. She despised our kind for being so wise and intelligent, so she along with her race of servants called the Chuba, launched attacks on our ancestors, taking away their minds and turning them into violent killers. This lead to what we call The War of Wisdom, a mighty and destructive battle where our ancestors, lead by Bahamut himself, fought against Bahji and the Chuba. We were victorious in the end and Bahji along with the Chuba were sealed away in an obsidian cage that was then buried in the deepest pit, which was closed with a golden monolith, never to return.

**Rivera:** Quite an amazing story if I say so myself. Are there any other inconsistencies that you’d like to point out?

**Senbu:** As a matter of fact there are. Now I assume when some see that the dragon represents Yang and the tiger represents Yin, that they imagine that the dragon would be white and the tiger would be black right? Well, the truth is it’s the other way around. Bahamut had deep black scales with a golden pattern, while Bahji had pure white fur with jagged blue and purple stripes.

**Rivera:** I see, an understandable incorrect detail. By the way, what else can you tell us about your history?

**Senbu:** Well, after the war had ended in our victory, we went to our usual way of live. We continued to spread wisdom and knowledge to other races, but we also took time to mourn those lost due to Bahji‘s attacks, or who died during the war. For many longs year we once again peacefully ruled the skies…But not for long. Sadly, as many of us had expected, evil would come to crave our power and the many secrets that we protected, which led to many hunting us so they can steal it for themselves.

**Rivera:** They started attacking your people?

**Senbu:** Indeed. However, all who attempted this ended up miserably failing. We didn’t let them go unpunished though, as many were cursed or had their will to manipulate mana taken away for their shameless greed and wickedness. No one ever managed to succeed in stealing our powers and knowledge…except for one. Are you familiar with the Fae Empire?

**Rivera:** Why yes I am. They were an ancient and powerful empire of Fae that once ruled the planet hundreds of thousands of years ago. It was ruled by two queens, Mab and The Inventor.

**Senbu:** Correct, and it was the first sister who succeeded. We called her The Mad Queen Mab. She like all the rest desired to steal our powers and learned the secrets that the Sky Keepers protected, and she did. But she didn’t just stop there, as she continued to drain the mana from more of our ancestors, growing more powerful with each victim. In fact, it is very likely that The Fae Empire and Mab never would have risen into power if she failed. We try to fight back, but unfortunately, she managed to drain enough that we were no match, even when she didn’t have her armies backing her up. We tried everything we can at the time to stop her, we even prayed to Bahamut and our second god Pangloss, but they didn’t hear our pleas for help. We were beginning to fear the worst, believing her crusade would lead to our people’s demise. So, we were left with no choice but to hide underground, and the rest is history. Over time we began to change and evolve, and we began to be consumed by fear and paranoia of ever going back out, it didn’t help that a scout party we sent in the past to ensure it was safe again never came back. We probably would’ve stayed down there, afraid forever.

**Rivera:** Until we found you.

**Senbu:** Correct! After the Foundation found us and learned about our history, they chose to help us and we became the society and culture you see today.

**Rivera:** Thank you for telling us this Senbu, it’s very appreciated. (To the Camera) Also, speaking of culture…

//Another title card then pops up on screen for three seconds, this one titled “Culture”. It cuts back to Helen and Kelly, only this time instead of a lab like setting, they are in a immensely massive underground cavern. Behind them is a bustling prospering city with many skyscrapers and a massive medieval lantern/cage like construct with a glowing orb centered within hanging from the cave ceiling, appearing to be some form of artificial sun. Many Droganian citizens, as well as a few other species can be seen in the backround.//

**Helen:** Here we are in the city of Arcadia,[[footnote]]By the time of this videos development, Arcadia had been officially approved to be recognized as a Free Port Nexus by Vanguard and the Dragoon’s Circle.[[/footnote]] the capital of the Droganian society and their ancient home. Isn’t it quite something?

**Kelly:** It sure is a sight alright! Can you believe that a few decades ago this place was just a primitive village?!

**Helen:** Quite incredible, and thanks for bringing that up. (To the camera) Before Vanguard’s predecessor The Foundation stumbled upon the Droganians, Arcadia used to be a more rural and primitive settlement. Most of the buildings were small and made with wood, with the exception of the royal halls of the Dragoon Circle and the Vajra King. They also didn’t have their own technology back then due to the fear of the activity caused by such tech exposing them to their enemies, who they weren’t aware at the time were long gone.

**Kelly:** But look at it now! There’s skyscrapers everywhere and they even now have access to the internet!

**Helen:** It just shows how much these people have prosper since the partnership with Vanguard. But we still need to go over their current culture and technology in detail, shall we?

//As they start to walk off screen, it cuts to them in the city downtown plaza, where many stands and establishments, both original to the city and well-known outside chains.//

**Helen:** As you can see, Arcadia not only has their own original businesses and forms of entertaining the public, but they also came to incorporate many familiar public establishments. Droganians in their ancient days already provided offerings to other races, so they quickly caught up with public businesses and shops.

**Kelly:** //&lt;points to a Starbucks&gt;// I guess even this place couldn’t end up without one of these on it’s streets. Heh?

**Helen:** Although I think we should focus on their own culture, lets start with their architecture.

//Cuts to them standing near a public library. The building resembles a small castle or a medieval structure, but it’s made of both well-polished metal and stone, as well as a more modern, advanced, and/or futuristic styling.//

**Helen:** As you can see, the structuring and style of Droganian architecture blends both ancient historical design and modern advance technological styling. Ranging from resembling either medieval and old European or 3rd Dynasty era Chinese architecturing.

**Kelly:** From what I heard, people have dubbed this style “HistoryPunk”, right?

**Helen:** That is correct, helps to show how much they’ve developed their own cultural practices. But this style isn’t reserved only for their buildings, it also applies to their technology! As stated before, The Droganians managed to develop their own advance technology that highly utilizes thaumaturgy to perform many incredible functions. For example…

//She proceeds to point up to the artificial sun in a lantern cage, as the camera focuses it on it.//

**Helen:** That giant glowing ball there, the one that looks like it’s a massive old European lantern or a massive bird cage? That’s what is called “The Spark of Sol”, an artificial sun that provides both light and warmth to the city below. It works by taking solar energy harnessed from the surface, then it concentrates and condenses the energy using thaumaturgical components and runes to form a small ball of solar light and heat. It pretty much //is// a real miniature sun, as the light provides sunlight to the plant life down here. It also has an attuned time schedule, as it shuts down for the night, then turns back on in the morning.

**Kelly:** //&lt;Whistles impressively&gt;// So they took sunlight and made their own sun? That is pretty crazy! Who knew you could do that with magical solar panels?

**Helen:** Speaking of solar panels, the Droganians didn’t just master solar energy, they also mastered geothermal energy!

//Cuts to them in front of a large glass dome, with a small lava lake inside, where a large engine like device in the middle. It’s pumping the flowing lava through and out as well as appearing to be sucking up something out of the air.//

**Helen:** This is a Ragnarök Pump, one of many in, around, and under the city. They are major source of power throughout Arcadia. It works by harnessing pure energy from the flowing lava it is semi-submerged in, as well as by harnessing the immense heat coming from said lava. Think of it as like a water wheel for lava.

**Kelly:** How does it not melt? I mean it’s in hot lava!

**Helen:** Good question. The reason it’s not melting is because when they build the pumps, they carve specific thaumaturgical runes on many of the parts and components. These runes basically produce an invisible heat proof shield that keeps the lava from causing the machine to overheat, thus preventing the possibility of it either melting, falling apart, or exploding. That’s the power of thaumaturgical technology, they can do things that normal machines wouldn’t be able to.

//Suddenly, something fast zooms past them, with two more following afterwards. This catches their attention and upon seeing what it was, Helen put on a smile.//

**Kelly:** What was that?!

Helen: That was actually another example of Droganian technology, and one of their most popular among the younger generation.

//The camera focuses on the moving object, which turns out to be a group of young adults riding hovering vehicles that physically resemble both a jet-ski and a gothic gargoyle spout.//

**Kelly:** Are those jet bikes?

**Helen:** Yes they are. Those are called “Gargoyles”, they’re Droganian hover-bikes that have become really popular among the younger crowd for how thrilling they are to ride, they also gained a following among dirt bike drivers and stunt performers. They also work as jet-skis since they also work on water, but usually only with special attachments for precautionary measures.

**Kelly:** They kind of look like something from an old videogame a friend of mine played as a kid, //&lt;starts rubbing her chin in thought&gt;// Actually, I think I seen some Vanguard soldiers riding one of those once.

**Helen:** It’s very likely you did. After all, Vanguard has immediate access to Droganian technology as part of their partnership.

**Kelly:** You keep mentioning this partnership, how did they form a partnership, and with who?

**Helen:** Excellent question, I think it’s time we discuss the governing power of the Droganian species!

//Cuts to them being lead by an armored Droganian guard up a huge flight of stairs. They now find themselves in a large courtyard grounds of a massive beautifully constructed royal castle-like structure resembling a Chinese temple or palace from the 3rd Dynasty era, but far larger and with some portions looking more modern and/or futuristic than others. This is implying that this building is much older than it looks, but was modernly renovated.//

//Numerous guards can be seen standing guard and keeping watch or on patrol as they march around the palace.//

**Helen:** This beautiful building right here, is the Royal Halls. It is the site of authority and government of Arcadia and the Droganian society in general. It is ruled by a council of nobles who call themselves the Dragoon’s Circle, led by The Vajra King, the high leader of the Droganians. It is practically the heart of the city.

**Kelly:** …Okay, I’m just going to say it. This place is starting to give me a real D&amp;D vibe right now! Not that there’s anything wrong with that. Also is it weird how that palace looks like it is older than it looks, despite the modern aspects?

**Helen:** You’re actually not far off on that feeling. The Royal Halls is one of the oldest buildings in Arcadia, as well as one of the only still remaining pre-partnership structures in all of Arcadia. It was smaller at the time, but still regal and beautiful. But thanks to the advancements in architecture and technology they accomplished, they chose to renovate and expand the Royal Halls into a bigger and more modern structure, while still retaining the original aspects of its design. Tradition in a sense.

**Kelly:** So like an upgrade? Yeah that makes sense. So then are we going to go see these nobles and—

//She gets interrupted as the sound of clashing metal and grunts become audible. They look and see the sound is coming from what appears to be a training session. Six younger looking Droganian guards are sparring against an older guard wearing a more detailed and durable looking golden armor. All of them had the face shield of their helmets down. They were all sparring using the same lance like weapon that looks ancient in design, but looks hi-tech in structuring.[[footnote]]Oathborn’s Lances.[[/footnote]] The golden guard however was using a far more detailed gold colored double bladed model covered in both etchings and engravings, as well as having two short royal blue ribbons tied to the cross guard piece of both blades.//

//When Helen notices the golden guard, she recognized them and smiled.//

**Helen:** Actually, I think I know someone who can gives us his input on the partnership’s start!

//She leads Kelly towards the ongoing training session. The sparring session seems to have ended as the golden guard gets out of his fighting stance as he twirls his lance one handed before collapsing it to a more shorter compressed length. He then starts speaking in Dragina. “which is subtitled for the convenience of the viewers”//

**Golden Guard:** That’s enough!

//All the trainees also get out of their fighting stances and stood prone in front of their superior.//

**Golden Guard:** Excellent work cadets…If you were trying to disappoint me that is!

//He proceeds to berate the trainees on what they need to do better as he points his compressed lance at each of them.//

**Golden Guard:** Dythira, you need to put more strength into your strikes! Ziru, greater speed and agility for countering! Cyg, Don’t just focus on offense, focus also on defense! Your lance is both your blade and your shield! Nere, A lance is for both slashing //and// stabbing, don’t just resort to the former!

//He then brings his attention to the last trainee, more annoyed with this one than the rest. A male Droganian with green scales and deep yellow eyes, who doesn’t seem to be taking this training session seriously. Aside from the other trainees, Helen and Kelly’s arrival goes unnoticed.//

**Golden Guard:** And you Loki! Will you please take this training seriously for once?! Zoron applied you to the Droganian Armada so you can learn discipline and responsibility! If it weren’t for the fact that your father is a good friend of mine, I’d have you—

**Helen:** (English) //&lt;clears her throat&gt;// Excuse me sir?

//He stop his ranting as his attention is shifted to Helen and Kelly.//

**Helen:** We’re doing a documentary on the Droganians and Arcadia as part of “Beyond the Veil” for Vanguard, we were wondering if you can answer some questions in regards to the partnership between your people and Vanguard.

**Golden Guard:** Oh, of course! I was actually informed of your eventual arrival by one of your Vanguard associates who arrived for a meeting with my superiors. Let me just take care of this first. (To the trainees in Dragina) That’ll be all for now, but I expect you all to work on improving your combat. Especially you Loki, I will not hesitate to put you on Mandrake uprooting duty as disciplinary punishment! Dismissed!

//The trainees all salute him as they all leave the perimeter, with the one identified as Loki muttering something in Dragina that was not translated due to being too explicit for younger audiences.//

**Golden Guard:** (In Dragina) I heard that!

//Loki’s eyes widen as he picks up the pace with a quick curse uttered.//

**Golden Guard:** Now then, I am Agron Skyrim, Captain of the Droganian Armada of Arcadia. I assume you wish to ask me some questions concerning my people?

**Helen:** Yes, I actually wish to question you in regards to the start of your people’s partnership with Vanguard. I am aware that you were involved in the events leading to it, correct?

**Captain Agron:** You are indeed correct miss. I was actually one of the first view who met with Daniel Asheworth, Jessie Rivera, and Anna Szulc when they came down here to negotiate in an alliance. I was even the one who led them to this palace in order to meet with the Dragoon’s Circle and our wise Vajra King Ragna Von Morrowind.

**Kelly:** Were you surprised to find humans showing up in your home?

**Captain Agron:** Yes we were. I assume you are already aware of our former paranoia in regards to the surface and its population?

**Helen:** Yes. Before the partnership was formed, your society was afraid of going back outside and of possible outsiders due to the attempted genocide on your ancestors by Queen Mab.

**Captain Agron:** Correct. Therefore when Asheworth and his colleagues revealed themselves, we reacted with extreme caution and a show of force. If it weren’t for Asheworth speaking to us in Nälkä as he tried to communicate in a language we might understand at the time, we probably would’ve driven them out of the caverns and be the same terrified people we were decades ago.

**Helen:** It was also stated that before their prior organization, The SCP Foundation arrived, your people thought the Fae empire was still around, right?

**Captain Agron:** Indeed. Since we never bothered to go back out to check if the surface was safe again, aside from one attempt that ended in tragedy,[[footnote]]Referring to an ancient incident where a Droganian scout party was sent out to determine whether the surface was safe to traverse, but never returned. Not long after Droganian citizens were introduced to Free Port Nexuses as part of the prior Foundation’s integration program, the party’s disappearance was discovered to be the result of a hostile assault by another race due to a misunderstanding.[[/footnote]] We were completely unaware that both the empire and The Mad Queen had long since fallen. In fact, it was learning that the empire was gone from Daniel Asheworth that led us to accepting a meeting of negotiation. Thus, we finally were free from our millenia long paranoia, and we became the civilization that you see before you.

**Kelly:** I’m guessing you got a lot of praise and rewards for trusting them and making all of //this// possible?

**Captain Agron:** I won’t deny that I did receive recognition and gratitude for helping start the new age of prosperity for my people.

//Pulls out his double bladed lance as he extends it to its full length.//

**Captain Agron:** This weapon right here was actually presented to me as a gift of gratitude by King Ragna himself for my bravery and choosing to trust our human visitors, leading to our prosperity. Of course I made some modifications of my own. I even chose to name it after my father Astarot, who was the previous captain of the armada that gave his life to protect our home, when it was suddenly invaded by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2191 the horde of a race of bloodsucking demons that emerged from a mysterious unnaturally formed cave] that was opened by accident during an expedition to expand our mines. Luckily we sealed that tunnel and placed seals that kept them from coming anywhere near our settlement. It was actually him and his sacrifice that motivated me to follow in his footsteps, leading to me becoming the new captain…He was my hero.

//He looks at Astarot with a sad smile, he then collapses it an places it in a holster on his hip.//

**Helen:** That is quite a noble and heartwarming decision, naming it after a loved one and idol. Thank you for taking your time to answer some questions for our documentary Captain Agron.

**Captain Agron:** Think nothing of it. I’m more than honored to assist, if it means helping others learn about my people and our culture. Is there anything else I can do to assist?

**Helen:** Actually there is, you said your leaders were holding a meeting with a Vanguard representative right? we were wondering if you can show us to where the meeting is taking place, we wish to catch footage of them as part of the documentary.

**Captain Agron:** Hmm, I suppose I can. But I’ll have to inform them first and see if they’ll approve of it before letting you into the meeting room. I’ll lead you there.

**Helen:** We’d very much appreciate it.

//Cuts to Helen and Kelly being led by Captain Agron through the halls and corridors of the Arcadian Sacred Halls. They come across many beautifully furnished and designed rooms, many of them containing samples of Droganian art such as marble statues and paintings. They also come across rooms with more modern and advance designs and features such as electronic security cameras and sensors, along with what appear to be thaumaturgic security barrier gates preventing access to those unauthorized. They also come across numerous Droganian nobles, aristocrats, and guards, along with some visiting tourists and citizens both Droganian and others.//

//They finally make it to a very long hallway filled with many beautiful stained glass murals[[footnote]]These murals tell the origin of the Droganians ancient predecessors The Sky Keeper, The War of Wisdom against Bahji and the Chuba, the attempted genocide on The Sky Keepers by Queen Mab known as The Mana Massacre, and the forming of the Round Table Partnership with the prior SCP Foundation.[[/footnote]] displayed on both sides of the hall, although one section of this hall of murals is currently under construction as a new portion is being added, depicting the Droganian’s survival and triumph over [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6500 a monstrous empty void]. Many citizens and tourists are viewing these murals with Droganian scholars explaining the story each portion tells. At the end of the hall is a large set of black double doors with the imagery of 13 gem embedded dragons carved upon it. A number of Droganian guards are standing guard.//

**Captain Agron:** This is the entrance to the Dragoon’s Circle grand meeting hall. This is where all political and emergency meetings between our leaders and visiting representatives are held. Let me just inform them so they don’t feel like you’re intruding.

//He gives an order to the guards in Dragina as they let him pass to enter. It cuts to them inside the meeting halls where Vajra King Ragna and the 12 other Dragoon members are in the middle of a discussion with a slightly chubby red haired woman with freckles,[[footnote]]Dr. Anna Szulc.

**Helen:** (To the camera) As you can see here, the leaders of the Droganian society are currently in a meeting with a Vanguard representative as well as a representative to both the Mekhanites and Nälkä. From what I’ve gathered, they’re discussing the possibility of the Dragoon’s Circle offering aid to all three groups in regards to, at the time of this documentary, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-first-occult-flame-war recent incidents involving more extreme and zealot members of both religions who stand against the idea of peace between them]. I’m sure they won’t mind if overhear a bit of what they say.

//The camera zooms in on the table as the voices of the group becomes audible.//

**Saint Hedwig:** -as already difficult in convincing many followers of the church to the proposal of peace between the Sa-//&lt;stops midway and coughs slightly&gt;// the Nälkä as it is. I almost barely managed to convince Robert Bumaro of the Broken Church to give peace a chance, and thankfully Legate Trunnion is more cooperative and reasonable when it comes to the Clockwork Orthodoxy, but even with their assistance we’re still dealing with the more violent followers of all three branches causing chaos for both us, the Nälkä, and innocent civilians caught in the crossfire! It’s gotten to the point where we fear these members will go rogue and form a violent splinter cell branch.

**Karcist Varis:** The same can sadly be said for us the Nälkä in regards to putting the past behind us. We too have our fair share of followers who prefer brute force and violence rather than cooperation and peace, not to mention when it comes to Klavigar Orok and his natural fondness for war and many of the more extreme and/or prejudicial Neo communities. While we do have followers including a number of proto communities such as the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sarkic-case-study-01-the-vas-n-a-of-sarvi Vaśńa], as well as both a few other Karcists and even Klavigar Nadox on our side…I fear most prefer the option of war.

**Szulc:** We at Vanguard have done much as we can to help put an end to the riots and aid those that were injured from the violence, but we haven’t had much luck in regards to stopping them entirely.

**Roldrinth:** Well, considering the millennium long war going on between your religions, I can’t be surprised that this would happen.

**Uninth:** That’s one of the many curses of war. Have it go on for too long, and peace will almost become a fleeting weary dream.

**King Ragna:** Wise way of putting it Unith, it is a sad truth that every group of factions who been in violent conflicts with one another for many years will always have those who would rather see the opposing side snuffed out forever rather than make amends. Though I can’t help but be amused by the irony that the followers of the religions based off Mekhane and Yaldabaoth, the sibling deities turned sworn enemies, are trying to make peace. Regardless, I still wish to know how you hoped we can provide aid in your ongoing conflict.

//Hedwig and Varis have their eyes widened in shock as they took their time to comprehend what was just said in regards to the major gods of their beliefs.//

**Saint Hedwig:** M-my apologies, but I think there was a glitch in my systems that bugged my hearing for a second. Did you say that Mekhane and Yaldabaoth are related?!

**Xazo:** Indeed. You two might be surprised to hear this if you weren’t already aware, but “The Iron Scholar” and “The Mother of Flesh” are actually brother and sister deities. Though they were the kind who didn’t agree with everything and didn’t always get along if it wasn’t obvious enough. Even the divine can have relatives and family, if the notion of “The Monarch of Blood”[[footnote]]Referring to The Scarlet King.[[/footnote]] having brides who gave birth to his sons wasn’t proof enough.

//Hedwig and Varis continue to stare dumbfounded at the information that was just brought down on them, with Hedwig clutching her head.//

**Saint Hedwig:** I’m sorry but… this is a lot to take in right now, I think I need a minute to compose myself.

**Karcist Varis:** I think it be best that I explain us coming to you and your citizens for aid. Since you are masters in the ways of mana and the magical arts as well as keepers of ancient knowledge, we were hoping that you could use some of that knowledge to convince the rebels that our two beliefs can put aside our bloody past and get along. We also thought your people would be a perfect example of how past violent conflicts can be forgiven and peace can be formed, considering how the Droganians are on good terms with the Fae despite the sins of the oldest malevolent monarch sister of their ancient empire.

**Szulc:** We were also hoping you can at the very least help us figure out a means of a possible compromise between the Mekhanites and Nälkä in case things don’t go as planned.

**King Ragna:** Hmm… //&lt;nod his head in understanding&gt;// understandable.

//He then stands from his seat as he seems to have come to a decision.//

**King Ragna:** Well then, how about we put this meeting on hold for now so that our circle can come to a decision in regards to your proposal, as well as to break for sustenance?

**Szulc:** Very well. Will come back to this some time later.

//As they all began to dismiss themselves, the camera zooms back to focus on Helen and Kelly.//

**Helen:** And with that, we have shown you the governing bodies of the Droganian society as well as given you a full idea of their culture. I can say for certain this was indeed quite an exhilarating and very knowledgeable experience, don’t you think Kelly?

**Kelly:** Oh believe me! I think learned quite a lot of crazy things today, and I’m a Fae!
//Helen couldn’t help laughing from Kelly’s comment.//

//Cuts back to the same labrotory setting in the beginning as Helen, Kelly, Daniel Asheworth, and Jessie Rivera are present.//

**Helen:** From the mighty flying serpents in the ancient past to the humanoid magic reptiles of today, the Droganians are indeed a very fascinating and influential species. Offering us knowledge that allowed many to grow and prosper, as well as bringing the very concept of magic to our minds! While they may have had their own share of tragedies and dark moments in their history, thanks to the people of Vanguard, they manage to become just as great as they were in the past!

**Kelly:** If you thought dragons were cool and crazy enough already, this must’ve definitely blown your minds!

**Helen:** I really like to thank both Dr. Daneil Asheworth and Jessie Rivera for joining us on this journey into the world of The Sky Keepers.

//Helen proceeds to shake Asheworth’s hand as Kelly does the same for Rivera.//

**Asheworth:** Just doing my duty as a member of Vanguard.

**Rivera:** It was a pleasure to be of assistance.

**Helen:** With that said, I’m Helen Cambridge, with my assistant Kelly Gaignory. Join us next time as we dig deeper into the crazy and abnormal world… Beyond the Veil!

**VNP-7629 Normalization Document-2:** Transcript of News Broadcast

The following is the video transcript of a CNN news broadcast of Vajra King Ragna Von Morrowind visiting VNP-7600[[footnote]]Formely SCP-7600 “the city of Druv&#39;tuul”, Ancient subterranean home of the Yeren.[[/footnote]] to conduct negotiations with the current ruler, Eldröl Gérunda.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

//The shot opens to a female avian humanoid resembling a raven on the scene near the front entrance to the royal palace. They’re wearing a dark purple gown resembling a clergy robe with hanging ribbons. She also wears what resembles a masquerade mask that covers only the left side of her face. She is being accompanied by a small squad of Vanguard security.//

//She begins speaking into the camera in a smooth and alluring European accent.//

**Lorãl:** To all who are viewing this momentous broadcast, I am Lorãl the Regal, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wandsmen-hub Wandswoman] of Esterberg, Lady of Unity and Reporter on the Societies of Wonder. We are currently live on the scene within the Yeren city of Druv&#39;tuul in front of the royal palace, where the leader of the Droganians, Vajra King Ragna Von Morrowind is to soon be arriving to discuss the terms of negotiations and trade with King Eldröl Gérunda to strengthen the friendship and equality between the two species.

//The camera catches the forming crowd of both native Yeren, visiting Droganians, and even a few humans and Fae near the palace who are waiting to see the events that are to unfold.//

**Lorãl:** Many both Yeren, Droganian, and even a few other intelligent races have gathered here today to witness this occasion. Many expected that this meeting would occur, what with the Vajra King’s meeting with the new Fae ambassador several weeks prior.

//The main gate suddenly opens as a line of Yeren royal guards march out and then form lines aside the royal walkway. A very muscular Yeren with golden brown fur followed right after striding down the walkway. He wore a chest plate of an organic metal with a royal seal etched on the surface, along with shoulder guards and large gloves with slight gold inlays. A flowing knee lengthed cape resembling both an animal loin pelt and a regal cloak was around his neck by an ornament, the ornament has the etching of a tree. Finally, a semi-organic golden crown like formation resembling a laurel levitated above his head. The expression on his face can be described as wise, fearsome, intimidating, but jolly and eccentric. In his right hand he wield what resembles both a royal regal scepter and a Viking war hammer, it was covered in Yeren religious and folklore iconography and was wrapped in vibrant green roots that let out a constant partial glow.//

**Lorãl:** Oh! We can now see King Eldröl making his way from the palace gates, very likely anticipating the arrival of his noble Droganian visitors. If the calm excited demeanor on his face tells me anything, is that he is eager to be a part of this event.

//Her attention is suddenly grabbed by a vibrating and glowing necklace charm she is wearing as she brings it up closer to her face.//

**Lorãl:** Speak now. //&lt;silent as she listens to the voice speaking to her through the charm&gt;// Hmm… yes, splendid. Many thanks Moru.
//She lets go of the charm as she brings her focus back to the camera.//

**Lorãl:** I have just received confirmation from my associate that King Ragna is about to arrive here via a Way-line Gate //way//.

//The second after speaking, a large portal opens on the opposite end of the royal walkway. King Ragna makes his way out of the portal accompanied by a squad of Droganian guards, accompanied by Captain Agron.//

**Lorãl:** And here he now arrives, accompanied by loyal members of the Droganian Armada, led by the noble and well-known Agron Skyrim, captain of the armada.

//The Droganian guards form two lines aside the royal hallway, much like the Yeren guards. King Ragna accompanied by Captain Agron make their way to King Eldröl, as the portal is guarded by more Droganian guards.//

**Lorãl:** The two leaders are about to make contact and the negotiation is about to commence. We shall focus on the two monarchs as they begin interactions.

//The camera and audio now focuses on the two kings as they now stand face to face as they immediately shake hands before King Eldröl is the first to speak.//

**King Eldröl:** //&lt;chuckles joyfully&gt;// It is quite an honor to finally meet you face to face noble king of The Sky Keepers. Welcome to the city of Druv&#39;tuul Al-lhad! I have been so eager to your arrival!

//King Ragna responds with a greeting in the Yeren language before continuing in English.//

**King Ragna:** The feeling is mutual, my friend.

//Hearing King Ragna give him a greeting in their language seems to greatly please him as he lets out a hardy laugh.//

**King Eldröl:** I see your reputation as knowledgeable scholars precedes you! To hear you speak in our native tongue pleases me so. (To Captain Agron) Ah, this must be the famous Captain Agron of your royal militia! I heard quite a number of the stories of your services for both your people and all others, including my own.

**Captain Agron:** I am quite aware of my reputation and fame, but I am humbled your majesty.

**King Eldröl:** Think nothing of it my lad, I am always humbled to have very well known guests within my home. (To King Ragna) Now then, I believe you wish to discuss various forms of trade and cooperation between the Yeren and Droganians?

**King Ragna:** Indeed, I figured it would be a wise and greatly beneficial choice to offer a partnership of trade and cooperation between our peoples. Since the Yeren were so eagered to help my people become familiar with the outside and offered aid on our road to prosperity, I feel it is only necessary to return the favor.

**King Eldröl:** Nonsense! We felt it was only right to help your people, in light of all that your ancestors have given and done for ours. Regardless, I wouldn’t mind the idea of trade. I feel we can learn a lot from you and what you can offer us.

**King Ragna:** In that case, let me present you the first of what we can offer your city.

//He turns to the guards standing in front of the portal and gives them a command in Dragina. They immediately obeyed as some went back into the portal. A few seconds after, many more Droganian guards come out followed by a large machine resembling a pump perched on a hovering trolley like vehicle.//

**King Ragna:** I present to you, the Ragnarök Pump! One of many found all around my home of Arcadia. These devices generate a major portion of the city’s power by using the flow of magma, along with absorbing the generated intense heat to provide energy. Since Druv&#39;tuul has an abundant of lava lakes, rivers and waterfalls, I believe it would be incredibly useful to the city as a power supply.

//King Eldröl proceeds to examine the device as he starts to contemplate the benefits of having such technology in the city. He examines it for almost two minutes before he focuses back onto King Ragna.//

**King Eldröl:** Yes, I can see this very useful in my home. Though we do have our own power sources, I definitely believe these will give us a greatly extra dose of juice to improve our work forces! I guess it’s about time we found a better use for all that lava! //&lt;laughs hardily&gt;// But that does beg the question, what do we offer in return for such a useful contraption?

**King Ragna:** I’m glad you asked. In exchange for offering some of our own technology, we were hoping you can do the same in return. Several our scholars and engineers are very fascinated with your chloro-technology and would like to learn the metaphorical “roots” of constructing and operating such organic machinery. Perhaps we can even collaborate on occasion and build devices utilizing technology from both our societies.

**King Eldröl:** Ah yes. That is very understandable, and it would only make sense that many would wish to learn how to create... //&lt;slightly chuckles amusingly&gt;// what the prepubescent humans call our “NaturePunk” machines. //&lt;laughs in amusement before clearing his throat&gt;// But with all said, we’d be more than delighted to teach you the ways of understanding and constructing our technology. As for the collaboration machines… I think I can arrange that.

**King Ragna:** Splendid! Than how about we continue this discussion inside the palace? I’ll even inform the rest of my circle to make their presence to save time and make things easier.

**King Eldröl:** Be my guest. I’ll even provide you and your council a taste of the finest feast that Druv&#39;tuul can offer.

**King Ragna:** Don’t mind if I do, good sir!

//The two of them then proceed into the royal palace as the guards of both nobles follow.//

//The sun was setting as many groups of friends and families of all different species were enjoying themselves in the lush and wide-open Coral Bay Park. Many were just relaxing and enjoying the view, while others were enjoying themselves in activities such as playing catch, throwing frisbees, fishing on the docks or one of the many rental boats, or just viewing the many Finfolk monuments or artwork put on display for visitors and tourists.//

//Jessie Rivera was currently on one of the parks several small hills sitting on a spread out picnic blanket. She was currently in the middle of a video chat with Daniel Asheworth and Alistair Vehmoff, who were currently within Arcadia as part of an assignment for Vanguard’s near finished construction of the new underground highway tunnel into the city.//

**Rivera:** So, I’m assuming the process is going well so far?

**Asheworth:** Definitely. We just finished the tunnel frames, and the road paving process is just about halfway done. All we need to do is set up the electrical wiring for the lights and it should be open for public use.

**Rivera:** That’s great to hear. Now people can have a much easier time getting into the city.

**Vehmoff:** Still surprises me to know that they approved the construction plans of a highway tunnel through the Ural Mountains. It probably wouldn’t have been green lit by the European and Chinese governments if King Ragna hadn’t offered them all that gold and gems.

**Asheworth:** Hey, he’s a king. Makes sense that he would know the in and outs of politics, especially the more questionable side.

//Rivera couldn’t help but slightly chuckle at the comment. She then overhears two familiar voices on the other end that are not too far from Asheworth and Vehmoff, catching their attention as well.//

**Guma:** I’m telling you, it’s just insane! To think, while we’ve been underground for thousands of years, the humans have managed to not only construct underground travelling routes that can go under mountains and large bodies of water like lakes or even the ocean, but they also made vehicles like cars that can reach a city or town in half an hour more or less, so they don’t have to spend so much time walking!

**Senbu:** That’s the main point of constructing this tunnel, an easier access and a transportation route.

**Guma:** Exactly! To think of all the crazy forms of transportation that exist nowadays. It honestly confuses me that some people still use horses as a means of transportation.

**Senbu:** Confused how exactly?

**Guma:** Because they seem pretty outdated compared to transportation today. Not to mention horses are dirt cheap, who would pay an arm and a leg for a dumb animal that you had to first domestic before you can ride it? That doesn’t even cover cleaning up the messes. You’re better off going for high quality.

**Senbu:** Hey, some people enjoy riding saddle. Plus, there’s horse racing sports.

**Guma:** Whatever. //&lt;takes a sip from a soda and a bite out of a burger he had on him&gt;// Mmm! Oh man I can’t get enough of these, who knew humans can make food this tasty?! I’m telling you we should’ve came out of hiding centuries ago if we knew we’d get stuff like this!

**Senbu:** What?! Bullshit! You were completely against the idea when we first met these guys!

**Guma:** What? what makes you think I was against it?

**Senbu:** Don’t play dumb with me! I clearly remember you saying, “It’s better to stay low and simple rather than draw unwanted attention from your enemies”.

**Guma:** That was before I realized all the awesome stuff we were being left out of!

**Senbu:** And by awesome “stuff”, you really mean the food.

**Guma:** Hey, at least we don’t have to worry about the possibility of food shortage anymore!

//Senbu was about to make a remark, before stopping himself as he thinks it over.//

**Senbu:** //&lt;sighs&gt;// Alright, you make a good point there.

//Rivera can’t help but chuckle at the two Droganian partner’s bickering.//

**Rivera:** I can see those two haven’t changed a bit all these years, yet so much about their lifestyle and society has. It truly is quite amazing to see how far they’ve come in just a few decades.

**Vehmoff:** //&lt;smirks&gt;// Now is it how you imagined it would look like?

**Rivera:** //&lt;scoffs amusingly&gt;// Oh shut up… but yes, I’ll admit it is. Keep me in touch with how the process is going so far. I may be retired from working with Site-120, but I’d still like to be updated on how things are going with you guys from time to time.

**Asheworth:** We definitely will. You take care of yourself.

**Rivera:** You too.

//She ends the video call and puts her phone away as she enjoys the peaceful moment. She then hears footsteps approaching her and sees Olivié Gwyneth approaching with a wave which she returns.//

**Gwyneth:** Sorry I’m a bit late, had to take care of some last minute cataloging of some new documents. One of the hassles of running city hall’s library.

**Rivera:** Don’t worry about it. I can relate a little before retirement.

//Olivié Gwyneth lays down on the blanket next to Rivera as they both enjoy the view and each other’s company.//

**Gwyneth:** But you no doubt must be proud of all that you and your friends have accomplished over the years.

**Rivera:** Yeah, I sure am. Just looking at all //this//, seeing how we now have a better world both for humanity and those that The Foundation has been keeping a secret for many years, and that we helped make it a reality always fills me with a sense of peace and accomplishment.

//They take their time seeing all the people of all types enjoying themselves. A boy and his father playing fetch with [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1550 a furry multi legged worm like creature with beady eyes and mandibles], a teenage Fae girl and Finfolk boy relaxing by the lake soaking their feet in the cool water, a Yeren working a grill for a barbeque with a group of friends, and a shy but adorable gray haired Mekhanite woman and a beautiful black and red haired Nälkä woman sleeping under a tree huddled together.//

**Gwyneth:** You really did do a lot for us. Sure some people still bring up all the bad things that you caused or had some part in, but the good things outweigh the bad.

**Rivera:** Yeah… Although I don&#39;t think it fully makes up for all the mistakes we made, I think I can say for certain that it helped us change our ways.

//Gwyneth nods her head in agreement, before she slightly fidgets as her cheeks turn a bit red as she gets nervous.//

**Gwyneth:** By the way, I never got around to tell you this because I’ve been either busy or a bit embarrassed just thinking about it, but… thank you.

//Rivera seems a bit confused by this as she raises her eyebrow at Gwyneth.//

**Rivera:** What for?

**Gwyneth:** …For helping that little girl’s dream finally come true after all these years.

//She then points to a group of Droganians having a good time as some of them perform some magic to entertain some of the local children, while others are entertaining themselves with some of their devices with people of other races. Some are riding Gargoyles as jet skis on the lake, while a female in an exotic dancer outfit is doing a fire performance, using her own fire breath to perform mesmerizing tricks while also dancing.//

**Rivera:** Oh! Yeah, they sure are quite a sight. They really are as amazing as the story you told me all those years ago claim them to be.

**Gwyneth:** I honestly thought I’d never get the chance to actually see them face to face, let alone helping them become an incredible society and civilization. I even heard some people call them Children of the Sky, isn’t that crazy?

**Rivera:** //&lt;laughs humourously&gt;// Their leader actually said that some use to call them that back then. I guess that just shows just how much they’ve become a part of this new world… It is truly a beautiful sight, isn’t it?

//One Droganian then transforms into their dragon form and takes off into the air, soaring through the sky as many of the park’s visitors look up at the display in awe and wonder.//

**Gwyneth:** //&lt;smiles softly&gt;// Yeah…
