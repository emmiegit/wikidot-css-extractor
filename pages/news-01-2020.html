You will notice little &#39;📈&#39; emojis beside some articles. That denotes SCP articles which were under 30 and tales which were under 20 when this edition of site news was posted. Give them a little love! Speaking from personal experience, the most frustrating thing that can happen to an article is not deletion, but stagnating below 20 without any comments. So try to read, vote, and comment on these articles! They&#39;re often hidden gems :)

+++ Editorials&#39; Picks

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Click to Reveal!&#34; hide=&#34;- Click to Close&#34;]]
++++* Uncle Nicolini

T Rutherford has had a very strong premiere as a new author. I highly recommend reading their work, which is available [[[t-rutherford-author-page|here.]]] Keep an eye on them heading into 2020!

Woedenaz has developed a tasteful collection of themes that use impressive CSS and design skills. They are viewable [[[/woedenaz/offset/1|here.]]]

And last but not least, here is my favorite art piece from last year:

= [[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-952/HighwayAsh.png style=&#34;width:50%&#34;]]
Made by Woedenaz for uraniumempire for the 2019 Art Exchange. It&#39;s a beautiful rendition of the album in Uranium&#39;s [[[SCP-952]]]!
-----
++++* UraniumEmpire

Tsercele started off with [[[SCP-4581]]] and hit the g-ddamn ground running! Keep an eye on their hit series, [[[The Eternal MxTape]]].

The best skip of the year, in my humble opinion, was [[[SCP-4504]]]. If you&#39;ve got some time, give it a read!
-----
++++* TheMightyMcB
kybard showed up out of the blue and just started kicking ass and taking names! Be sure to check him out at [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/kybard|his author page]]] and read all three of his skips, because they&#39;re excellent.

One of my favorite skips from 2019, and one that I find to be massively underrated, was [[[SCP-3638]]] &#34;You Can&#39;t Be Serious!&#34;, by 440 Hertz. It even has a really fun collaborative art page!
-----
++++* gee0765

I recommend [[[SCP-4338]]], [[[SCP-3272]]], [[[SCP-4368]]], and [[[SCP-4357]]].

My favorite breakout author of the year was none other than T Rutherford!
-----
++++* Vincent Van Gone

My favorite SCP of the year was [[[SCP-4390]]], and Tanhony really popped off this year!
-----
++++* Croquembouche

I highly recommend you check out the End of Death subseries, [[[the-existential-maw-of-despair-national-park|Lookout 281.]]]
-----
++++* A Random Day

MUCKSCAPE/MEGAGRID/MAYHEM series (http://www.scp-wiki.net/muckscape-megagrid-mayhem-hub); Maim The Sky, Slay the Sun series (http://www.scp-wiki.net/maim-the-sky-slay-the-sun-hub) are my picks.

There was exactly one author i can remember who wrote good-ass shit last year and his name is pedantique.
-----
++++* MalyceGraves

[[[SCP-4140]]], [[[Breakneck]]], [[[SCP-4840]]], [[[SCP-4372]]] and the new author Hatcheye are my picks.
-----
++++* Elenee FishTruck

Some great content got made for the International Group of Interest competition! I&#39;d recommend you all check out the [[[sky-sermon-hub|Sky Sermon series]]], [[[non-prophet-organization-hub|A Non-Prophet Organization series]]], and [[[SCP-4775]]] and [[[SCP-4642]]] for the Meat Circus GoI!

My pick for best new author is [[[oricat-author-page|OriCat]]]. Go read some of their tales, especially, their Daevite-centric ones.
-----
++++* Roget

[[[adoption-poster-darius| Mr. DARE]]] is the best thing produced on the SCP Wiki in 2019. Try to prove me wrong. You can’t. It’s wickedly funny and made Wilson’s go from a group I had a positive opinion of to a favorite.

+* Q&amp;A:

++* Q: Can I replace a blurb that you wrote for one of my articles with my own? I&#39;m not satisfied with it.

A: Absolutely. You will always have that option at any point.

++* Q: I noticed an error/typo/incorrect information and wish to correct it. May I?

A: Sure! If the changes are not limited to your own article(s) and/or are substantial changes across multiple entries, you should post in that month&#39;s discussion page and then make the changes.

++* Q: I wrote an article and it seems to have stuck. Can I send a blurb of mine to one of the frequent collaborators?

A: Yup! It&#39;s much easier if you come to us about it, and it gives you the control over what you want shown on the news page.
