**Transcript generated by TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic**

&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Alright, recorder‚Äôs up. Uh, I‚Äôm back inside the cabinet, in the room with the slime. This time, I have a light. Also, I figured out how to install TSAT into an audio recorder, so, say hi, TSAT.
&gt; 
&gt; **TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic:** üëã Hello! üëã
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Anyways, now I can see in the dark. I was right, it‚Äôs a metal room, around 20 feet by 20 feet. Walls are made of rusty gray metal, looks like they‚Äôre bolted together, can‚Äôt tell how long they‚Äôve been around.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I‚Äôm standing in some weird yellow slime. Heaven knows what it is, but I‚Äôm glad I brought rain boots.
&gt; 
&gt; **TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic:** üìù Note: üìù If you scream at the slime, I can analyze the soundwaves that bounce off of it, and use my vast database of audio analysis knowledge to get a general idea of its composition.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Huh. If you say so...
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Researcher Dylan screaming at the slime.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic:** üîé Estimated Analysis ‚Äî üëÑ {{50}}% human saliva, üíß {{30}}% non-anomalous water, ‚ùì {{20}}% unknown biological solution.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Thanks. Uh, should probably avoid the slime, then...
&gt; 
&gt; Anyways, there was a door in the wall, that I missed. I&#39;m gonna open it. Rusty handle, looks like it hasn&#39;t been opened in forever. Opening in 3... 2... 1...
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Creak from opening rusty door, followed by humming from Researcher Dylan.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** There‚Äôs a hallway here. Less dirty than the room, but it still smells like a swamp. The slime isn‚Äôt on the floor like it was in the last room.
&gt; 
&gt; There‚Äôs four doors, not counting the one I came through. They all have symbols carved into them. First one to the left has a crescent, like a moon. Second one has a square. First to the right has a circle. Last one has a weird shape; &#34;blob&#34; is the best way I can describe it.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Rusty creaking from Researcher Dylan closing the door.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Weird. The door I came in from has the Shield on it. The logo, the thing we put on all of our reports. The circle with the arrows. That‚Äôs engraved into the door.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Pause.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Eenie meenie minie moe... I guess I‚Äôll choose the moon door. 
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Creaking from opening the door, followed by a gasp from Researcher Dylan.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Alright, there&#39;s sunlight out here...
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Clicking of the flashlight turning off, followed by footsteps from Researcher Dylan walking through the door.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** The door lead to a valley, or a canyon. Don&#39;t know the proper term. Um, it&#39;s dirt, and the walls are too tall for me to climb. The swamp smell is still here, but it&#39;s died down. Smells like Freon now, if anything.
&gt; 
&gt; There&#39;s some weird stuff up above, going over the valley. Reminds me a bit of green Silly String, it&#39;s draped over the canyon for as far as I can see. It&#39;s way thicker than Silly String, though; looks like I could crawl through it, if it was hollow.
&gt; 
&gt; The door I came through&#39;s embedded in the side of the valley. There&#39;s no moon on this side, just a rusty iron door. Looks almost like a mirage, now that I think about it. Looks like I could stick my hand through it.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Pause.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; No, it&#39;s metal. //&lt;Pause.&gt;// I guess I&#39;ll walk along the canyon&#39;s walls.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Footsteps from Researcher Dylan walking down the valley.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: ‚ö†Ô∏è Analysis of breathing pattern complete, it is estimated that there is less oxygen in the atmosphere than on Earth. It is recommended that you avoid strenuous, aerobic activities.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Good to know. Definitely won&#39;t be able to climb the cliff, then.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Researcher Dylan takes approximately 15 steps forwards without comment. He goes around a corner during this time.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** It&#39;s a house. Two stories, gray, looks old as crap. Some of the string stuff from up above is connected to the house. Sorta like a spider web.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Footsteps, followed by a grunt from Researcher Dylan, then silence.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** I just threw a rock at one of the strings connected to the house. It&#39;s elastic, like a guitar string. Make a little &#34;pwang&#34; sound too.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Footsteps, followed by the sound of Researcher Dylan opening the door to the house.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Inside of the house looks like the out. Everything&#39;s tattered, like a herd o&#39; dogs came through here. The green stuff from outside is in here too. Smells a lot more like Freon. There&#39;s a flat screen TV with a Samsung logo. If this is another planet or an alternate dimension, like TSAT said, they have the same brands as us.
&gt; 
&gt; **TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic:** ‚ùì I never stated that this area is either an exoplanet or a parallel timeline.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** What about the atmosphere stuff that you said?
&gt; 
&gt; **TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic:** üå¨Ô∏è It is possible, although unlikely, that we could be at a high altitude, or equivalent in this area. With more complex equipment, I could conduct further analysis and determine deviation, if any, from baseline Earth for a more accurate measurement.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Noted. Uh, I&#39;m gonna avoid the green shit. Looks sticky.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Pause.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; There isn&#39;t much here, other than the silly string and some old furniture. I&#39;ll head upstairs.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Wooden footsteps from Researcher Dylan going up a set of stairs, followed by the sound of a door opening.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Shit. There‚Äôs a skeleton in here, on the bed. It still has a bit of flesh on it, must be somewhat recent. Scared me a bit. Sorry, uh, this is a bedroom. There‚Äôs a lampstand with a book on it. Says &#34;Diary&#34; on the front.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Researcher Dylan picks up the book. Sound of pages turning follows.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Alright, here‚Äôs the last entry. &#34;September 18th, 2018.&#34; This is definitely recent. Let‚Äôs read it.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &#34;It‚Äôs been a long time, but I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôm probably boned now. I‚Äôve been bedridden for days, and my vision is turning red, just like Maurice. I don‚Äôt know if I caught it from Maurice or one of the kids, but in any case this is probably the end of me.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &#34;I shot a firework up a half hour or so ago. If the beasts didn‚Äôt already know where I am, they do now. My gun‚Äôs already out of bullets, and there‚Äôs no chance of me getting up to find a weapon to impale myself with. I guess I‚Äôll just go with getting eaten.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &#34;I heard one of them roar. I just hope that they don‚Äôt make a mess of the place.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Uh, about your place, buddy. Alright, some shit definitely went down here. He said &#34;caught&#34;, maybe something about a disease? I‚Äôll go back a few entries, see if I see anything.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &#34;September 6th, 2018&#34;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I had to put down Shauna today.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; She came up to me with the sniffles and said that her vision was turning red, like Theo‚Äôs was. I took her outside and told her to look at the pretty flowers. Then I shot her in the back of the head.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Maurice saw me do it but she didn‚Äôt stop me. The last thing we want is‚Äî
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Researcher Dylan is interrupted by a loud, high-pitched roar in the distance.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** What was that? Fuck. I should get out of here.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Footsteps from Researcher Dylan descending the stairs, followed by creaking from opening the door. Similar roars can be heard rapidly approaching Researcher Dylan. Heavy breathing from Researcher Dylan jogging.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;After a period of jogging, the roar from before is heard, but distinctly closer. Gasp from Researcher Dylan.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** It&#39;s right above me!
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Sounds of Researcher Dylan running, as well as stepping and screeching from the creature. After a chase, Researcher Dylan slams the door he came from shut. He then takes some time to recover.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** //&lt;Exhausted&gt;// It... I got away, but it...
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Creaking from the door opening, then shutting.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** ...still out there, I think it&#39;s patrolling... looked a bit like a giant lizard, neon green, big, big teeth, spikes... the worst part was... the worst part.. human... human face, all stretched out, over its reptile head... terrifying.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Researcher Dylan spends some more time recovering.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** I think that&#39;s all... TSAT, what time is it?
&gt; 
&gt; **TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic:** ‚è∞ The current time is {{2203}} hours, or {{10:03}} PM.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Dylan:** Jesus Christ, I&#39;m beat. I need a rest.
