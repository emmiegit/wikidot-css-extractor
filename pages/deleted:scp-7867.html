Any personnel wanting to enter SCP-7867s containment cell must pass an exam to prove they are mentally stable. If food is brought near SCP-7867’s containment cell it must be taken away and the area to be evacuated for three days.

**Description:** SCP-7867 is a dark gray humanoid with no distinct features but a black X where the cross of the X on center of SCP-7867’s eyes should be. SCP-7867 has a mouth that doesn&#39;t exist till opened, so it can’t be forcefully opened. SCP-7867’s mouth appears to be as black a void with human type teeth. SCP-7867 is seen and tested to be mentally unstable and shows symptoms of heavy bipolar with a type of depression and violence as the most common. SCP-7867 can’t receive or produce any chemical that causes happiness of any kind. SCP-7867 can produce any product of self-harm from its back that has the same shade of gray as SCP-7867. These tools produced by SCP-7867 can not harm SCP-7867 in any way but can harm anything else. If anyone or thing attempts to pick up the tools from SCP-7867 it would disappear like it never existed. If SCP-7867 is to eat any other source of energy than steak, SCP-7867 would go into a process over the course of 3 (three) days. The first day SCP-7867 will crawl into a ball and weep, the second day SCP-7867 will become aggressive and violent to anyone and thing, on the third day he will either [[span style=&#34;background-color:black;&#34;]]##black|Stop Peeking##[[/span]] or die.

**Discovery Log (18-1-[[span style=&#34;background-color:black;&#34;]]##black|Hi##[[/span]]
)** SCP-7867 was found in an apartment with a mutilated tenant. SCP-7867 was attempting to hang itself with one of his gray nooses. As SCP-7867 fell, the rope seemed to go through its neck so SCP-7867 kept walking up the step stool, and trying again. It was estimated this had been going on for at least 6 hours.

**Addendum-7867-1:** D-class #[[span style=&#34;background-color:black;&#34;]]##black|69420##[[/span]] was assigned to clean SCP-7867’s containment cell walls. The day before, Dr.[[span style=&#34;background-color:black;&#34;]]##black|Hello:]##[[/span]]  Gave SCP-7867 a bite of a granola bar. SCP-7867 was going through its three-day phase, and ripped off the limbs of the D-class. SCP-7867 then ripped off the containment cell door, resulting in a containment breach that was not resolved till the next day where it was found [[span style=&#34;background-color:black;&#34;]]##black|Stop Peaking##[[/span]]

**Addendum-7867-2:** On 11-5-22, SCP-999 was introduced to SCP-7867 to experiment. When SCP-999 saw SCP-7867, SCP-999 went to SCP-7867 and tried to start a tickle fight. SCP-7867 did not react, staying in the same spot and position, SCP-999 didn’t give up. Soon enough, it gave up and started crying, SCP-999 was then promptly removed from SCP-7867’s containment cell.
