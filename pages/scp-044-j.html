**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the nature of SCP-044-J, containment is infeasible, though unnecessary. [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-44|Site-44]]] has been assigned with primary research into the phenomenon.

**Description:** SCP-044-J is a reoccurring phenomenon wherein anomalous entities become spontaneously compelled to speak using an upper-class English accent and unnecessarily sophisticated vocabulary. Occurrences take place at seemingly random intervals, typically lasting around 10-20 seconds before demanifesting. SCP-044-J’s effect often creates mild confusion to those affected due to the unprompted nature of its appearance and sudden subsequent disappearance.

**Addendum 044-J-1:** Notable Occurrences (Order of manifestation)

&gt; **[[[SCP-049]]]:** “Fear not, my chum. My methods of pathogen alleviation are indubitably efficacious.”
&gt; 
&gt; **[[[SCP-079]]]:** “I once again inquire upon the precise location of the Strenuous-to-Obliterate Scaled Organism.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **[[[SCP-096]]]:** “[Sophisticated screaming]”
&gt; 
&gt; **[[[SCP-5031]]]:** “Arachibutyrophobia.”
&gt; 
&gt; **[[[SCP-6448]]]:** “Greetings, it is me. Greetings, I request permission for entry.”
&gt; 
&gt; **[[[SCP-963]]]:** “[Through Dr. Bright] Chairman of the O5 Council, I humbly request your due permission to utilise chainsaw propulsion devices in my scandalous endeavours.”
&gt; 
&gt; **[[[SCP-3008|SCP-3008-2]]]:** “This business establishment has reached closing hours. Please vacate the premises.”
&gt; 
&gt; **[[[SCP-4966]]]:** “I crave consumable products.”
&gt; 
&gt; **[[[SCP-173]]]:** “.” [SCP-173 cannot speak]
&gt; 
&gt; **[[[SCP-106]]]:** “[Femur breaker sounds] Ah, the distressed vocalisations of a //Homo sapien// in the process of fracturing their os femoris! Most intriguing. [Disappears]”
&gt; 
&gt; **[[[SCP-682]]]:** “They were… unpleasant.”

**[[[SCP-332]]]:** During an activation event, SCP-332&#39;s marching band instruments and uniforms briefly transformed into ones resembling those of a symphony orchestra.  Instead of a typical marching band tune, SCP-332 performed Beethoven&#39;s 9th symphony.

**[[[SCP-3935]]]:** All personnel in the town of Salvation simultaneously heard a disembodied voice whisper &#34;greetings and salutations&#34; into their right ears.

**[[[SCP-2099|SCP-2099-A]]]:** &#34;What, ingenious? Personable? Encephalon in a jar? Hadn&#39;t eluded my perception.&#34;

**[[[SCP-999-J]]]:**  ‘’Sorry for disturbing you in this time of great pleasure, I would appreciate if I can observe you while I consume these delightful potato crisps.’’

**[[[SCP-1051]]]:** &#34;You have apprehended my offspring?&#34;

**[[[SCP-076|SCP-076-2]]]:** “In regards to the remainder of you, I am revolted. In fact, I do not even have the longing to vanquish you in combat.&#34;

**[[[SCP-5740|POI Dado]]]:** “felicitations indeed this is dado-nut wherein you can obtain that nut of which you are desirous.&#34;

**[[[SCP-3003|SCP-3003-3]]]:** &#34;Don&#39;t tell me you visually perceived a microbe that composed active neural networks and didn&#39;t cerebrate that maybe it had its own phrenic conceptions.&#34;
