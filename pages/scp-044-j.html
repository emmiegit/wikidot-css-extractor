**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the nature of SCP-044-J, containment is infeasible, though unnecessary. [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-44|Site-44]]] has been assigned with primary research into the phenomenon.

**Description:** SCP-044-J is a reoccurring phenomenon wherein anomalous entities become spontaneously compelled to speak using an upper-class English accent and unnecessarily sophisticated vocabulary. Occurrences take place at seemingly random intervals, typically lasting around 10-20 seconds before demanifesting. SCP-044-J’s effect often creates mild confusion to those affected due to the unprompted nature of its appearance and sudden subsequent disappearance.

**Addendum 044-J-1:** Notable Occurrences (Order of manifestation)

&gt; **[[[SCP-049]]]:** “Fear not, my chum. My methods of pathogen alleviation are indubitably efficacious.”

&gt; 
&gt; **[[[SCP-096]]]:** “[Sophisticated screaming]”

&gt; **[[[SCP-5031]]]:** “Arachibutyrophobia.”

&gt;

**[[[SCP-332]]]:** During an activation event, SCP-332&#39;s marching band instruments and uniforms briefly transformed into ones resembling those of a symphony orchestra.  Instead of a typical marching band tune, SCP-332 performed Beethoven&#39;s 9th symphony.

**[[[SCP-3935]]]:** All personnel in the town of Salvation simultaneously heard a disembodied voice whisper &#34;greetings and salutations&#34; into their right ears.

**[[[SCP-999-J]]]:**  ‘’Sorry for disturbing you in this time of great pleasure, I would appreciate if I can observe you while I consume these delightful potato crisps.’’

**[[[SCP-1051]]]:** &#34;You have apprehended my offspring?&#34;

**[[[SCP-076|SCP-076-2]]]:** “In regards to the remainder of you, I am revolted. In fact, I do not even have the longing to vanquish you in combat.&#34;
