I looked up through my window at the inverted horizon of Three Portlands, phone to my ear. &#34;It&#39;s just... I&#39;ve been here a while, and...&#34;

&#34;A while? It&#39;s been, what, a few days?!&#34; Boss answered. &#34;I get that you like traveling, but I&#39;m putting a lot of resources into you. You&#39;ve gotta squeeze all you can outta Three Ports!&#34; Usually he would&#39;ve been screaming, but I guess my food reviews had been gaining traction in the Peculiar Post. Good reception equals more money for him, after all.

&#34;It&#39;s boring, okay? I just wanna move on, you know? I already went to the bakery, so I think that&#39;s enough. You understand, right?&#34;

&#34;I do not--&#34; Cutting himself off with a loud sigh, he lowered his voice, probably trying not to get annoyed with me. &#34;One more place before you leave, okay? I know the perfect restaurant.&#34;

As if on cue, my stomach rumbled. &#34;I suppose I shouldn&#39;t go through a Way on an empty stomach...&#34;

&#34;Perfect! I&#39;ll send over the details now.&#34;

------

&#34;Thank you for joining us on this fine night, Mr. Morrison,&#34; the waiter said. &#34;Your table is here, the meal will be out shortly. Let me know if you need anything.&#34; 

The Homestead looked like a regular &#39;fancy&#39; restaurant. White tablecloths, little candelabras on every table, and generally dim, comfortable lighting... but wafting through the air was a sweet smell, like that of a melted marshmallow. 

As I took my seat, I scanned the room to see overjoyed faces-- one girl was even crying, rapidly shoving forkfuls of pancake into her mouth. Honestly, I can relate sometimes. But being able to pry raw emotion out of oneself is not something a lot of food can do. Usually--

&#34;Your food.&#34; The waiter placed a plate of... 

&#34;What is this?&#34; I asked, pointing down at the tannish-brown mush on my plate. 

They gulped. &#34;It&#39;s what the cook made for you.&#34; 

I pointed at the girl across the restaurant, who was still inhaling her pancakes. &#34;Why&#39;d she get pancakes? Mine looks like a lump of... tar, or something.&#34;

&#34;T- that&#39;s what the chef made for her.&#34; Something was clearly wrong.

&#34;Okay...&#34; Not wanting to waste any time, I picked up my spoon, scooped a bit of my &#39;food&#39; up, and shoved it into my mouth. I swallowed hesitantly. &#34;This is... Hmm.&#34;

&#34;Yes?&#34; The waiter asked, clasping their hands together expectantly.

&#34;Uhhh, it&#39;s... bland. Like... like a microwave dinner.&#34;

The look on their face was a mix of fear and confusion. 

&#34;...what&#39;s it //supposed// to be?&#34;

They took a moment before stumbling out a response. &#34;It&#39;s supposed to taste like a homecooked meal...&#34;

Oh. 

&#34;This place isn&#39;t for me,&#34; I muttered, sitting up as the waiter mustered out several lengthy apologies, &#34;I just... it&#39;s okay.&#34;

Using magic to make food taste homecooked. What a brilliant idea...

My throat tightened as I left The Homestead, barely remembering to shove a twenty-dollar bill into the waiter&#39;s hands. 

------

Reviewing something when I am not the intended audience does not leave a good taste in my mouth. I didn&#39;t experience the meal how it was //supposed// to be experienced-- of course it wasn&#39;t going to be good! So I sat down in the lobby of my hotel, called Boss, and told him just that.

His reply was... not happy. &#34;Come on, you should be able to get //something// out!&#34;

&#34;I just said it wouldn&#39;t feel right.&#34;

&#34;Does it have to?&#34;

I paused for a moment. &#34;I think you know what I&#39;m going to answer.&#34;

&#34;Listen, Morrison. Your job is to be //entertaining// or //informative//. This should be easy for you! Just, like, write a bad review for once--&#34;

&#34;No,&#34; I interrupted. &#34;It wasn&#39;t a //bad// restaurant. I saw someone bought to //tears// by their food, do you know how hard that is to do?&#34;

&#34;No, but... fine, then write about whoever //is// the intended audience. &#39;I personally did not like the food, but do not let that dissuade you.&#39; There, already got the start of it done for you.&#34;

I sat back in my chair, staring at the hotel ceiling. &#34;Fine. Check your email in an hour, I&#39;ll whip something up.&#34;

&#34;Thank you,&#34; Boss said, hanging up.

I let out a sigh. Standing up, a small globe on the dresser caught my eye, and I suddenly got an excellent idea. I walked over and gave it a spin before poking it with my finger, bringing it to a halting stop. For my next destination, I would be going to...

//Maybe I should respin.//

//...should I?//

//I mean, I bet I can find// something //out there...//

//You know what? Why not?//

I flipped open my laptop and stretched for a moment before typing out something Boss was likely going to be angry at me for, and praying that all the ad revenue we&#39;ve been getting from my reviews so far would make up it.

**Food In The Anomalous Community** by Edwin Morrison
//Volume 3//
[[/div]]
Last volume, I reviewed Paraweiser Pastries, a little pastry shop in the middle of Three Portlands. Well, this volume is going to be a bit different.

Overall, the food scene of Three Portlands is incredibly impressive, and with thaumaturgy everywhere, it&#39;s quite magical as well. From a restaurant with the ability to make a homecooked meal from your childhood to a cart always offering the best comfort food, many establishments didn&#39;t even have a menu! 

------

As a whole, I give the city of Three Portlands a 10/10. Just make sure to research wherever you&#39;re going first, otherwise your experience may not be the best. 

Now, my next destination-- as chosen by the spin of a globe-- will be the Pacific Ocean!

Miles away, at the Peculiar Post, Boss sat back in his chair with a grumble. &#34;I really shouldn&#39;t let him get away with this...&#34;
