**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6047 is kept contained in a Standard Biological Entity Containment Unit, located at Site-300-14. SCP-6047 appears to enjoy the activity of play with personnel and daily interactions with the entity have been approved.

Following the events detailed in Addendum 6047.2, no males are to interact with SCP-6047 and all handling duties must be performed by female personnel. The SCP-6047-A instances do not need to be handled by staff.
 
**Description:** SCP-6047 is the disembodied right hand belonging to the late Jacqueline Walzer. It is severed at the wrist and the stump itself is covered with skin. SCP-6047 is animate through unknown means and is aware of its surroundings despite the lack of visual organs. It is capable of using its fingers for locomotion and for other tasks.

SCP-6047-A are smaller instances functioning similarly to SCP-6047. However, they appear less capable.

**Discovery:** SCP-6047 came to the Foundation&#39;s attention following an investigation into the disappearance of Lucas and Jacqueline Walzer, a married couple. Local authorities entered their residence and discovered the corpses of both individuals in the basement.

Mrs Walzer was notably missing her right hand. Foundation personnel took over the investigation following the discovery of several texts and materials relating to thaumaturgical practices as well as reports from police referring to a &#34;walking hand scuttling around&#34; at the site. The anomaly was recovered and the relevant amnestication protocols were followed.

An examination by Foundation thaumatologists revealed that the document had been embedded with an infohazard causing viewers to believe that they are viewing a text pertaining to a subject of their desire in thaumatology.[[footnote]] It was found that most information presented by the infohazard was usually faulty in nature. [[/footnote]] Following rigorous perceptive filtering, it was found that the documents were completely blank.
 
**Addendum 6047.1:** The following are the latest entries from Jacqueline Walzer&#39;s recovered journal.

The entire house is cold. It&#39;s almost like ice.

Course Luke doesn&#39;t mind. He never does, just the kind of person he is. Always steadfast when it came down to it. Never wavering, ever dedicated to a task. Wish I were more like him but you know. He’s been rummaging so much in the kitchen I don&#39;t think there&#39;s even a scrap left. He brought some papers yesterday, a whole bunch of them, all old looking and worn. Didn’t tell me where he got them from, but it may have been from those [[[serpent-s-hand-hub|fellows]]] that he’s been getting acquainted recently with. Anyway, he’s been rumbling down in the basement since last night, without any sleep.
@@ @@
I think this is all related to us not being able to have kids. We&#39;ve always wanted them. Ain’t Life cruel? I wish I could beat it into submission, ruining everything there is in our sights. It’s fate, existence. And there’s nothing we can ever do. I will resent and hate it, always.
@@ @@
 I’m just a weight on Luke&#39;s shoulders, and I know I can&#39;t convince him to stop.
@@ @@
Will it work? I don’t want to doubt him, but… he&#39;s no master magician.
@@ @@
Don’t get in trouble Luke. Let’s just do with what we have, don’t get in trouble…

Luke looks so happy. He came out of the basement. He’s smiling like he never has before. It’s the first time it looked so genuine, ever since the day we realised. He kissed me. Said that it will work. That we won’t be alone ever again. He just went back down, told me to come down when he called.
@@ @@
I don&#39;t know what to think.

[[div class=&#34;addendum&#34;]]
I want to have kids. Raise them and be proud of who they become. Know that they’ll watch me when I’m passing and remember me when I’m part of the Earth. Just like Mama once did to me.
@@ @@
I trust Luke. I trust him completely. I love him, and he loves me. I can&#39;t doubt him. I never will. After everything he did, how could I? Destroy all shreds of doubt, believe in him completely.
@@ @@
I feel so happy right now.
@@ @@
What will I name them? I think I’ll name the boy Jack. What about a girl, hm... I&#39;ll name the girl Sarah. Or Riley, yes

My Mama, I&#39;ll be just like her one day, kind and caring.

He&#39;s calling me.

Our hands will be together, always.

**Addendum 6047.2 (INCIDENT REPORT):** A week after initial containment, Dr Matthew Chen, who had been responsible for the care of SCP-6047, entered SCP-6047’s Containment Unit to find it unusually erratic and affectionate compared to its usual behaviour. SCP-6047 clasped tightly onto Dr Chen’s left hand. Several minutes later, arriving security personnel aided Dr Chen in dislodging SCP-6047. Dr Chen was later sent to the medical bay following the incident for an analysis, which uncovered no abnormalities with Dr Chen.

Throughout the next 9 hours, a growth similar to a cyst began expanding across the palm of SCP-6047 and it grew sluggish compared to its usual nature. The growth’s inflation concerned researchers assigned to the anomaly and an emergency procedure was planned to analyse the cause. However, prior to the procedure, researchers noted movement within the sac. Several minutes later, SCP-6047 started to convulse before its growth broke and expelled its contents. A liquid identified to be amniotic fluid and two hands, dismembered roughly at the same area as SCP-6047, were recovered.

The instances resembled the hands of newborn human infants and both were identified to be biologically female. After an autosomal DNA test, it was found that Dr Chen was the biological father of the instances. These were labelled as SCP-6047-A instances and SCP-6047&#39;s containment procedures have been updated. They are kept in the same Unit as SCP-6047 and it has been observed to tend to them.
