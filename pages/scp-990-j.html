**Item #:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-990 SCP-990]-J

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Currently no containment measures for SCP-990-J have been devised, and, due to //extensive// budget cuts, we can no longer keep paying personnel to come up with ideas. All suggestions are welcome,[[footnote]] See the suggestion bucket in the Site-19 atrium if you would like to recommend containment measures for SCP-990-J.[[/footnote]] however, do not expect any sort of raise or recognition for your efforts.

Also, this may not be the best place to put this but, while we&#39;re on the subject of money, we&#39;re going to have to limit everyone in Site-19 to __**two cups of coffee per day**__. [[[SCP-294]]] refuses to comply with personnel requests for liquids of any kind,[[footnote]]Ever since //the incident//.[[/footnote]] and you seriously do not realize how much we spend per quarter on Folgers alone. It&#39;s appalling.[[footnote]] And now that I&#39;m running the numbers, I can see that it would be cheaper in the long run to replace Folgers&#39; entire employee roster with D-Class personnel. --Wait, can we do that?-- [[/footnote]]

**Description:** SCP-990-J is the designation for a human male dressed in Tommy Bahama-brand clothing that appears to Foundation personnel through dreams.[[footnote]] SCP-990-J claims it can and does appear to others but remarks that his interactions are often forgotten by non-Foundation staff. This is likely due to the now-mandatory Class-W Mnestic regimen of all personnel causing an increased retention of dream detail, and definitely, //definitely// nothing to do with the long-standing Foundation initiative to earn a little extra cash by having D-Class apply for anomalous job classifieds. Absolutely not because of that second thing. 
 - RAISA[[/footnote]] So far, no Foundation personnel have encountered SCP-990-J in the real world; if he corresponds to an actual human being, we have yet to find him, and because of the aforementioned budget cuts, we probably //won&#39;t// find him.

Although SCP-990-J has been appearing to Foundation personnel since 1993,[[footnote]]Coincidentally, the same year the Tommy Bahama Group, Inc. was founded. Research into SCP-990-J as an oneirological thoughtform is not underway, and neither are investigations into Tommy Bahama itself as a potential group of interest. Himself? Is Tommy Bahama an actual person?[[/footnote]][[footnote]] I just googled it and he is not an actual person. What a waste of time and resources--//like this document amirite?//--[[/footnote]] his existence as an anomalous entity did not come to light until 2004, when the Foundation Human Resources Department responded to the original tickets submitted a decade prior. The entity did not receive official classification until the events of Incident 990-1.

**Incident Log 990-1:**

&gt;  Edward J. ██████, a Level I Junior Research Technician working in the Site-19 anomalous entity intake ward, reportedly failed to clock out for his unpaid lunch on 10/21/2005, leading to a formal audit the following day. 
&gt; 
&gt; Camera footage of ██████ revealed he had fallen asleep during this period, yet did not appear to possess any knowledge of having done so. ██████ insisted that he had spent that time processing the intake of an entity, going on to transcribe his conversation with SCP-990-J for use as evidence in the audit. --Following the conclusion of said audit, this transcript should be available below for personnel to read.-- ,,**UPDATE 10/23/2005:** As per majority vote of the O5 council, ██████ will be allowed to retain his wages for time spent asleep, on the grounds that he was under the influence of anomalous phenomena at the time.^^--Way to go, Eddy! Fight the system!--^^,,
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; = {{Transcript 990-1}}
&gt; 
&gt; ██████: Okay, so, welcome to Site-19. My name is Edward, I&#39;m a Junior Technician here, and my job right now is to get your basic information and to answer any questions you might have about the process of transitioning into long-term living at 19.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-990-J:** Oh, so like an interview?
&gt; 
&gt; ██████: Yeah, more or less.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-990-J:** Cool, cool, sounds good to me.
&gt; 
&gt; ██████: Alright, please state your name.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-990-J:** Uhhh, what about Bobby? 
&gt; 
&gt; ██████: Bobby? Is that your name?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-990-J:** Yeah. No, wait, how about Phil? Is Phil taken?
&gt; 
&gt; ██████: Taken? That&#39;s not how names work-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-990-J:** You&#39;re right, Bobby is better, can I go back to Bobby? 
&gt; 
&gt; ██████: Bobby it is, then.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-990-J:** You know what, you&#39;re gonna hate me but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m feeling Bobby anymore. I said it over and over and now it doesn&#39;t sound like a real name. Bobby. Bob-by. Just pick something for me, I&#39;m indecisive.
&gt; 
&gt; ██████: I literally can&#39;t progress to the next page until I put something in the field for &#34;name&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; ██████: I&#39;m going to put &#34;Tommy Bahama&#34; because of your shirt.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-990-J:** [laughs for an objectively uncomfortable amount of time]
&gt; 
&gt; ██████: It really wasn&#39;t that funny.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-990-J:** Actually, while I have you here, can I talk to you about something? It&#39;s important.
&gt; 
&gt; ██████: Uh, sure?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-990-J:** Great, great. So listen, buddy. Last year I made eighteen hundred dollars a week working from the comfort of my own home. Isn&#39;t financial independence the best?
&gt; 
&gt; ██████: Y-Yeah, I mean, I guess so.[[footnote]] It is to note that ██████ currently lives on the Site-19 campus and receives reduced pay in exchange for room and board.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-990-J:** Anyway,  you seem like a smart guy, and I like that, so I&#39;m gonna let you in on a little secret. You can also be making this kind of cash, man. You can have two cars and a mansion too baby. You just gotta invest in your future. Invest, in- //Herbalife//.
&gt; 
&gt; ██████: [laughs nervously] 
&gt;   
&gt; //SCP-990-J retrieves a case of supplements and a binder from under the table.// 
&gt; 
&gt; ██████: -oh, shit, you&#39;re serious. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-990-J:** I am so serious, Ethan.
&gt; 
&gt;  ██████: It&#39;s Edwa-
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-990-J:** I am so very serious about giving you the opportunities you&#39;ve only dreamed of. Now, I&#39;m a straight shooter, you&#39;re a straight shooter, let&#39;s get down to brass tacks, I want you to be my prime VIP downline distributor, can I sign you up for the welcome package or what?
&gt; 
&gt;  ██████: Uhhh....
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-990-J opens the binder in presentation to ██████.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-990-J:** See, for every distributor you sign up, you get a portion of their earnings and their signed-up distributors&#39; earnings and so forth. There is literally no limit to the cash you can make!
&gt; 
&gt;  ██████: This is a pyramid scheme.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-990-J:** A what now?
&gt; 
&gt; ██████: A pyramid scheme. You know, guy at the top gets the big cheese, the lesser guys make money based on the number of people you recruit under you. I don&#39;t even know what your product is. What does it do?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-990-J:** //Herbalife// is a, ahem, //a proprietary blend of antioxidants, enzymes and essential vitamins specifically designed to rid the body of toxins and-//
&gt; 
&gt; ██████: I can see you reading off the label. You don&#39;t know anything about the products you sell, do you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-990-J:** It&#39;s organic. It&#39;s full of organics.
&gt; 
&gt; ██████: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-990-J:**[[footnote]] There was more to this conversation, but the transcriptionist assigned to copying the interview into digital storage was laid off. Essentially, SCP-990-J continued to pitch //Herbalife// for several minutes, despite ██████&#39;s obvious growing discomfort of the situation. ██████ tried to push through by bringing out some the Site-19 residency contracts, the legalese of which SCP-990-J found highly distressing and &#34;very airtight&#34;. SCP-990-J reportedly produced a smoke bomb from an unknown location, and quickly threw it at the ground, causing the room to fill with smoke, with ██████ waking up shortly thereafter.[[/footnote]]

**Addendum 990-J-A:** Due to a sharp increase in sightings of SCP-990-J in dreams of personnel with sub-optimal credit scores,[[footnote]] //Wow//, a lot of you guys are wildly in debt. And no, we are not processing insurance claims at the moment, why do you ask?[[/footnote]] Site-19 has been retrofitted with several thousand REM-inhibiting Waveform Generators. As of 05/12/2016, SCP-990-J encounters have been successfully reduced by 99%.

**Incident Log 990-2:**

On 06/04/2016, O5-1 discovered a handwritten note taped to his forehead, as a well as eleven tubs of //Herbalife// Formula 1 Advanced Nutritional Shake Mix, three cases of //Herbalife// Formula 2 Multivitamins and seventeen packages of //Herbalife// Simply Probiotic and Active Fiber Complex when he awoke in his quarters. The note reads as follows:

&gt; //Hey there, killer!//
&gt; 
&gt; //Just got you set up with our deluxe package. I&#39;ll check back in with you in a week to get an update on your sales. Remember, always start with a smile!//
&gt; 
&gt; //-tb//

O5-1 has denied having any interactions with SCP-990-J.


//Absolutely preposterous. Now, how would you like to be your own boss?// - O5-1
