“Darling?”

I blink, eyes still hazed and head still pounding from the previous night. There are shapes moving around in front of me, but nothing terribly interesting seizes my attention. Rolling over, I sweep my blanket past my shoulder, wipe some dried chunks off my chin.

A hand violently shakes my shoulder. I slap it away, grunting. I say something like,

“Don’t bother me none, baby. Don’t do that.”

An angry voice begins shouting, but before I can listen, a hard leather mass lodges itself in my spine. I leap up, scrambling away from the dull and already fading pain. I yank my boxers from around my ankles, and leap up ahead

I see two smears shimmering in what I know is my room. One’s a black, the other a yellow one. The black one, who’s a lot bigger than me or her, or both, grabs me, and the voice begins shouting again.

I feel his breath on my nose. It stinks.

As he violently shakes my body, I can’t help but wonder what might’ve caused me to end up in this predicament. The words contract and money drift across my brain. That seems to line up with what he’s shouting about. I try to listen in.

“-obligated, by your pact with the Wholesome Proplenitentiary, which you signed in blood, might I remind you-”

I tune him out, and check my hand. There’s definitely a new prick mark there. I don’t do anything through the index finger, so it’s probably got something to do with extraterrestrials or some other species capable of reading index cards. Those happen from time to time. I decide to listen in again, see if I can’t catch the details.

“-hours late, and your presence is required. As the second in the duel, Mister Scott Darling, your lead has made himself unavailable. You’re up.”

Oh. Shit. 

A bundle is shoved into my arms, while a new order to get dressed is barked out. Standing halfheartedly, I stagger into the dirty pair of battle garments. A tricorn is squished onto my head, and before I can say bob’s your uncle, I’m out the door.

The gloomy sun, dim as it is, still shines brightly enough to irritate me. I take a few steps, before stumbling onto a fencepost and vomiting again.

“Blorg. Where do they find these sapsuckers?” asked a feminine voice, as a hand yanks me back to my feet.

I blink a few more times, and start getting a clearer picture. The black smear is a man in black, wearing a ceremonial dueling robe. The yellow smear, a woman, wore a blouse and a rarity- makeup.

My thoughts are interrupted as I’m stuffed into a back seat. As soon as I’m in, we’ve taken off, careening in a direction I can’t quite make out from the vantage point of being jammed into the floor. 

From how many bumps we’re running into, though, we can’t be headed for the good part of the ville. 

Finally, after what feels like minutes, yet another hand grabs and yanks me back into the limelight. I can see now. Finally.

We’re out in a big green field, with daffodils merrily dancing in the breeze. Around us, pine trees bristle in the wind. A pistol is slapped into my hand, and I’m given a final shove to glory. I suddenly notice the duelmaster standing between me and a rather sickly looking gentleman, holding a pistol that could match the one I’m holding.

Wait, why am I holding a pistol again?

I look around, trying to make sense of it all. I ruled out still being asleep, or hallucinating. I call out. “Wait! What the fuck is going on here?”

The duelmaster looks up from his scroll, frowning loudly. “Hey, buddy, don’t interrupt me. I’m trying to get this spiel done with. Don’t worry. It’ll all be over soon. Just take ten steps, shoot, and we can all go home.”

I shrug, try and fail to lift the pistol to my side, and spin to begin pacing.

1,2,3…

I ponder the possibility of running, and decide that maybe dying in a duel is definitely better than going to court, and getting a sentence. I shuddered at the thought.

4,5,6…

I remember to cock the pistol, and pray that the gunpowder can’t get wet from hand-sweat.

7,8,9…

I make peace with the gods of any religions I can remember, and the devil, too. Might as well play it from both ends.

10…

I turn, eyes jammed shut, and fire.

I opened my eyes, and saw the sickly man groaning on the ground, covered in blood and shit and tears. I looked down at my smoking gun, and then back to the entourage. I’d hoped for maybe shock, but instead they seemed more apathetic than anything else.

“Well.” said the woman, stretching. “Second killed the second. Nothing of value lost. Let’s clean up and head out. Cadbury’s got an appointment at noon.”

The duelmaster checked his scroll. “Cadbury’s second is out… you could use this little Darling again, though.”

They all look at me, to each other, and nod before beginning another advance towards me. I hold on to my wallet, and gulp audibly.</textarea></pre>
