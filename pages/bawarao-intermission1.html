[[[degenerate-art|Bastian Schaus]]]&#39;s... well, //everything// hurt. The sight of Acolyte Dunst bursting into his sickroom inspired surprisingly little to offset that.

&#34;{{Well, look at you.}}&#34; Today, Dunst wore a polka-dotted dress, the hem of which ended beyond Bastian&#39;s field of vision. Secured to her waist was her favorite belt; Bastian spotted, with a reasonable level of disgust, several more Xs carved into the red leather than last he saw it. The small, blackened vial around her neck didn&#39;t inspire much more confidence.

If Bastian had anything to say, and he didn&#39;t, it was buried underneath a mountain of bruises.

&#34;{{Rule number one for celebrities: never trust a meal you didn&#39;t cook.}}&#34; Dunst kneeled beyond Bastian&#39;s field of vision, rummaging through her bag for whatever she intended to ruin Bastian&#39;s day with. &#34;{{Like it or not, Salz, you&#39;re a celebrity. And as, er, dedicated you may be, Lichtenberg&#39;s filled with idiots. One sec.}}&#34;

Dunst flicked something metal, and Bastian&#39;s heart sunk. The sedative gas was almost formality at that point.

&#34;{{Rule number two, look the part.}}&#34; In direct violation of his screaming neurons, Bastian&#39;s field of view remained fixed on Dunst and the IV bag that wasn&#39;t as full as it had been a second ago. &#34;{{I make a good &#34;girlfriend&#34; for you, don&#39;t you think? Didn&#39;t even need to gas the receptionist.}}&#34;

The strain with which Bastian attempted to scowl had to count for //some// kind of exercise.

Dunst finally settled down into a seat next to Bastian&#39;s bed, and whatever smirk she&#39;d bore on the way in gave way to an all-too-familiar stern neutrality. &#34;{{[[[last-minute-resistance|Andino]]]&#39;s dead, if you haven&#39;t already heard. One of the commies overrode the Hag&#39;s controls. The wehrdaemons put up a good fight, but we&#39;re still down an initiate.}}&#34; Dunst hissed a theatrical sigh. &#34;{{So that&#39;s one less specialist for the next batch.}}&#34;

Dunst&#39;s stare burned a hole into Bastian, who attempted to return the favor. &#34;{{You can talk, Salz. I&#39;m not so boring as to deny you //that//.}}&#34;

&#34;Andino was a degenerate and I know you can speak German, Acolyte Dunst.&#34; Thankfully, any pain in Bastian&#39;s throat was dulled by his sheer rage.

&#34;{{And //you// can speak English. Humor a simple Ontario girl, //Bastian//.}}&#34;

&#34;I&#39;ll agree to disagree, //Theresa//.&#34;

Dunst said nothing, merely fiddled with the vial around her neck. If a nurse was coming in to interrupt them, they better make it quick; the moment Bastian would regain control of his arms held a violent uncertainty beyond even the typical malcontent reserved for moments between him and Dunst.

&#34;{{... so.}}&#34; All at once, Dunst straightened her posture. &#34;{{I&#39;ve made some improvements to the BLACK FLY formula.}}&#34;

&#34;By eliminating it from the sum of human knowledge?&#34;

&#34;{{What is with you people? Genocide is a-okay but the moment I propose a way to kill //less// people, suddenly you care for &#39;morality&#39;.}}&#34; Dunst unclasped her necklace, and Bastian&#39;s thoughts drifted back to the red belt around her waist. &#34;{{If we put every initiate through a round of BLACK FLY, let alone those SWJC goons, maybe we wouldn&#39;t be getting our asses handed to us by gaggles of queers.}}&#34;

Bastian&#39;s arms were still paralyzed, or he would have sat himself up. &#34;You think yourself a doctor. Yet, in the face of an infection, you peddle cancer.&#34; Bastian spat. &#34;I&#39;ve seen {{BLACK FLY}}. It&#39;s cruelty, under the thinnest veneer of &#39;efficiency&#39;. A vet //puts down// sick animals, he doesn&#39;t prolong their torment.&#34;

The black vial was unclasped from Dunst&#39;s necklace, undercutting the brief silence between her next words. &#34;{{You act like they&#39;re people, Salz. Anything less than a rat. Have you considered that, perhaps, utopia necessitates the suffering of rats?}}&#34; Dunst set the vial down, and rifled back through her bag. &#34;{{And, perhaps, it&#39;s more than rats. Perhaps it&#39;s the architects of the new world. Their hidden tumors.}}&#34;

Dunst emerged from the depths of her bag, syringe in tow.

&#34;{{You&#39;re sick, Salz. It&#39;s so obvious, how you carry yourself. How you walk, how you talk.}}&#34; Dunst&#39;s horrid smile, the one she bore on too many joint missions, reached her eyes and nowhere else as the syringe stuck the vial. &#34;{{And I can fix you. Make you //right// again. Bring out the good buried under your dirty little secret.}}&#34;

&#39;//What are you talking about//&#39;, Bastian did not say.

The flick of Dunst&#39;s finger against the syringe thundered through his sickroom, loud enough to rattle his skull yet not so loud as to alert a nurse.

&#34;{{I know you want this. You don&#39;t have an alternative.}}&#34; Slowly, steadily, Dunst positioned the syringe above Bastian&#39;s neck. &#34;{{You can hold out for another cure as long as you want, but your reality is terminal. Let BLACK FLY be your new truth.}}&#34; She smiled, and-

The door opened, and Dunst withdrew her syringe without another word. &#34;Afternoon. Just checking up on Mr. Schaus.&#34;

A distinctly indistinct voice almost purred in response. &#34;Well, I&#39;m glad to find //someone// hasn&#39;t forgotten poor little Salz.&#34; Soft steps against tile accompanied a sudden crack in Dunst&#39;s composure; if Bastian could turn to face the man who almost certainly stood at his right, maybe that would explain the sudden drop in temperature. &#34;He smells of your favorite air freshener. Have you been taking care of him, Acolyte Dunst?&#34;

Dunst kept herself from swallowing, but the twitch of her neck muscles would have exposed her either way. &#34;I... worry for him, Mr. Rass. Only wish he feels better.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;d be careful with your experiments, Acolyte Dunst. Acolyte Salz has been through //quite// enough, wouldn&#39;t you agree?&#34;

&#34;... yes, Mr. Rass. Thank you.&#34;

Dunst collected her equipment (and, atypically, //only// her equipment) and hurriedly left Bastian&#39;s side. Mr. Rass did not move to take her seat.

&#34;Sometimes I worry for you, Acolyte Salz. You&#39;re the biggest fish in the pond, but you&#39;ll break before you deign to bend.&#34; An incredibly cold hand-shaped imprint manifested onto Bastian&#39;s shoulder. &#34;It&#39;s no wonder the degenerates chose you to make such an example of.&#34; Mr. Rass sighed, or otherwise feigned one. &#34;It must hurt, but I ask you not be discouraged. Deceit and swarming is the only language such insects comprehend. But a boar such as yourself... well, they can take you back to the watering hole, but you&#39;ll be back. Don&#39;t be scared of the rats.&#34;

Mr. Rass leaned into Bastian&#39;s ear, his breathless words near indistinguishable from the errant thoughts of Bastian&#39;s mind. &#34;It&#39;s your rancher who should frighten you.&#34;

And Mr. Rass wasn&#39;t there.
