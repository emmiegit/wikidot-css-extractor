**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2043 is contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber.  Subject is to be monitored and recorded at all times by two or more individuals and/or video recorders.  In the event of a containment breach, personnel who come into contact with SCP-2043 are advised to maintain eye contact with subject until fully contained.  

Due to subject&#39;s inability to communicate and tendency to wander, personnel are to consistently monitor Site-3399 for additional instances of SCP-2043.  Use of nonlethal force is authorized if practicable.  Containment teams are to consist of no more than two individuals per unit.

**Description:** SCP-2043 is a 19 year old Caucasian female bearing resemblance to a former missing person Ariella █████ (**Note:** See section 19-A3).  When an individual observing the subject looks away,[[footnote]]Testing has shown mammals, avians, most reptiles and amphibians, and video recording devices trigger this effect as well[[/footnote]] SCP-2043 will create physical duplicates of themselves within the individual&#39;s line of sight.  Each new instance will additionally begin to duplicate in turn at a rate of 20-30 seconds per duplication.

Duplicate instances of SCP-2043 are physically and genetically identical to the original.  The effect is increased exponentially with the addition of more viewers, although a fixed number (minimum 2) of viewers can minimize chances of duplication by maintaining overlapping lines of sight.

SCP-2043 is generally unresponsive to external stimuli, remaining nonresponsive to all attempts at communication as well as most attempts at physical contact.  SCP-2043&#39;s awareness of physical contact appears to be uniform amongst all duplicated instances, which may result in mass panic among SCP-2043 instances, and the potential for uncontrolled duplication depending on SCP-2043 instances&#39; mobility.  Attempts at teaching SCP-2043 to communicate via touch have yielded little success.

**Note 19-A3:** Ariella █████ went missing from [REDACTED] on 7/██/19██ at age 7 before being discovered ten years later in the cellar of a neighbor.  Further details are unavailable due to an ongoing investigation.

SCP-2043 was discovered nine years following the disappearance 70 km away, when police were called by an individual who claimed to have discovered Ariella █████ in her cellar.  It is unknown if SCP-2043&#39;s effects were evident to the individual.  The presence of multiple officers triggered the apparition of several hundred instances of SCP-2043, which led to an incident in which shots were fired and multiple instances of SCP-2043 were killed.  Foundation personnel were alerted to the situation 18 hours later, necessitating a temporary quarantine of the town of [REDACTED] and mass-administration of Class-B Amnestics to affected individuals (██,███).

Following this event and a thorough investigation, it was noted that SCP-2043 bore a strong resemblance to age-progressed photographs of Ariella █████.  A potential link to the disappearance led to a renewed investigation leading to the individual&#39;s recovery.  A separate parallel investigation by Foundation agents embedded in [REDACTED] found that Ariella █████ had had no knowledge of SCP-2043 nor the individual responsible for discovering SCP-2043.  Ms. █████ was also noted to look substantially different from her age-progressed photo.  Further details are classified pending an ongoing investigation.

**Addendum:** Following a recurrence of SCP-2043 apparitions have been reported in the town of [REDACTED], it was discovered that of the individuals exposed to SCP-2043, ██% have retained memory of SCP-2043 and repeated administration of amnestics was found to be necessary to remove memory of SCP-2043.  Due to risk of auto-immune and/or neurological disorder as a result of frequent use of high-level amnestics, a cover story has been released and the town placed under watch for recurrences.

Residents of the town frequently hold conferences and rallies in support of SCP-2043, forming a group called &#34;Remember Ari&#34;, calling for renewed efforts to locate Ariella █████.  Informing unaware residents of Ms. █████&#39;s successful recovery has been largely unsuccessful, as residents quickly return to campaigns and foundations for &#34;Remember Ari&#34;.  Various stories have been offered by residents to explain this apparent discrepancy, including claims that Ariella █████&#39;s sister simultaneously disappeared, or else referring to SCP-2043 as &#34;another Ari&#34; or &#34;the other Ari&#34;.

**Addendum 2:** As of ██/██/2014, Ariella █████ and her mother have been confirmed as members of &#34;Remember Ari&#34;.

**Addendum 3:** On ██/██/2014, the bodies of two identical twin boys were discovered in [REDACTED] (approximately 700 meters from the recovery site of SCP-2043), bearing gunshot wounds at close range.  Discovered on the scene was a missing person&#39;s poster for a child Lee ████ ███, containing an age-progressed photo depicting Lee as a teenager.  As with SCP-2043, both deceased individuals bore a strong resemblance to the age-progressed photo.  While Lee ████ ███ has yet to be found, a potential link to SCP-2043 cannot be conclusively established.
