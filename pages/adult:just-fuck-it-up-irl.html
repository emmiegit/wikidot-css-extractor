&#34;There&#39;s a bottle on his penis?&#34; 

&#34;There&#39;s a bottle on his penis,&#34; Clef confirmed.

The voice on the other end of the line was silent. Then, with a low exasperated sigh, it asked the one question that any reasonable or not-so-reasonable person could ask in this situation.

//&#34;HOW?&#34;//

&#34;Beats me. Hey, &#39;Draki, how the fuck did you manage to get a bottle on your dick anyway?&#34; Clef asked.

&#34;Fuck you,&#34; Kondraki grumbled.

&#34;He doesn&#39;t say,&#34; Clef said into the phone. &#34;Anyway, I was just wondering, is this a regular thing with your Dad? Is there a procedure for this sort of thing? Like, do you guys have a bottle-dick-remover on call or something? Some guy you usually call in this sort of situation?&#34;

&#34;Alto. . .&#34;

&#34;Look, I figure bottle-dick-remover is kind of like a plumber: you don&#39;t want to call someone else if you already know a guy, because the second guy will kind of fuck things up because they won&#39;t do it the same way as your usual g-- and he just hung up on me. Your son is fucking rude, Ben.&#34;

&#34;I swear to God if you don&#39;t do something about this now, I will not only kill you, I will make sure it is painful,&#34; Kondraki snarled.

&#34;Hey, don&#39;t worry about it!&#34; Clef said. &#34;It&#39;s no big deal. We&#39;ll just get you to Site-69, and we&#39;ll have a medic cut that bottle off your dick with what the hell is that fucking noise, it sounds like a fire alarm?&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s the fucking fire alarm,&#34; Kondraki confirmed.

Clef carefully went to the apartment door and stuck his head out the door. Every door on the floor was open, and all of Kondraki&#39;s neighbors were walking out into the hallway, grumbling to themselves as they filed down the hall to the stairs. &#34;Hey,&#34; Clef asked. &#34;You know what this is about?&#34; 

&#34;Not exactly,&#34; an older woman in a blue flower-print nightie said. &#34;I think it might just be a false alar--&#34;

There was a cry of alarm from the end of the hallway as the door to the stairs opened, revealing a cloud of thick white smoke.

&#34;-- or not, holy shit!&#34; the old woman cried. &#34;Let&#39;s get the hell out of here!&#34;

Clef carefully closed the door and turned to his boyfriend, who had somehow managed to go green with nausea, white with fear, and red with rage all at once. &#34;Your apartment building&#39;s on fire,&#34; he said, unnecessarily.

Kondraki looked down at the Aquafina bottle on his dick, then over at his apartment door, then back at the windows, and finally back down at his dick. &#34;Leave me to die,&#34; he moaned. &#34;Save yourself!&#34;

&#34;Bullshit,&#34; Clef replied curtly. &#34;We ride together. We die together. You&#39;re coming with me if I have to knock you out and carry you on my back.&#34;

&#34;You couldn&#39;t knock me out if you tried,&#34; Kondraki retorted. &#34;I&#39;ll kill you first.&#34;

&#34;Oh, there we go again with the killing and the stabbing. God, Ben, you&#39;ve got such a one-track mind. Just suck it up and throw on a trench coat or something. No one will know.&#34;

Kondraki rushed back into his bedroom. There was the sound of some rummaging around in the closet. He came out wearing a black trench coat with a gigantic, tent-shaped bulge in the front at crotch level. &#34;Wow,&#34; he said flatly. &#34;This sure did help a lot. No one will notice anything wrong now, yes siree-bob.&#34;

&#34;Fuck. . .&#34; Clef glanced out the door. The smoke was starting to build up a bit, and the last few neighbors were quickly making their way down the stairs, heads lowered and wet rags placed over their faces. &#34;All right,&#34; Clef said. &#34;I didn&#39;t want to do this. . . but we have no choice.&#34; He took a deep breath. &#34;Where&#39;s your pantry?&#34;

-----
&#34;Wow, holy shit,&#34; Captain Buchanan said. &#34;That&#39;s not great.&#34;

The fire was largely contained to a single unit on the northern side of the apartment building, but it was clear from the flames licking the curtains and the lurid orange-red glow that could be seen through the window that this was no mere trash can fire, a fact further evident to the dozens of glum-looking people in night dress standing on the sidewalk nearby. &#34;All right,&#34; he said into the radio. &#34;Let&#39;s get these bystanders out of the way first. I want. . .&#34;

Buchanan&#39;s voice trailed off.

There were two men walking down the sidewalk, both of them wearing scarves around their heads and wide-brimmed hats. Only scarves around their heads and wide-brimmed hats.

And one other thing.

Water bottles.

Each of the two men in question had a water bottle on the end of their dicks.

Captain Buchanan&#39;s radio handset fell from his nerveless fingers. He felt his world collapse inward. The fire, his waiting firefighters, the bystanders standing on the sidewalk. . . it all fell away, leaving behind only himself, his eyes, and two stark-naked middle aged men merrily walking down the street with hats on their heads, scarves on their faces, and water bottle on their ding-a-lings.

The two men skipped into a car. One of them turned, made eye contact, and shot Captain Buchanan the finger-guns.

The car started up and drove away.</textarea></pre>
