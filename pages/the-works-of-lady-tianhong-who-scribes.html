Walk past the Main Hall, towards the East; a trip of three days in human steps, or a couple hours, were you to fly above the endless corridors of the Library, each filled with endless Shelves, filled with endless Books. The fourth time you think you should have already arrived, you’ll arrive; a shelf with green ornaments, small jades and agates absorbed into rosewood, positioned in between a shelf with a book collection made entirely out of feline eyes, and a Tower of the Occasus, one of seventy thousand and sixty three contraptions that together make sure that no Study Area throughout the Library is without Natural Light.

This jade shelf is filled with thousands of items, only a fragment being proper books, written in paper and ink. From left to right, you find oracle bones, ox scapulae, turtle plastra, slabs of stone and clay, bamboo slits, papyrus and leather, bronze figurines, amber, Changhua stones, the list goes on and on. You realize most, if not all these items have inscriptions on them; some mere pictographs, or perhaps dead languages, but as you move towards the slabs, papyrus and paper, recognizable languages appear.

As you keep going down the hallway, you eventually reach the end, the shelf still extending, yet remaining empty from that point onwards. At the divide between fulfillment and void, you find a woman placing a new book for the collection. The woman is wearing the clothes of an empress, a rainbow of embroidments and textures finely adorned with feathers of avians long extinct. A silken scarf calmly floats around her, attuned to the dance of a golden headdress. She turns, then smiles.

“Hello.” She nods, a slim radiance emanating from her being. “My name is Tianhong, the one who scribes. Are you here to find a tale of the past?”

Well, are you?
[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop show=&#34;I am.&#34;|hide=&#34;Then pick a text; any that calls to you. You&#39;ll find a worthwhile tale, whichever you take.&#34;]]

You look at the myriad of works in front of you until something catches your eye.

++ Lady Tianhong, who Scribes
[[/=]]

Tianhong, the author whose work fill this shelf, is a Tennin, or Tianzi, or Feitian, or simply a Celestial. Her names have been many throughout the years, of which she&#39;s lived at least twenty thousand, according to the earliest book one can find here. (If fractured bones can be considered a book, of course.)

A humble servant of the Devas, Tianhong has been tasked with chronicling the tales of men with the purpose of sharing this same knowledge with humanity at large, acting as a guide towards enlightenment. The Devas of higher realms have blessed humanity with endless envoys that will help lower realms facilitate one&#39;s path through the cycle of Samsara; Tianhong being one of these.

Tianhong&#39;s duty is structured as such: She travels the Earth, flying a path already written beforehand. Each day, she arrives at a location, where she&#39;ll spend twenty four hours recollecting tales, and relaying previous ones to the locals. Once the day is over, she departs for the next location. This cycle renews every one and twenty years, so once Tianhong is done visiting the last place, she&#39;ll return to the first. She thus has become a piece of culture; a constant molded to observe and relay change throughout all land under Heaven.

[[tab A New Tale in the Making]]
If you wish to add to the author&#39;s works, it would be helpful to consider the following:

++++ About the Writing

* The most important part of this work is that it&#39;s an anthology: There is no overarching plot, and you can write about anything you wish as long as it fits the themes. This doesn&#39;t means that you can&#39;t write several articles that follow a plot, but rather that all articles for this author do not have to directly connect with each other.
* The main theme of this author is documenting change: Whether proper change or lack thereof, what defines humanity is constant improvement. Our ability to change and adapt to said change is what makes humanity what it is. Given that Tianhong visits each place every 21 years, a period one could consider a generation, one could expect some things to change every time she revisits a location.
* The secondary theme is, of course, humanity: Tianhong records the tales of all under Heaven. This refers to humans, beasts, myths, heroes and even Deities, but all are mortal, have desires, duties, needs, emotions, etc. A God can err as easily as any human. Only those who have broken the cycle of Samsara are beyond humanity, and none inhabit this realm.
* All land under Heaven refers to Asia, in this case, China, with this counry and Japan being important locations for her travels. However, these are not the only ones. If you can and wish to fit a story in any other nearby country, feel free to do so. Mongolia, Russia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Korea, India, Burma- If you can make it work, then go ahead!
*  When it comes down to period of time, anything goes. While the feel of most tales is that of a fable or myth of long gone places, they can be placed during any era. Do you wanna write about Tianhong visiting a place ten thousand years ago? Go ahead. Wish to write about Tianhong visiting another place twenty, maybe just ten years ago? Also possible. As long as it fits all previous points, you can write about it.
* As a last point: You might have noticed a certain stylistic choice in the entries here, mainly about the division paper and the seals used to end each of these. While it&#39;s not necessary to use them, they are nice to look at and help with the atmosphere of each piece. You&#39;re welcome to take any of the divisions or seals from their respective entries and use them in any way you wish! (You can also make your own seals/divisions, if you want! Or pester [[*user Maxyfran73]] and he might make a seal or something for your entry because he really liked making the ones already here.)

++++ About Tianhong
* As explained before, Tianhong chronicles the lives of all under Heaven on her book. She travels to each place, stays for 24 hours, then leaves, returning once 21 years have passed. This is her Divine duty, and proof of her permanence.
* Tianhong is a Celestial, but as stated before, even Gods can show emotions and commit mistakes. Tianhong&#39;s emotions lean towards compassion, and a desire to teach others, but she isn&#39;t without flaw; she can get upset and she can get sad. Again, she can even make mistakes. Not often, but when you live thousand of years, you&#39;re bound to at some point. Don&#39;t believe that because she&#39;s eternal and unchanging that she is cold and/or devoid of feelings.
* At some point, Tianhong began visiting the Wanderer&#39;s Library, leaving copies of her work right here, on this shelf. [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/the-magpie-leaves-its-nest-fleeing-winter Someone once moved all her work to this place], but stopped at some point. Tianhong has since been tasked with visiting the Library as part of her cycle, replenishing her own ambry.
