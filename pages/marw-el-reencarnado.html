A soul in pain that was condemned to be reincarnated from body to body for all eternity, being several cats [[footnote]] Each one cuter than the last. ~//Doroti.I// [[/footnote]] from all over the world carried his name on their backs and with it all their abilities and deformities. From the most incredible abilities to tumors that could only be compared to the flesh of the Karcists. Some of these cats have left their name in history as deities, thieves, monsters, and great librarians. With all this being said, join me to hear the story of the mythical cat Marw.

**Knowledge**
[[/=]]

**Characteristics:** Marws usually look like domestic cats of different breeds, although some unfortunate few may suffer from mutations either by developing tumors in various parts of their body or with missing parts such as paws, ears, eyes, tail[[footnote]]Although there are cases where a Marw has two tails, this would be the only limb or body part that is duplicated.. //~ The Library Cat//[[/footnote]]etc. But there have been miraculous cases where a Marw is born without these despicable deformities or has not developed them.

All Marws possess the ability to reincarnate once they die, this is due to the side effects of the Daevite rituals used in the original Marw. Each reincarnation, apart from the aforementioned deformities, inherits abilities that are also caused by the rituals used in the Original. Among the abilities that the Marws have inherited include, but are not limited to: transmutation into other animals or humans; the ability to vocalize; use of magic; the command of a higher intellect than that of a human being[[footnote]] I propose to change this part to &#34;with an intellect highly superior to that of a human with a high IQ.” ~//The Library Cat.// [[/footnote]] [[footnote]]Don&#39;t exaggerate either, I mean, if you have that high knowledge you don&#39;t seem to use it so often and even less when I beat you at chess.  //~Maria.N//[[/footnote]] [[footnote]]T-those are different circumstances!- //The Library Cat.// [[/footnote]], and in many cases, the ability to change in size.

Apart from the aforementioned, all the reincarnations are completely unique from each other, so they all have very unique personalities and ways of acting, although each and every one of them self-identify with the name Marw. [[footnote]]The name Marw comes from a Daevite word meaning &#34;the one who survives&#34; or &#34;the one who did not die&#34;. It was mostly used to refer to soldiers who returned from the battlefield unharmed or those who survive tests of magic as is the case with the original Marw. ~//Maria.N// [[/footnote]] [[footnote]]Believe me this was a big problem during my childhood. My poor mother would always call one and the other would come because unconsciously she could only refer to all of us as Marw. //~The Library Cat// [[/footnote]], this seems to affect even people outside the knowledge of their history, since in one way or another they end up calling them Marw unconsciously. [[footnote]]The aforementioned does not seem to affect the writing, so in order not to blow our minds when we write something about these pussycats we decided to refer to them with nicknames. These can be chosen by members of the Hand or by the Marws. //~Doroti.I//  [[/footnote]]


**Nature:** As already mentioned, the behavior of all Marws is different, but the main behaviors of three of the four currently living Marws are as follows:

**&#34;The Detective&#34;:** He is usually found both outside and inside the Foundation, according to some he acts like a detective in classic black and white movies, is a smoker, action-loving and very charismatic. It seems that every so often he comes out of the Jailers&#39; containment to solve some case.

**&#34;The Proud Farmer&#34;:**[[footnote]]Oh come on, he&#39;s your brother you can give him a nicer alias at least. //~Doroti.I//[[/footnote]][[footnote]]I don&#39;t care what any of you say, this name stays. Period. - //The Library Cat.//[[/footnote]] He is in the custody of Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Solutions, and seems to only act affectionate with his caretaker, while with other people he acts aggressive and proud. Usually scratches people he doesn&#39;t like.

**“The Library Cat”:** She is a recurring visitor to The Wanderer&#39;s Library, like the Proud Farmer she shows an arrogant attitude, but at the same time she is a good reading guide, loves to recommend books, and loves it when they ask for her opinion on something. [[footnote]]When I find the one who compared me to that idiot, I&#39;ll scratch their whole face off! - //~The Library Cat.//[[/footnote]]

**History and Associated Parties:** The story of the first Marw takes place in the Daevite empire, he was born as a completely normal cat.[[footnote]]Why do you say &#34;completely normal&#34;, don&#39;t you think it will be offensive to other Marws?//~Doroti.I//[[/footnote]] [[footnote]] Doroti, we are cats that don&#39;t follow any natural rules, I&#39;m sure the other Marws will understand.  - //~“The Library Cat”.//[[/footnote]], but when he was 5 years old he was imprisoned by an ancient Daevite sorcerer, who had the reputation of experimenting with animals, since then Marw was the victim of terrible experiments, archaic symbols were engraved all over his body, he was used as a blood storage for rituals, and he was even used as a test subject to find a way to counteract Sarkic magic. Despite all these calamities Marw managed to live to the age of 14, the last experiment in which he took part was in a ritual to grant eternal life, which ironically ended up taking his life. That last ritual freed Marw&#39;s soul, it allowed him to roam the world to find other bodies to inhabit, every time he entered a newborn cat body all his memories were gone, but his abilities and deformities remained as a kind of parasite.


And so it was that Marw began his cycle of death and reincarnation over time, sometimes playing a key role in history, at other times being a mere spectator, and several times falling asleep without doing anything. A reincarnation of Marw known as &#34;The Librarian&#34; was the first Marw to find the ways and ally himself with the Wanderer&#39;s Library.  He convinced several members of the Library to help all the reincarnations of Marw, this mission has been left in the hands of several people who have known the history of this intriguing being, among them members of the Serpent&#39;s Hand.
 
Unfortunately, this mission was overshadowed by a strange event. During the search for Marw&#39;s last reincarnation, it was discovered that this time Marw&#39;s soul had split into five different bodies, two females and three males. Unfortunately, as soon as this was discovered only the two females could be recovered, while the males had completely disappeared.

See //Confirmed Reincarnations// for the fate of these five Marws..

**Approach:** It is recommended that you act in a cordial manner with the Marws, and not do anything that would upset a normal cat.

For &#34;The Detective&#34; it is recommended to talk to him about police cases, offer him mental challenges, and try to keep him away from cigarettes. Also, if given the opportunity, try to get him to consider the idea of leaving the Jailers. At the same time, it is recommended that secret Library matters not be discussed in his presence, as he is considered a very skilled and loyal Jailer.   

For &#34;The Proud Farmer&#34; if your assigned handler is not around give him a glass of milk and stay away from him, that will increase the chances that he will not end up scratching you in the face. It is not recommended to pet him, or stare at him, he is very grumpy with most people.   

And for &#34;The Library Cat&#34; it is recommended that you talk to her about literature, her favorite subjects are psychology and chess strategy books, she also likes to talk about science. She will act calmly as long as you don&#39;t bother her with questions or phrases that she might consider silly. [[footnote]]The last part is really necessary.//~Maria.N//[[/footnote]] [[footnote]]Yeah, or do you want everyone to get scratched? I&#39;m just warning of the inevitable.//~&#34;The Library Cat”//[[/footnote]]

He had a mutation that allowed him to have two tails, he had the ability to change his size and walk on two legs.

His abilities ranged from shape-shifting, the ability to breathe underwater, and the use of magic to a lesser extent. On his back lay large tumors which were slightly hidden by his extensive dark-as-night fur.  His desires for terror ended when one of the brothers of the Library Sir. Arthur of Brittany took his life in the name of his land. This act was debated for several decades, some supported his death, but others argued that the Cath Palug was only a primordial entity that protected the seas and only sought human acceptance.

Although we are dedicated to gather all the information about Marw hidden among the books, we still don&#39;t know exactly what could have caused the Marw&#39;s soul to split into five parts, nor do we know if with the death of the &#34;fallen&#34; one there is now a new Marw out there somewhere; or if Marw&#39;s soul didn&#39;t just split into five parts, and if there are more Marws around the world that we haven&#39;t found yet.
