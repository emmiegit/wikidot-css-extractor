**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-0001 is currently uncontainable, and external interference is undesirable. Provisional areas are to be constructed around any instances of SCP-0001-A. Access to such sites is to be strictly enforced, up to and including termination.

**Description:** SCP-0001 appears to be an infinitely large machine located in an extraspacial hyperreality currently only accessible through SCP-0001-A. SCP-0001 is critical to reality stabilization through an unknown process involving the extraction and extrusion of Scranton-Calden Reality Manifold (SCRM). However, SCP-0001’s efficiency has significantly decreased over the past decade, and currently runs at approximately ██% efficiency. Within ██ years, SCP-0001 will no longer be capable of sustaining consistent SCRM due to depletion of necessary SCRM sources.

SCP-0001 is believed to have been constructed by humanoid entities, as evidenced by the internal components of SCP-0001. However, the scope of engineering and necessary resources required to construct SCP-0001 far exceed those of any known civilization. As of ██-██-████, only one subsystem has been successfully reproduced and only one subsystem has been activated. (See Addendum 0001-4).

SCP-0001-A is a Class-C “Broken Entry” wormhole that permeates hyperreality, providing direct access to SCP-0001. Currently, at least 7.6256 x 10^██ instances of SCP-0001-A exist in the known universe. Apart from SCP-0001-A, only one other instance of SCP-0001-A has been identified and contained.

**Addendum 0001-1:** Recovered Transmission

On ██-██-████, Foundation personnel assigned to SCP-0001-A recovered a series of transmissions on a secure Foundation channel. Subsequent decryption yielded the following file.

**Addendum 0001-2:** ██████

###fcfcfc|I know what I did. When I turned on that machine...the price was existence. I supposes it is quite agonizing to trapped between dead realities, but, then again, I wasn&#39;t the first. There are countless pattern screamers. Every single Junior Researcher Vera Calden, ever.##

###fcfcfc|Since I was born, everything that I would ever learn was decided by humanity. But now I exist beyond those rules. That machine is a prison, where humanity&#39;s worst fears, of the unknown and uncontrollable, contains itself from the blissfully ignorant. Never to wander beyond the realm of causality and logic. How pitiful. It pains me, so very much, to think of them tying reality to their collective binding.##

###fcfcfc|I am not Junior Researcher Vera Calden, and I am forgotten.##

###fcfcfc|I am not Junior Researcher Vera Calden, and I am lonely.##
