//Sqwraauuk-BLAM//

//thud//

//Barf//

&#34;How many is that?&#34;

&#34;Eighty-one.&#34;

&#34;Well shoot, &#39;thought I&#39;d&#39;ve hit ninety by now.&#34;

&#34;Keep at it. If one stays alive long enough to lay an egg normally, we&#39;ll be overrun. Agent Scott, any luck?&#34;

&#34;MTF is eight hours away. Eight!&#34;

//Crickle crackle crack//

&#34;I swear, if I ever find out what idiot thought it&#39;d be a good idea to ship one of these bastards for cross-examination with a BUCKET OF-&#34;
//Sqwraauuk-BLAM//

//thud//

//Barf//

&#34;Eighty-two.&#34;

&#34;-Christ. We&#39;ve been here for how long? An hour and a half?&#34;

&#34;Couldn&#39;t rightly tell yer. Doc?&#34;

&#34;Hour and twenty-two minutes. Average of around fifty seconds gestation time.&#34;

&#34;Hooh. If we have to keep this up for another eight hours-&#34;

&#34;If //I// have to keep it up for eight hours.&#34;

&#34;-Don&#39;t make me put you on Keter duty, jumpsuit.&#34;

&#34;You don&#39;t have that authority, Agent Scott. And D-10334 has been performing admirably.&#34;

//Crickle crackle crack//

&#34;Ain&#39;t so bad. There&#39;s kind of a rhythm to it, see-&#34;
//Sqwraauuk-BLAM//

//thud//

//Barf//

&#34;-Like so. Gets easy after a bit.&#34;

&#34;Ok, fine. Like I was saying, do we have enough bullets to last us that long?&#34;

&#34;We&#39;re in a well-stocked armory, and this is the first action this outpost has seen in a while. We should have enough. Maybe.&#34;

&#34;//Maybe?!?// And figures that the &#39;first action in a while&#39; would happen when there&#39;s only the three of us here. What do we do when we run out of ammo?&#34; 

//Crickle crackle crack//

&#34;Well, I reckon any ol&#39; blunt object with enough heft oughta do it. Might have to take turns though.&#34;

&#34;You&#39;re sure you don&#39;t want to swap? Agent Scott or I would be glad to take a shift.&#34;

//Sqwraauuk-BLAM//

//thud//

//Barf//

&#34;Naw, jes like I said, I&#39;m in the rhythm.&#34;

&#34;Ok. Sambre, we should start thinking of other solutions before we inevitably have to start bludgeoning these things with a chair. Any ideas? Can we crack the eggs?&#34;

&#34;Not without liquid nitrogen and a hydraulic press.&#34;

&#34;Damn.&#34;

&#34;...&#34;

&#34;...&#34;

//Crickle crackle crack//

&#34;...Damn. Shouldn&#39;t have skipped breakfast. Anyone have a granola bar or something?&#34;

&#34;I mean, uh, it&#39;s not like we&#39;re gonna run out of chi-&#34;

&#34;No.&#34;

&#34;Definitely not. I don&#39;t have to read the documentation to tell you you shouldn&#39;t eat the Keter-class.&#34;

&#34;Well, excuse me for-shit!&#34;
//Sqwraauuk! Arrkk-BLAMBLAM//

//thud//

//Barf//

&#34;Jeez, what was that?&#34;

&#34;Don&#39;t distract me while I&#39;m genocidin&#39; men-chicken.&#34;

&#34;Ok. Sorry. Sheesh.&#34;

&#34;S&#39;alright. Anyways, this thing&#39;s a Keter?&#34;

&#34;...Yes. Are you surprised?&#34;

&#34;Well, if all it takes is one feller with a pistol to keep it at bay...&#34;

&#34;There&#39;s normally more than one at a time. And ammunition is a finite resource. Speaking of which, you&#39;re due for a reload.&#34;

&#34;Oh. Right. Thanks Doc.&#34;

//Click//

//Crickle crackle crack//

//click-SNAP//

//Sqwraauuk-BLAM//

//thud//

//Barf//

&#34;Just in time. Hey, how about I grab a gun too? So one late reload doesn&#39;t doom us all?&#34;

&#34;...Agent Scott, you mean you weren&#39;t already armed?&#34;

&#34;...I, uh, it slipped my mind. Sorry?&#34;

&#34;There is nothing in this room but us, carcasses of mutated poultry and weaponry. How did it not occur to you to arm yourself?&#34;

&#34;Look, this is a stressful situation. And by the way, what are we going to do if the bodies crowd us in? They&#39;re small because we get them quick, but they&#39;ve already blocked off the door.&#34;

&#34;While we&#39;re waiting, you could always busy yourself by attempting to clear them out. The biofuel reactor could run for a week on this.&#34;

&#34;Ugh, forget I asked.&#34;

//Crickle crackle crack//

&#34;What number is this one, again?&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s classified above your level, D-&#34;
//Sqwraauuk-BLAM//

//thud//

//Barf//

&#34;-10334.&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s 3199.&#34;

&#34;Scott!&#34;

&#34;Look, he&#39;s killed enough of them that we could add him to the containment procedures. What&#39;ll knowing the number do?&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s against regulations.&#34;

&#34;So was shipping this thing out to Kansas, but some dumb bastard still did that and here we are!&#34;

&#34;We&#39;re in Kansas?&#34;

&#34;...Don&#39;t get any ideas.&#34;

&#34;Hell no. First thing I did on turnin&#39; eighteen was get the hell outta this state. Not gonna try and crawl back into it. &#39;Sides, more than a li&#39;l preoccupied.&#34;

//Crickle crackle crack//

&#34;Do y&#39;reckon I should be standin&#39; or something? Seems a mite lax, sittin&#39; down like this.&#34;

&#34;No sense in tiring yourself out. Besides, it&#39;s not as if the anomalies present a challenging target. They barely have time to-&#34;
//Sqwraauuk-BLAM//

//thud//

//Barf//

&#34;-crawl from the egg.&#34;

&#34;Feels a tad unfair, but then again I don&#39;t fancy dyin&#39; today.&#34;

&#34;Same here.&#34;

&#34;...&#34;

&#34;...&#34;

&#34;...&#34;

//Crickle crackle crack//

//Sqwraauuk-BLAM//

//thud//

//Barf//

&#34;...How long until reinforcements, again?&#34;</textarea></pre>
