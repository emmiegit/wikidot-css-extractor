+++ A Horrible Night

Upon opening his eyes, he became fixated on the scene of five people in a strange place. He didn&#39;t recognize it and judging from the facial expressions and gestures of the people, they did not, either. What seemed especially weird to him was that although he could clearly see their lips moving, he could not hear a word they said. One of the people, a woman with a dark complexion who appeared to be incredibly angry, looked like she was addressing him. He attempted to speak, to catch the group&#39;s attention, but they appeared not to hear him or were ignoring him. They continued with their conversation. He then tried moving, looking around, but he found that he could not. He could move his eyes, but not his head or the rest of his body. It was as if he was paralyzed. Focusing back on the group, it appeared they were in a large building of sorts. Perhaps an office building? It had white walls and cream-colored carpets. The place was segmented into rooms, based on the doorways he could see, but there were no doors. The room the group was in was abnormally large, and they were standing in a circle in the middle of it or appeared to be, from his view. Other than the large, angry woman, two young men who had to be twins, a small, petite, teenage girl, and a middle-aged man who kept glancing around nervously.
He was wondering what they were talking about when they all suddenly looked up, and his view tilted up as well. He became fixated on speakers located in the ceiling. Was someone speaking to them?
Their reactions as a whole started as looking confused, transitioned to anger, and then quickly flashed to...fear? Yes, he inwardly decided, they were afraid. Whatever they had heard had made them scared. The teenage girl started crying and the angry woman pressed her lips together, giving her chubby face a tight, drawn-in look. The twins were now holding each other&#39;s hands, tightly, and the nervous man appeared even more unnerved, if that was possible.
One of the twins finally started speaking. Once he finished announcing whatever he had to say, he started pulling his brother away from the group, heading into an adjoining room. The nervous man shook his head and looked toward the angry woman. His lips start moving, and after he finishes speaking, the woman bobs her head up and down, signaling a yes to whatever question is asked. He then turns to the teenage girl, who still has tears trickling down her cheeks. She finally opens her mouth and apparently hic-ups out a response. The man finally turns and directly addresses the man who is watching the group. Although he tries, he never was good at reading lips, and the meaning of the words imparted by the nervous man fails to reach him. Highly confused and worn out just from attempting to figure out what was going on, the man closes his eyes and falls asleep...
When he re-awoke he found he could still only see the same place. He was still tired, but less than he had been before. After getting his bearings, he was shocked to find it seemed he was...moving forward. This, although he was not standing nor moving his legs. He was, or at least seemed to be, rapidly approaching a turn in a hallway. His view suddenly spun around, allowing him to catch a glimpse of a figure rushing towards him. He saw it only for a second before he could see straight again and was rounding the corner. Next thing he knew, his vision was squeezing into a small sliver of a hallway and into a side room inside it that was there. He had no idea who or what had been chasing him, but just the thought of it made it seem as if there was a fist pounding in his chest. His view stayed still for several minutes, before finally panning the room. He took note of a filing cabinet against one of the walls, and a hole in the ground with a latter leading to another floor. His view moved to the side of the cabinet, which then fell forward, revealing a small doorway. He saw the back of someone, seemingly floating in the air. That, or they were tall and it was just so dark he could not see their feet. He finally recognized the person to be the nervous man. Then, the nervous man started slowly turning, but not because his legs propelled him to. His whole body was spinning around to face him, and by looking at his face, he had a sick feeling something was not right. He could tell the man&#39;s eyes were bulging even in the low light levels in the room. He blinked as the nervous man was now fully facing him...when his view suddenly cut to black. Well, not totally to black. He could make out his reflection, and barely the edges of a pillow, confirming he was in a bed. He couldn&#39;t see anything else, as it really was only a shot of his head. After several moments of nothing else of note occurring, he finally closed his eyes and went to sleep again.
The third time he woke up, he came into focus on a...frying pan...? Sure enough, it was a frying pan, although it appeared rusty and one side of it was worn down and now sharp where a piece had broken off. Some liquid was dripping from that edge. The very sight of it made him queasy, although he did not quite recognize it in the black lighting, he had a feeling he knew what it was. The pan was suddenly and violently flung away into the darkness. His sight shifted downwards, where he could make out a person lying on the ground. More liquid was pooled around their head and some were even was //on// their head. The word for the liquid suddenly entered his head: **blood**. This person was bleeding badly...but he could already tell it was too late for anyone to attempt to save the victim...there was too much bodily fluid on the ground for that. His face got closer, or so it seemed to the person lying on the ground, and that same, sick, terrible feeling filled him. He could feel a hard thumping in his chest. A pain. His heart was pounding in him, spreading the hurt throughout that area of the body. He recognized who it was on the floor...she was the teenage girl from earlier...she had been killed...This realization shook him to his core, and he felt like screaming like a child, to tremble, to do something, anything to express himself, but could not. He still could not move. Out of nowhere, he felt a sting as something pierced his arm, and then he faded, faded off to the soothing and tranquil darkness of sleep.
When he next opened his eyes, he was peering around the edge of a doorway. He was happily surprised to see one of the twins and the angry woman, both very still alive and well. But that feeling faded as he realized they appeared to be arguing. They were facing away from him, but their hand gestures were fast and the woman kept getting in the face of the twin. He could tell she had flushed a deep scarlet from where he was. He was baffled when the angry woman pushed the twin and he seemingly fell //through// the floor and disappeared. The angry woman started stumbling away from where the twin had fallen and now looked quite pale. His vision rushed to where the man had been standing, revealing a square hole barely big enough for a person to fall backward the way the twin had. He squinted down to the floor below them and could make out the twin. His eyes were fluttering, signaling he was still alive, but deep down he knew the twin wouldn&#39;t be for much longer. He could make out the neck of the twin as well, which was twisted, wrong, at a ninety-five degree...and that feeling filled him again. The angry woman had been killing these people! His sight moved towards her, and he saw she had also apparently leaned over to check on the twin. He considered her worried, even terrified look for only a moment when a wave of bitter anger filled him...her mouth was now frantically moving, quickly babbling some excuse that was falling on a pair of deaf ears. Apparently //two// sets of deaf ears, as the woman slumped to the floor, landing in a heap, without warning. Standing over and behind her now was the other twin with a sadistic grin, and in his hand was a power flashlight, which he had apparently used as a club. He seemed to be saying something gloatingly, when a familiar reddish-orange object flashed across the view of the man who was watching, and a spray and line of red appeared on the neck of the other twin. A look of shock and horror filled the twin&#39;s face, and he took a step forward...only to trip on the angry woman, falling head-first down the same hole his brother had fell into.
The man watched with growing dread as his vision turned to address the woman and a hand approached her neck. He screwed his eyes shut for a few seconds, and then steeled himself to reopen them, expecting to find the woman&#39;s neck broken. But instead, when he opened his eyes, he found the woman&#39;s neck to be in a similar and non-broken position, and the same hand from before now feeling the woman&#39;s wrist. But when the hand suddenly dropped the wrist and his view shakily backed away from the woman, he realized she too had suffered the same fate as the other people he had seen.
After a moment of staying in the same place, his view suddenly swung around, but nothing but an empty doorway could be seen. Then his field of vision spun crazily, as if struck, and landed on the floor. He faintly heard a piercing screeching noise as the terrifying face of some creature took up his view. But in the middle of the scare, his view once again cut to black and he could see his reflection. His heart was pounding again and felt as though it would burst through his rib cage. The same pounding, internal pain filled his chest from earlier, but he still could do nothing about it.
He was aware of a light source he could not see being turned on, and then his darkened reflection was being pulled away. It had only been a TV he had been viewing...? Yet still, even as this thought settled in, his heart was still booming inside him like a drum being played in a large, empty room. He felt something being put in his ear, and he heard the angry, yet familiar voice of a woman who sounded as if she had recently been crying.
&#34;I&#39;m so sorry Dad, I don&#39;t know which idiot left whatever that horror show was on...it got your heart rate up danger-ously...&#34; her voice cracked, &#34;Everything will be fine...hang in there...the doctor and nurses are coming to transport you to emergency...&#34; She trails off as several men and women surround him. He hears them speaking silently to each other as he sees the ceiling seem to blur and move behind him. One of them, a female, is giving orders based on her tone, and another, a male, mentions how the TV in his room was supposedly turned off the entire time he had been in there. Yet it all started to fade away: the voices, the ceiling, even the pain, as he fell asleep for the last time.
---------
He suddenly awoke to familiar white halls and cream-colored carpets, although he couldn&#39;t recall where he had seen the place before. In his hand was a rusty frying pan, which he was clutching tightly. He recognized it as his favorite weapon as he heard the sound of voices nearby. With a smile, he set down the frying pan to come back and retrieve later, and considered how he would set up whoever he was about to meet as he headed to the source of the noises.
----------
Meanwhile, later during the night the events at the hospital had unfolded on, the daughter of the man who had lost her father that day bid her own husband goodnight. He turns on the television, on which a familiar show plays, but he sees five different people than his father-in-law had. He decides he doesn&#39;t like the show and switches channels, but the same show is playing on there as well. He tries the news channel he normally watches, but has the same luck. He switches through several channels and finds they are all playing this show. He then attempts to turn the TV off, but it won&#39;t power down.  It being a late night, he finally decides that fate is determined he watch this show, so he settles into his couch and gets comfortable. The next day, he was found dead on the same couch, a victim of a widowmaker heart attack.
----------
Meanwhile, somewhere else in the world, someone turns on their TV to see the view of them approaching a group of five people...

I apologize if this isn&#39;t up to your standards or you did not enjoy this. I usually would have taken more time to flesh out the narrative and do more showing rather than telling, but I was rushed in finishing this and had to even request an extension. Any grammatical mistakes are due to this, as well.
In any case, have a merry Christmas.

Yes, I know this is mortally and gravely flawed and is likely to be downvoted into oblivion.
