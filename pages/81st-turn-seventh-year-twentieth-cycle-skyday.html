++++ Fifty-Second Day in the Trees

I am not certain what is wrong with me, but it is making me crazy.  I almost attacked a fellow wanderer this afternoon.

Souja had wandered ahead of us.  I was busy trying to adjust my robes to keep them on me, when I noticed she was not with us.  I saw her going around a bend, and I hurried to catch her.

When I turned the corner, I found a creature not unlike a human, but shorter, with a long, bulbous nose and hair under its chin[[footnote]] This could have been any number of creatures, from the description.  Possibly a human or near-human species.  Likely a male (humans and their relatives tend towards beardless females, though this is by no means an absolute; see Man: A Naked Jackanape by Thursday Cetema), but precise identification is impossible without more information. [[/footnote]].  It was standing over Souja, who was on her side.  It had its hand on her belly.

I did not think.  I simply loosed a growl, and started moving forward at the creature.  It gave a high-pitched scream, and dived into the bushes.  I heard it crashing through the underbrush in its haste to get away.

I looked down at Souja, who looked up at me quizzically.  It realized then that the stranger had simply been petting her.  There had been no danger to her.

Why did I react as I did?  I should not have responded so irrationally.  I acted almost as a mother brooding over her eggs.  All I could think of was that she was in danger, and I needed to protect her.

My robes ripped when I was running.  I would put on one of the others, but they are likewise too small.  How could they have all shrunk so much?  Have I gotten larger?  I had thought I had reached my full growth, but it is possible that I am having a final stretch.  I hope I do not grow too large.  No female wants a male as large as she is.

I wish I could go home.  I could visit the healer, and he would know what was wrong with me.  But I know that that is quite impossible.  For better or worse, I am in these woods until I can complete my quest.</textarea></pre>
