**Item #:** SCP-6342

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6342 presently resides in Chamber 32 at [[[SCP-6145 | Site-24]]]&#39;s Humanoid Containment Wing. SCP-6342 is to remain hooked to an IV drip at all times, and receive lessons from [[[SCP-6087 | communication specialist]]] Dr. Wilfred Newman no less than three times weekly. 

**Description:** SCP-6342 is Neville Hillcrest, a human male of British descent, currently in his late fifties. 

On 14-03-2005, SCP-6342 underwent an anomalous physical alteration. Subject&#39;s eyes, ears and mouth are no longer present, having been replaced with a layer of living skin tissue. X-ray analysis has revealed the subject&#39;s eye sockets to be sealed with solid bone, with the maxilla and mandible having fused.

Due to this condition, SCP-6342 is unable to ingest nutrients as normal, and is sustained instead through intravenous injection. As the subject has no ability to communicate, he is currently undergoing lessons in tactile sign language.

Prior to entering Foundation custody, SCP-6342 was a landlord residing in the town of Weyford, England. Notably, his transformation coincided with the murder of Jane Davies, a 29 year old tenant living in a property then owned by SCP-6342. Police determined that the victim had died from injuries inflicted by her husband, Stuart Davies, who was found to have committed suicide via drug overdose. 

Later investigation suggests Mrs. Davies had endured physical abuse from her husband for no less than eighteen months prior to her death. Research into the significance of this is ongoing.
