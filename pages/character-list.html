[[div class=&#34;oldblock&#34;]]
= The Library is accessible to countless worlds and realities, and that means the clientele are generally as varied and strange as one might expect. But some Wanderers, through action or otherwise, distinguish themselves among their peers, earning a place of notability (or notoriety) within the Library&#39;s halls. The same is true for Librarians; despite the vast majority being eldritch, silent guardians, some Volunteer Librarians are easily recognizable to the seasoned Wanderer. What follows is an abridged list of those rare few entities.
[[/div]]

[[tabview]]

[[tab Wanderers]]
[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**Professor Anton Volek:**[[/span]] A skeletal patron of the Wanderers&#39; Library with seemingly no ties to any one organization. [[[just-another-wanderer | Amicable with nearly everyone]]] he meets, he has an affinity for [[[library-shenanigans | bothering the Staff]]] at only the most inopportune times. His past is shrouded in mystery and any record of his workplace, Derosena University, was destroyed during the events of the Great Searing. He goes to great lengths to collect and compile stories in his tome, &#34;[[[Professor Volek&#39;s Compendium of Mysterious Pieces and Tales]]].&#34;
[[&gt;]]
//Why settle for the mundane when you can have the extraordinary?//
[[/&gt;]]
----
[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**Dr. Morgan James Marsh:**[[/span]] A dark sorcerer and [[[planasthai-investigative-marsh-and-greene-pt-1 | investigative reporter under the employ of Planasthai Press]]]. As quick with a pen as he is with a profane incantation, he has served as one of the publication’s most esteemed writers for decades longer than his magically-retained youth might lead one to guess. His column [[[tales-from-the-marsh-morgue-city-shuffle | Tales From the Marsh]]] provides a breezy and grounded view of extradimensional locations and goings-on that the paper’s readers do not have the arcane power to witness and survive on their own. More than a century of life spent [[[irish-coffee | nosing into other peoples’ business]]] has left Dr. Marsh with a wealth of knowledge in both arcane secrets and skullduggery, and he is generally happy to share what he knows - for the right price. (Usually bourbon.)
[[&gt;]]
//Cursebreaking, demon-slaying, necromantic and demonological consultation services available. Rates variable dependent upon challenge, soulmass, and existential risk. Inquire at Office 6, Exploratory Investigative Department, Planasthai.//
[[/&gt;]]
----
[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**Holcombe Sufwick Efferthwaighte:**[[/span]] A monochrome man whose history was lost along with his home. A criminal in name only, his time is split recklessly between the Library (where timeless amnesty and secretive nooks provide a welcome respite) and hopping between facets of reality, searching for answers and fleeing the multiverse&#39;s law enforcement. His hobbies are [[[stay-here-draw-spaceships | numerous and amateurish]]], though he&#39;s known to be fairly skilled with a quill and exceptionally bad at games of chance. Not one of his supposed transgressions has ever been shown to hold water, and the Library considers him [[[maft | wholly innocent of any wrongdoing]]].
[[&gt;]]
//Better eyes than yours have searched for him here. We&#39;ll not give him away so easily. Swallow your grievances and leave well enough alone.//
[[/&gt;]]
----
[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**Ulak the Drifter:**[[/span]] A veteran Wanderer, a stranger in strange lands, the consummate chronicler and explorer. Four-armed and wide-eyed, spends most of his time journeying through the many universes of the World Tree and writing down his every experience in [[[chronicle-of-ulak-the-drifter | his massive Chronicle]]]. Fearless and curious to a fault, will embark in quests and journeys to the most alien, awe-inspiring and lethal worlds and environments for the sake of discovery. Let his gentle ways not fool you; one does not survive in the [[[legends-of-midgard | Multiverse]]] by being meek. Though often alone in his travels, he will occasionally find himself in the company of fellow explorers, [[[xan-second-rotation-5099 |outlaws]]], occultists and every other kind of interesting people. 
[[&gt;]]
//All interactions are recorded, no secrets are kept. Travel alongside him and find yourself some adventure.//
[[/&gt;]]
----
[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**Issa Antar:**[[/span]] A seemingly-immortal scribe from [[[homeland | a long-lost civilization]]], Issa Antar just appeared amongst the stacks one day and got right to work. When asked, the wizened old man will smile and offer up a [[[worth | mostly-metaphorical tale]]], usually involving an old man on a mission. He can most often be found in the commons, collecting stories and transcribing [[[issa-author | his own]]] on endless scrolls of sun-dried papyrus.
[[&gt;]]
//Have you heard the tale of Ankhreshet and his travels through the Duat?//
[[/&gt;]]
------
[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**Archmage Mortis:**[[/span]] One of the most powerful reality-warpers in existence, Lord Mortis was once Emperor of the greatest civilization to ever grace the stars. But the [[[peace-for-our-time | burden of responsibility]]]  demands more than what can be done with a crown or a throne, and Lord Mortis has seen it fit to shed both. Armed with the deepest secrets of magic, the Archmage wages a one-man war against the [[[i-faust | forces of chaos]]], a neverending struggle to preserve the peace and prosperity of the Immortal Empire. No cost is too high, [[[yud-first-rotation-5099 | no sacrifice is too great]]]: Lord Mortis fights, the Empire prevails. May he triumph in his crusade; Creation itself might depend on it.
[[&gt;]]
//Forever just, forever strong. Vouch for peace, prepare for war.//
[[/&gt;]]
----
[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**Eighth Gatekeeper, Lochan:**[[/span]] Once the omnipotent gatekeeper to [[[nearer-my-death-to-thee | a grand city]]], Lochan fled its post after being chided by Death and sought refuge within the Library&#39;s halls. Reduced to a being of uncertainty, it now lurks in the rafters of the Library, or wanders, itself forgotten, through worlds and realms alike. While impossibly difficult to get a hold of, records of it [[[the-gatekeeper-s-sketchbook | leaving artistic diagrams behind]]] can be found within the halls. Occasionally, it will also comment on [[[the-bibliovores | the state of affairs]]] within the Library itself, but those who see it have no conclusive response on what the Gatekeeper now appears as. 
[[&gt;]]
//Do worlds cease to exist when the last person to remember, forgets?//
[[/&gt;]]
----
[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**Uncertainty:**[[/span]] One of the many [[[field-guide-to-the-shelves-volume-one#toc7 | masked canines]]] within the Library&#39;s halls, Uncertainty stands out from his brethren by being the oldest of his species. While not the [[[the-gatekeeper-s-room | the nicest of creatures]]], Uncertainty is loyal to his creator, the Gatekeeper, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-library-cries-in-ultramarine-blue until the end of times.] He can often be found searching the halls for [[[the-gatekeeper-s-sketchbook | his creator&#39;s sketchbook]]], or, when especially bored, [[[in-finite | his creator itself.]]] 
[[&gt;]]
//Me? Give you a quote to use for your... what? Article? List? Not a chance. Now scram.//
[[/&gt;]]
----
[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**Parcoon:**[[/span]] A strange amalgamation of creatures, this fat little furball has caused [[[parcoon-finds-a-snack | quite the ruckus]]] within the halls of the Library. Attempts at finding Parcoon&#39;s owner have been unsuccessful, but he seems to have found some [[[library-rat | new friends]]] within the Library to keep himself company in the meantime. Documentations of the creature&#39;s whereabouts, as well as a few warnings regarding concerning behavior, have been [[[field-guide-to-the-shelves-volume-one#toc5 | noted down extensively]]] and are to be shared with other Patrons.
[[&gt;]]
//i am just....... a lil creacher. haf big tummy... you haf food for me?//
[[/&gt;]]
-----
[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**Duke Gathers:**[[/span]] A highly unesteemed [[[fear-and-loathing-in-the-wanderers-library | journalist and drug connoisseur]]], this chameleon&#39;s harsh, uncompromising reporting has made his relationship with the industry sour at best. Loud-mouthed and armed solely with his wits (and sometimes with his gun), he will embark on drug-fueled rampages against The Man, no matter what face He wears. Governments, [[[decadent-and-depraved | concert organizers]]] and the press itself better watch their backs: there is no power or editor who can escape [[[a-world-of-dogs | his typewriter&#39;s wrath]]].
[[&gt;]]
//I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity to anyone, but they&#39;ve always worked for me.//
[[/&gt;]]
-----
[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**Gottsam R&#39;lek:**[[/span]] A humanoid praying mantis with a penchant for fashionable scarves and colored glasses, this Planasthai staple is the other side to Duke Gathers&#39; coin.  He writes to wow and amaze the reader, with [[[the-multi-unitraversal | exotic universes]]] and unsolved mysteries.  He believes people don&#39;t need the extra stress, and wants to offer a reprieve from the outside world.  The mantis can be [[[rebate-and-resentment-at-backdoor-soho | self-centered]]] and a people pleaser, but he truly does care for his job, and even more so for his fans.  Don&#39;t be fooled, because despite his lavish demeanor, he&#39;s ready for a [[[cont-on-pg-13 | quick retort]]] or to find a way to one-up his challengers.
[[&gt;]]
//Honestly, what would you do without me?//
[[/&gt;]]

------

[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**Aníbal Žalost:**[[/span]] Real name Aníbal Salazar, Žalost is Lord Mortis&#39; apprentice and main enforcer, a young warlock who dabbles in [[[dark-science | techno-sorcery and body augmentation]]]. His mastery of necromancy and demonology is unquestionable, but his thirst for knowledge and his ruthlessness often have [[[at-tannhauser-gate | dire consequences]]] for those around him. Wanderers beware: one never knows what [[[dim-dreams | dim dreams]]] lie behind his shadowed eyes.
[[&gt;]]
//Relax. You look like you just saw the Devil.//
[[/&gt;]]
------
[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**Nayáhuari:**[[/span]] A brutal contract killer and bounty hunter, Nayáhuari has carved herself a reputation as the best the Guild of Assassins has to offer. Feared even by her peers and willing to take virtually any target [[[a-conspiracy-of-five | for the right amount]]], she has expanded her hunting grounds to every corner of the known Universe, fueled by an unyielding thirst for money and [[[misotheism-part-one | more challenging kills]]]. One would be well-advised to never fully trust her, for [[[conclave | this assassin&#39;s allegiance]]] is to herself and coin alone.  
[[&gt;]]
//Of course I know your worth! It&#39;s why I&#39;m putting two between your eyes!//
[[/&gt;]]
-----
[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**Corbenic Leander Atlas:**[[/span]] An egnimatic and rarely-seen wanderer, C. L. Atlas spends most of his time [[[https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/why-we-wander | following the stories of those who can no longer speak for themselves.]]]  Boasting investigative skills to match his colossal frame, Atlas uses his formidable combination of brains and brawn to brave the [[[https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/cold-mornings | highest peaks]]] in an attempt to uncover stories lost to time.  A skilled warlock, mountaineer, engineer, and storyteller, Atlas is more than prepared for [[[http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/encounters-in-the-deep-wood | any situation]]] that may come his way.
[[&gt;]]
//I’m looking for information. To whom do I owe the pleasure?//
[[/&gt;]]
-----
[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**Basar:**[[/span]] A former jailor who in his retirement, ended up making a home for himself in the Library. How exactly he ended up with a library card is a [[[library-card-part-two |mystery to even the Archivists]]], but since he spends his days [[[a-cold-moon-sets-on-the-shelves |defending the Library]]] or [[[the-bibliovores |helping solve its mysteries]]], they turn a blind eye to it. 
[[&gt;]]
//Please, forgive me for my past. Is there something I can help you with today?//
[[/&gt;]]

[[/tab]]

[[tab Librarians]]
[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**The Rounderpede:**[[/span]] A massive, insectoid creature of unknown length currently serving as the [[[the-rounderpede-s-nest | Chief Archivist of the Wanderer&#39;s Library]]]. The Rounderpede predates most modern Wanderers -- the story goes that it stumbled into the Library from parts unknown during a period of great decay and inactivity, and, filled with a sense of purpose it had forgotten, set about bringing its new home back to life. It quickly earned the loyalty of the slumbering Librarians and found itself in the position of maintaining the rapidly-growing Library. Nowadays, most Wanderers can spot the seemingly-infinite creature hanging from the rafters or skittering between shelves, [[[library-shenanigans | always busy with the task of keeping an infinite library in working order]]]. But should one approach, they&#39;ll find the hard carapace hides a deeply inquisitive, slightly offbeat, very sharp mind that [[[irish-coffee | cares strongly about its friends]]] and its home.
[[&gt;]]
//Come closer, Wanderer! Don&#39;t let the pincers fool you, I don&#39;t bite... wait, you&#39;re not a Jailor, are you?//
[[/&gt;]]
----
[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**Malaise:**[[/span]] Malaise was born in an ocean far away, in a land even he does not remember. A young, lonely octopus, he one day strayed too far from the nest and into a riptide that carried him through the sea, into a way, and deposited him into the Library. Although he could not read at the time, a helpful Docent trained in the language of tentacles was able to slowly teach him the basics.  Malaise began to read voraciously, hoping that the books might give him the secret to returning home, but sadly they only granted immense magical power and incredibly in-depth knowledge of the workings of the multiverse. He accepted the promotion to Archivist hoping that the additional privileges might reveal where he once lived, but alas, has had no luck. Now most of his time is spent drinking and yelling at anyone foolish enough to ask him for help, with his only confidant being the Docent kind enough to treat him as friend, the creature once known as Ronaldo.
[[&gt;]]
//God, that was the best coral reef ever... I could swim for miles undisturbed and the clams were delicious... what? Rounderpede wants me to sort section 71A-13K? Bring some more beer and tell him I&#39;m busy.//
[[/&gt;]]
----
[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**Sqr&#39;lk:**[[/span]] An elderly scholar, adventurer and [[[descent-into-the-necropolis-of-atun-katur | spacefarer]]]. Brilliant, but impulsive to a fault, this goblin has spent centuries trying to prove that he is more than his ears and teeth after escaping his homeland via a self-made rocketship. Years of scouring space and the multiverse in search of strange creatures and arcane knowledge, often accompanied by his most trusted companion, a phoenix of cosmic origins, has filled [[[the-bibliovores | several shelves of the Library]]] and left an impression of his name in the academic circles within. And old as he may be, his [[[a-cold-moon-sets-on-the-shelves | pursuit of adrenaline]]] won&#39;t be stopped by nothing less than death. 
[[&gt;]]
//Adventure awaits!//
[[/&gt;]]
----
[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**Ayman and Owlpede:**[[/span]] A pair of Archivists who always seem to be at the [[[owlpedes-disaster-scrapbook |forefront of mischief within the Library]]], much to Ayman&#39;s dismay. Stationed at a desk together, [[[library-card-part-two |the two are always seen bickering]]], but never ask to transfer. It seems they will [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-library-cries-in-ultramarine-blue stick together until the end], and use their vastly differing personalities to [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/component:stolen-theme solve the Library&#39;s greatest of challenges]. 
[[&gt;]]
//Till death do us part.//
[[/&gt;]]
[[/tab]]

[[tab Other Characters]]
[[span class=&#34;emphasis&#34;]]**The Serpent:**[[/span]] A legendary serpentine entity said to dwell in the lowest foundations of the Library. Very little is concretely known about the Serpent, including whether it even exists. What //is// known is that the entity seems to be a primordial force or symbol for knowledge. The more religious suggest that it is the same Serpent that appears time and time again throughout history as the [[[sins-of-the-mother | Snake in the Garden of Eden]]], Jörmungandr, the Rainbow Snake, Shesha, and [[[the-three-kings | countless others]]] -- others also suggest that the Library was in fact created by the Serpent at the beginning of time. Some Wanderers who have ventured into the Foundations and come back alive claim to have in fact met and [[[conversations-with-the-serpent | even spoken to it]]], but these stories are unconfirmed. Nowadays, the Serpent is perhaps best known as the symbol of the group known as the Serpent&#39;s Hand -- some among them claim to receive visions of the creature in its nest below the Library but these claims are, again, unsubstantiated.
[[&gt;]]
//The Garden is the Serpent&#39;s place.//
