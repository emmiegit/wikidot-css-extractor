++++ **__Special Containment Procedures__**

The town of Old River is to be constantly monitored by aerial CCTV to detect any non-Foundation/non-G.O.C personnel nearby to avoid unauthorized visuals or entry. In addition, a designated 30 kilometers no-fly zone is to be placed around Old River. If the chance of a civilian aircraft is seen spotting Old River, they are to safely land on a newly built Coalition-owned runway nearby, where all pilots and passengers shall be promptly detained.
----

++++ **__Description__**
 
SCP-6973 is a gray cloud similar to a human skull that appears above Old River, a rural village located in **West Siberia**. The origin of SCP-6973 is still currently unknown; however, periodically, SCP-6973 will release drops of verdant-colored vapor, conveying tears, and will resume enclosing Old River.

SCP-6973&#39;s creation is a hemisphere [[footnote]] Measured to be 273 meters in height and 13.4 meters in diameter.[[/footnote]] consisting of an unknown gas,[[footnote]] Now referred to as SCP-6973-2. [[/footnote]] completely covering Old River. Personnel who have scanned SCP-6973-2 we&#39;re greeted with a substantial amount of radiation. Any personnel inside the designated radiation zones and are not equipped with appropriate attire will begin to experience symptoms of high radiation intake, such as high fevers, fatigue, disorientation, nausea, death, et cetera. Although, these symptoms vary depending on how near the victim is located to SCP-6973-2.

Deceased residents of Old River that were affected by SCP-6973-2 (referred to as SCP-6973-2-A) were reported that their corpses were reanimated, speaking Russian in reverse. In addition, some repeatedly recite prayers to SCP-6973, labeling it &#34;The Eye.&#34;

----

++++ **__Discovery__**

In 2026, SCP-6973-2 was founded by the Russian Airborne Forces during one of their parachute landing training. After locating SCP-6973-2, the current Russian leader, Alexei Anatolievich Navalny, approved top-secret investigations on SCP-6973-2. When the Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition were later informed, the Russian government agreed to allow both powers to contribute to their research. 

The Global Occult Coalition and the Russian government were assigned to find methods for the neutralization of SCP-6973. However, All attempts were futile.

The Foundation was assigned to SCP-6973-2, learning how to eliminate and understand its anomalous properties. However, due to all members of Beta-7 being preoccupied with an assignment at the time;  the CBRN Recon unit, [[[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/gas-gas-gas | Mu-10]]],[[footnote]] Code name: &#34;Gas Giants.&#34; [[/footnote]] was banded and was dispatched to the area. 

Unfortunately, when Mu-10 were extracted from the SCP-6973-2, they reported finding nothing that could aid the eradication of SCP-6973-2, and one agent&#39;s leg was fractured and his vocal cords damaged after his confrontation with one instance of SCP-6973-2-A. He is currently being treated in a Foundation medical center.

++++ **__Addendum__**

After several unsuccessful neutralization attempts, SCP-6973 was nowhere to be seen for the entirety of the month of September. A few weeks after, videos and photos of SCP-6973 were posted on multiple websites. [[footnote]] These include well-known sites such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, et cetera. [[/footnote]] After these multiple occurrences caught the attention of the G.O.C and the Foundation. The G.O.C advised countries to send out announcements related to SCP-6973 as simply coincidences. 

However, if these announcements are quickly deemed obsolete, countries are to release a PSA/EAS about the dangers of SCP-6973. At this time, the G.O.C is preparing nuclear shelters for the possibility of an  
 [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/k-class-complete-list |&#34;XK-Class End-of-the-World Scenario.&#34;]]]

Briefly after, the G.O.C and the Foundation representatives scheduled to have a conference at Site-267. During the meeting, Director Wurfs gave a short speech through the intercom.

**Note:** //&#34;I don&#39;t-- We don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening at the moment. For years, we&#39;ve been successful at getting rid of anomalies this catastrophic, and it has worked every single time. But now...? Not so much. We&#39;re trying our very hardest, but... I guess our hardest wasn&#39;t, uh... was not enough, sadly.//

//I&#39;m afraid to say it -- and I can not say this unprofessionally enough -- but if we don&#39;t get rid of this problem fast, we are screwed. F-U-C-K-E-D, screwed. Now, I know I may be overreacting, and I&#39;m trying to stay calm about it, but we don&#39;t have many options except for preparing for the absolute worst to come. Maybe praying&#39;s involved if it gets to that point.//

//To the Coalition... we must put aside our differences and pay attention to the greater threat above our heads right this moment. We don&#39;t have much time left, people. It&#39;s do-or-die, and knowing how far we as humans have come, from rock to steel, we don&#39;t have much time for dying....&#34;// -- Director Wurfs

++++ **__Addendum-2__**

In **Birštonas**, **Lithuania**, SCP-6973 was seen producing SCP-6973-2 and began releasing it into the town. In 1-2 hours, SCP-6973-2 completely covered Birštonas causing significant trepidation around Eurasia. A few days after the incident, SCP-6973 attacked **As Sulayyil**, a city located in **Saudi Arabia**.

The number of casualties is currently unknown, but the presumed estimation is possibly in the thousands.

++++ **__Update__** 

Aerial CCTV caught an unknown individual on horseback witnessing SCP-6973-2. After following the individual, they reached a small hut. The suspect was later detained and was sent to Site-267 for interrogation. See the translated version of **Interrogation Log - 10/20/26** below.

//Because Agent ███████, a member of Mu-10, was present during the events in Old River and is capable of speaking Russian; she will be the interrogator.//

**Date: 10/20/26**

**Suspect:** Unknown

**Interrogator:** Agent ███████

**Foreword:** Agent ███████ enters the interrogation room.

----

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

//[Agent ███████ sits down.]//

**Unknown:** What is this place? I have never seen such technology so... prosperous.

**Agent ███████:** Yeah... that&#39;s 2026 for you, I guess. But don&#39;t worry about it too much.

**Unknown:** &#34;2026,&#34; you say...? I must ask, why do you hold me here?

**Agent ███████:** It&#39;s about what you saw.

**Unknown:** &#34;About what I--?&#34; Oh... of course.

**Agent ███████:** We need your help. 

**Unknown:** My help...? I can not.

**Agent ███████:** What do you mean you &#34;can not?&#34; People are dying.

**Unknown:** If they die, they die. I am not in control of what the Eye does.

**Agent ███████:** So you do know about what&#39;s going on. Is this Eye some type of, uh... I don&#39;t know, like, a deity to you?

//[Unknown remains silent.]//

**Agent ███████:** Come on, old man, just say it. You got, like, five teeth in your goddamn head so use them.

**Unknown:** Watch that tongue of yours, woman. Besides, you&#39;re not too young yourself. I&#39;ve seen trees more good-looking than you.

**Agent ███████:** At least I don&#39;t have a lazy eye. Look like a damn chameleo--

//[Intercom turns on.]//

**Intercom:** //[In English.]// Mrs. Park, stop insulting him and stay on topic. Please stop wasting time.

**Agent ███████:** //[In English.]// All right, cool, I got it. My bad.

**Unknown:** What was that voice? 

**Agent ███████:** //[In Russian.]// It&#39;s nothing. That is just one of our examples of &#34;prosperous technology.&#34;

**Unknown:** Hmm... //[Mumbles.]// and I thought we had it good.

//[Silence.]//

**Agent ███████:** Look, we got on the wrong foot. Let&#39;s try again: what&#39;s your name, anyway?

**Unknown:** Abraham.

**Agent ███████:** Last name?

**Mr. Ivanov:** Ivanov.

**Agent ███████:** Really, &#34;Ivanov?&#34; That sounds familiar.

**Mr. Ivanov:** Then you probably knew my son.

**Agent ███████:** Was his name Ivanov also?

**Mr. Ivanov:** That was his surname. His first name was Isaac.

**Agent ███████:** What happened to your son?

**Mr. Ivanov:** He has... he has perished. But that was long, long ago. 

**Agent ███████:** &#34;Perished?&#34; How did he die?

//[Mr. Ivanov remains silent.]//

**Agent ███████:** Mm... I&#39;m going to leave that alone for now. Let&#39;s get straight to the point: this &#34;Eye&#34; thing you call it. What exactly is it?

**Mr. Ivanov:** I do not know.

**Agent ███████:** Well, can you tell me when it came to your town?

**Mr. Ivanov:** //[Sighs.]// ...When we were at our lowest, in the deepest pits of despair, our desperation for someone to save us was growing every hour. All were hopeless until a man named Artyom came to our village.

**Agent ███████:** &#34;Artyom.&#34;

**Mr. Ivanov:** Yes, &#34;Artyom.&#34; A charming, well-dressed man, he was. When he came, he walked to the fountain and lectured us about how he was the savior we had been waiting upon. Of course, we didn&#39;t believe him at first. When he finished his speech, he pointed to a hill and pledged to build a church there in one night. And--

**Agent ███████:** And in the morning, the church was there.

**Mr. Ivanov:** Indeed. Just like he said, it was there before sunrise. After proving his worth, he pointed to the sky, revealing the Eye in its true glory, and told us all our problems would vanish if we kept our promise.

**Agent ███████:** What promise...?

//[Mr. Ivanov remains silent.]//

**Agent ███████:** What was it...? Ivanov, what kind of promise did you make to that man?

**Mr. Ivanov:** ...That to give up our youth and the naive for decades.

**Agent ███████:** Youth and naive? So you&#39;re saying...? No.

**Mr. Ivanov:** //[Sighs.]// Yes. A sickening action: sacrifice. But we had no choice. It was a terrible season for us all. Everyone was either sick, hungry, or dead. 

**Agent ███████:** Did it even work?

**Mr. Ivanov:** Of course. Our first sacrifice was a boy, already mourned by the villagers but still alive. Artyom told us to bring him to the church and place him on the altar table. When the task was fulfilled, Artyom grabbed hold of a dagger. Few people were outraged by the thought of doing something so... vicious. But, in the end, they were subdued by the majority that wanted to survive. He--

**Agent ███████:** What did you think?

**Mr. Ivanov:** Hmm... I was disgusted by the idea of it, but I wasn&#39;t against it, in a way. To remind you, I hav-- had a son. Sometimes you have to do things you aren&#39;t proud of. Hopefully, you can understand.

**Agent ███████:** No... I-I don&#39;t. But I do know one man I worked with that did. He had a daughter... surprisingly.

**Mr. Ivanov:** &#34;Had?&#34;  Is she also...?

**Agent ███████:** I think so. He didn&#39;t talk about her a lot to me, and he wasn&#39;t very... well, pleasant to be around at first, but he opened up later on.

**Mr. Ivanov:** Mm. I hope all is well with him.

**Agent ███████:** He&#39;s all right. He&#39;s in the hospital for being a dumb idiot, but he&#39;s well. But let&#39;s not talk about that any further.

**Mr. Ivanov:** //[Chuckles.]// Very well.

**Agent ███████:** Ok. So did he kill the kid? Artyom?

**Mr. Ivanov:** Yes... he-he cut open his flesh, revealing the organs inside the poor boy. We all watched in horror as Artyom grabbed his inside out of his body and placed them inside a pot, powerless to stop him due to our desperation. &#34;This will make it easier for his soul to reach the Eye,&#34; he told us. 

**Agent ███████:** Awful.

**Mr. Ivanov:** Mm. A terrible... terrible, terrible way to leave this world, but it had to be done. And in the end, it was worth the loss. Everything changed the following day: there was pure water from the stream, meatier beasts roamed the plains, never departing, and the soil we kept was richer; therefore, our crops grew in haste. Finally, the greatest gift of them all was that all the disease, the aliments, the blemishes on our own faces disappeared entirely. All these blessings were from the Eye itself.

**Agent ███████:** Impressive.

**Mr. Ivanov:** Indeed. We glorified Artyom, and he became the pastor of the church. He //lived// among us for only a few days before disappearing one morning.

**Agent ███████:** Did he ever return?

**Mr. Ivanov:** Yes. Many months passed, and he came back as he did before, asking for us to give the Eye another offering, and we did. A newborn was offered, and we continued to live peacefully.

**Agent ███████:** Mm-hmm. So when does Artyom come to your town?

**Mr. Ivanov:** It is when newborns are conceived: 9 months. An odd man he was. Handsome but hideous in many aspects.

**Agent ███████:** Really? You seem to not like him very much.

**Mr. Ivanov:** I never liked him to begin with. All the things that he&#39;s done in our town: making us vote for whoever we should kill, plaguing our minds with his beliefs, so much that we became brainwashed, killing my Isaac. We were beyond redemption. 

**Agent ███████:** Your son was a sacrifice?

**Mr. Ivanov:** Yes... I-I pleaded to them not to kill him, but Artyom insisted because he was the only child that was still left. Through stubbornness, Isaac and I tried to flee the already wretched town, but they caught us before we could reach the bridge. As punishment, they imprisoned me, but before doing that, they...

**Agent ███████:** They, what...?

**Unknown:** Before imprisoning me, they-- they, uh... //[Sighs.]// we were brought to the church, and Isaac was held down on the table, stripping of few of his attire. They later dragged me to him. Artyom came from behind, holding a dagger.

**Agent ███████:** //[In English.]// //[Mutters.]// Ah, Christ. 

**Mr. Ivanov:** I-I&#39;m sorry...?

**Agent ███████:** //[In Russian]// No, uh, nothing... you don&#39;t have to, uh, talk about it if you don&#39;t want to. I think I know where this is going, sadly.

**Mr. Ivanov:** No, no, I&#39;m-- I need you to know how... //depraved// that man is. For years, I&#39;ve been living there, always willing to help for the betterment of Old River, but they just... they just discarded me like a toy no longer bringing joy to its handler. Still being constrained, Artyom guided himself to Isaac&#39;s stomach and began... plunging it... pushing it inside him. Tearing his skin, I heard puffs of air escaping his body. They covered his mouth, but I could hear my son&#39;s muffled cries of agony, knowing there was... //[Sighs.]// nothing I could do. Artyom was grinning through it all, taking Isaac&#39;s pieces out of him and smearing them on my hands, face, my clothes. 

**Agent ███████:** Wow... //[Sighs.]// I really don&#39;t know what to say, except I&#39;m sorry that happened to you and your son.

**Mr. Ivanov:** I do not need your pity. There is nothing to be sorry about. The past is the past. You must move on... even though it hurts.

**Agent ███████:** Mm... what did they do to you after?

**Mr. Ivanov:** They imprisoned me by locking me away in an abandoned pigsty, still having fresh blood all over me. They kept me there, only letting me out just to ridicule me by forcing me into useless labor. 

**Agent ███████:** For how long?

**Mr. Ivanov:** For years. They almost drove me to insanity from the isolation, but the work made it bearable. But it didn&#39;t last, of course. Not after //it// came.

**Agent ███████:** &#34;It?&#34; The Eye?

**Mr. Ivanov:** Yes... it was the month of giving. Except... there was nothing to give. Hearing gossip, women demanded of a child have died during labor, along with the infant dying in their wombs. that day, they gave nothing to it. Only lying lips.

**Agent ███████:** I guess they had it coming.

**Mr. Ivanov:** Indeed. Gradually, the Eye became more unpleasant. Its month has passed, and it turned grey, blocking the daylight, denying crops to grow. The water, the air, and the ground we walked on was plagued by a green mist coming from the Eye. The creatures that were once thriving off the land were now gone. Thunder bellowed, and lightning struck their homes, including the pigsty falling victim to it, causing it to burn. A few noticed and were kind enough to let me free instead of turning me to ashes. Maybe they wanted me to suffer a bit longer. 

**Agent ███████:** Yeah, well... did they put you somewhere else?

**Mr. Ivanov:** No, not this time. They were so worried about what was occurring around them that they all rushed to the church, leaving me the opportunity to escape. 

**Agent ███████:** We saw a body on the table. Why didn&#39;t that work?

**Mr. Ivanov:** For there were no children to give to the Eye. There was no hope for them, some realizing the fact faster than others. 

**Agent ███████:** Oh. Well, we didn&#39;t see Artyom there. I--

**Mr. Ivanov:** That&#39;s because he&#39;s a coward.

**Agent ███████:** Right. He--

//[Intercom turns on.]//

**Intercom:** //[In English.]// Mrs. Park, end the conversation. it just got Ecuador. We got what we needed.

**Agent ███████:** //[In English.]// //[Mutters.]// Oh, Jesus, not Ecuador!

//[Agent ███████ stands up.]//

**Agent ███████:** I&#39;m sorry, Abraham, but I need to get goin&#39;. It&#39;s, uh, it&#39;s urgent.

**Mr. Ivanov:** Hmm?

**Agent ███████:** Oh-- //[In Russian.]// I-I have to go, Abraham. I--

**Mr. Ivanov:** Wait, before you leave. Was Isaac buried?

**Agent ███████:** What?

**Mr. Ivanov:** I want to know if they still buried him. I was the one who came up with the idea of leaving, not him. Even though Old River turned... sinister. it was still our home.

**Agent ███████:** //[Sighs.]// Man... yeah... yes, they treated him right.

**Mr. Ivanov:** I&#39;m... thank you... but please hurry and put an end to that thing. The Eye will not be merciful during the day of reckoning... the day of retribution.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

++++ **__Update__**

A juvenile D-Class was later terminated inside the church of Old River, using the instructions given by Mr. Ivanov. After the instructions were met, SCP-6973 was seen vanishing by stationed G.O.C personnel in multiple locations. In a span of 2 days, all instances of SCP-6973-2 began to reduce in size, later disappearing entirely. Instances of SCP-6973-2-A, no longer being contained by SCP-6973-2, were found in a comatose state, still showing signs of life due to their irregular breathing patterns.

The retrieval of all instances of SCP-6973-2-A was quickly authorized.

++++ **__Updated Special Containment Procedures__**

Juvenile D-Class, supplied by [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1680 | SCP-████]]] are to be terminated in the church of Old River for sacrificial purposes on a nonamesteral [[footnote]] Term for nine months. [[/footnote]] basis or whenever SCP-6973 is active. CBRN agents that are a part of the G.O.C. are stationed at Old River at all times and must wear CBRN MOPP 4 suit whenever a sacrifice is not provided. 

However, due to the recent shortage of D-Class from SCP-████, 05-Command granted approval to resort to //additional// alternatives if SCP-████ fails.
