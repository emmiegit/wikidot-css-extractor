**Item #:** SCP-048-J

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to its prevalence in public society, no method has proven effective in fully containing SCP-048-J. Rumors are to be disseminated to the public that the use of SCP-048-J is &#34;bad luck&#34; to discourage the continuation of its use. This is to be accomplished through word of mouth and by representing SCP-048-J in a negative light in mass media. All Foundation employees are to be alerted to the true nature of SCP-048-J and requested to minimize or fully cease its use in their speech and writing.

**Description:** SCP-048-J is a set of anomalous phrases which, when spoken or written, will cause manipulation of probability in the user&#39;s vicinity. These shifts in probability are universally detrimental to the user or the completion of the user&#39;s objectives, and to any factors or individuals that may have been directly beneficial to the user. SCP-048-J consists primarily of the phrase &#34;T█████ c██&#39;█ g██ a██ w████&#34; but variations of this phrase also seem to activate SCP-048-J&#39;s probability manipulation effect.

**Addendum 1:** //Example of SCP-048-J&#39;s use. Audio sample from the Site-██ containment breach on ██/██/████.//


&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Leon Red:** [panting] Are they still behind us?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Paulus Shirt:** No, I-I think we outran them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Red:** Nasty little buggers, aren&#39;t they?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shirt:** Yeah, I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll find us in here though.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Red:** Aw, who are you kidding? If they don&#39;t find us, something worse will. We&#39;re good as dead already unless the reinforcements get here in time.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shirt:** Come on. Okay, so maybe we&#39;re stuck in the middle of a containment breach. And maybe we won&#39;t make it out. And maybe we&#39;re cut off from everyone else on the site. But look on the bright side! At least [SCP-048-J]
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Red:** No! You idiot! You&#39;re never supposed to say-
&gt; 
&gt; **Site-██ Automated Announcement System:** {{ATTENTION ALL PERSONNEL. [[[SCP-008]]] HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT. [[[SCP-096]]] HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT. [[[SCP-106]]] HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT. [[[SCP-173]]] HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT. [[[SCP-682]]] HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT. [[[SCP-2317]]] HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT. [DATA EXPUNGED] HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT.}}
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Red:** You just //had// to say it, didn&#39;t you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Shirt:** You don&#39;t honestly think that that happened because I said &#34;[SCP-048-J]&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **[DATA EXPUNGED]:** [[span style=&#34;font-family: Comic Sans MS;&#34;]][[size 175%]]**//Found you.//**[[/size]][[/span]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Agents Red and Shirt:** //AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!//
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** In the ensuing containment breach, Site-██ was destroyed, a total of ████ anomalies breached containment, and all █,███,███,███ on-site personnel were killed. Agent Paulus Shirt has been issued a posthumous reprimand.

**Addendum 2:** //Log from the Area-███ break room.//


&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Joseph Shmoe:** Morning █████.
&gt; 
&gt; **Security Agent █████ Wolf:** Hey Joe, how&#39;s your morning been?
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Shmoe:** Not too good. The wife just filed for divorce.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Wolf:** Hm. Sorry to hear that.
&gt; 
&gt; **Junior Researcher Shmoe:** Yeah, and that&#39;s on top of a bunch of other stuff. This day literally can&#39;t get an- [At this point in the recording Junior Researcher Shmoe has his head shot off by Agent Wolf.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Wolf:** Don&#39;t you //ever// say that!
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Agent Wolf has been awarded the Foundation Gold Star for bravery in the face of danger and for averting the containment breach of SCP-048-J. Research into Junior Researcher Shmoe&#39;s past revealed that he was, in fact, a sleeper agent for the Chaos Insurgency who was meant to sabotage Foundation operations using SCP-048-J.

**Addendum 3:** On █/█/████, the second form of SCP-048-J was discovered and designated SCP-048-J-2. SCP-048-J-2 consists of the phrase &#34;W███ c████ p███████ g█ w████?&#34; When spoken by an individual involved in an experiment or project involving an SCP object, it will invariably cause the failure of the endeavor and large-scale collateral damage, often with far-reaching consequences. The negative effects of SCP-048-J-2 appear to be multiplied exponentially if the user has been previously advised against carrying out the endeavor.
