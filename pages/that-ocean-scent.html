I laid down on my comfortable mattress with an incurable headache and a need for sleep. Yes, I may have slept for seventeen hours, but that doesn&#39;t matter. I still have a need for sleep.

I&#39;m tired. 

I got these drugs from the local pharmacy. I didn&#39;t want to go to the doctor, so I just went on WebMD. I decided I needed some antidepressants or a boost of vitamins. It would make me feel better. Almost anything would make me feel better. 

I looked over at the nightstand. On top of it laid my lamp which I&#39;ve owned for three years now. It broke a couple weeks ago, and so it didn&#39;t display any source of light. But that&#39;s okay. I&#39;m used to the darkness, anyway.

Beneath the lamp were the tablets. They came in an aesthetically pleasing casing, labeled //**Bahamas**//.

I hesitated but then I sat up, moving my legs to dangle off of the side of the bed so I could face my nightstand. I took the pack in my hands, opening the packaging delicately. 

There were twelve in plastic packaging. The light hurt my eyes a little bit. I guess it had been a while since I went outside. I wasn&#39;t used to it.

I opened the packaging and held one of the capsules in my hand, examining it. It was beautiful. And number one went in.

-----

I woke up on the second day feeling energetic. I looked to the alarm clock: //5:43 A.M.//, it read in a digital font. I went to open the blinds and realized that there wasn&#39;t any light outside. It was alright, though! I was sure to gain some sunlight today.

I went over to my laptop, opening up Google and typing in //plane tickets to the Bahamas.// 

A vacation is what I needed, right? It would make me feel better. Plus, I&#39;d never been. New experiences are always good.

I ended up seeing an absolute steal of a deal regarding plane tickets, so I clicked it without hesitation. 

I got up from my office desk, walking downstairs. The walls were so bland. They could use some decorating rather than being painted this dull gray. I needed something to make my abode more appealing in a visual sense.

I poured myself some cereal. I decided I wanted it dry today, and I could simply go with a side of OJ. 

I hopped in the shower after that and got ready for today. It was the start of my paid vacation, so I was going to make it count!

I watched Saturday morning cartoons until it was about eight, and then I went outside to greet everyone.

&#34;Hello, Mr. Walker!&#34; I shouted from the opposite side of the street.

Mr. Walker looked over, a puzzled expression on his face. &#34;Oh! Good morning, Mr. Jameson!&#34; 

I started to walk over, noticing the beautiful way he had decorated his front yard garden. &#34;I like the decorations,&#34; I said as I stepped onto his porch. He was sitting in a wonderfully constructed, green lawn chair, with another one which remained vacant next to him. &#34;Mind if I take a seat?&#34;

&#34;Why, of course! Make yourself at home out here.&#34;

&#34;Again, Mr. Walker, your decorations are absolutely amazing.&#34;

&#34;Thank you. I certainly took my time with them.&#34;

&#34;I can tell. It&#39;s stunning. I love the coloration.&#34;

&#34;Again, thank you.&#34;

He invited me for dinner that day. I went, and it was wonderful! Delicious turkey with sides of anything you could ever imagine. It could be mistaken that they were preparing for Thanksgiving.

But, I had to leave a bit early. Tomorrow was going to be a busy day. I needed to catch a plane in the morning. I thanked Mr. Walker and walked to my house.

I packed my things and placed them all in a suitcase, as to which I left in my room. Once I was done, I laid down on my bed with a smile I couldn&#39;t get off.

And number two went in.

-----

The plane ride was quite the experience. The flight attendants were so kind! I couldn&#39;t wait to get to my hotel. 

About four hours later, I arrived at the //Sunny Skies Hotel,// which was absolutely appraised by locals for being the best five-star hotel around. 

**//That ocean scent.//** It was wonderful, and it filled the open air. My nostrils were wide open, able to comprehend and enjoy every particle of ocean breeze that gracefully entered and exited my lungs. 

I got to my hotel room. //555,// the sign outside it read. Hah, not today, Devil! The sun&#39;s too kind for me to rent //666!//

I unpacked my stuff and laid down on the comfortable bed. I thought I should order some room service, so I enjoyed an absolutely amazing yet standard meal of bacon and eggs. What a wonderful meal.

Alas, after the meal, my stomach had started burning. Perhaps my stomach wasn&#39;t in the mood for the //&#34;Wakey Wakey, Eggs And Bac-y&#34;// special they had offered that today. It&#39;s alright, though. I was going to the beach soon, and I wouldn&#39;t get any burns there!

Before I left, number three went in.

I arrived at the beach with assistance from a Lyft driver who was quite the gentleman, if I did say so myself. I set up my beach chair and laid back, my sunglasses and hat on. A nice woman walked by and offered me a flower necklace. It would have been rude to refuse, so of course, I accepted! What a beautiful woman. She was nice, too. I hope she was as happy as I was.

I was laying down, and I realized that I was really thirsty. Like, really thirsty. I got up and walked to a convenience stand and ordered a water. I chugged it down, but I was still thirsty. And God, it got hot. My stomach was still burning and I started to sweat profusely. I got back in the car and drove to the hotel, going to my room //555.// It was so nice to be at home.

I laid down, turning down the thermostat to a solid sixty. It was still so hot. 

Oh, God, it burned. My sides. My stomach. They both burned. I needed to lay down.

And so I did. But, before I did, number four went in.

-----

And now I&#39;m here, stuck in //555&#39;s// bathroom, puking my brains out into the toilet bowl. It&#39;s too bright. And the light is off. What can I do? 

I can close my eyes. 

No, no. The darkness is scary. 

Pills! More pills, yes! I need more, seriously. The darkness is too much, and I can&#39;t handle going outside. 

I need more.

And five goes in.

...

What?

It all stopped?

The pills. They worked. But, now, I smell **//that ocean scent.//** God, it&#39;s strong. 

It&#39;s a bit too strong.

Fuck, that&#39;s bright. Did it get hot in here? 

Yeah, it did. I need to lay down.

Goodnight, **//Bahamas.//**

-----

The Foundation agents stood in room //555,// looking at the tablets on the nightstand. The lamp was on, and the package of capsules glowed profusely. 

&#34;Hot damn,&#34; Agent Salla said as he looked down at the capsules. He picked them up, turning them around to read the warning inscribed on the back.

&#34;Poor bastard. As least he was able to enjoy that sweet ocean scent before he went.&#34;</textarea></pre>
