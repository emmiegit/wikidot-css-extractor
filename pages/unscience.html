&#34;Explain to me the appeal of this, John.&#34; Dr. Reese leaned on the counter as she waited for the popcorn to finish. &#34;I mean, those shows are just so trashy... not a shred of scientific fact behind them.&#34; 

Johnathan West snickered. &#34;That&#39;s exactly what makes them so fun, Margaret.&#34; He looked in the fridge, taking out a bottle of Vanilla Coke, the king of soft drinks. &#34;It&#39;s so much damn fun to just sit down with a few guys from other departments, and //laugh// at History or Discovery or Science.&#34; Of course, he was talking about the various &#34;educational&#34; channels that were on cable TV. 

&#34;What about The Learning Channel? We&#39;re not going to watch... you know...&#34; 

Dr. West frowned, and shook his head at Dr. Reese. &#34;Margaret, please. The Foundation is cold, not cruel. I don&#39;t think we even let D-Class watch those.&#34; He snickered at the thought of it. &#34;Now come on. Tonight is a rerun of Ancient Aliens, and then that damn Mermaids...&#34; He made quotes with his fingers on each syllable, &#34;Documentary&#34;.  

The popcorn finished, and was soon on its way to the employee lounge in Basement Level 3.

------

Dr. Tristan Bailey was in a giggle fit over the images on the screen. &#34;Oh my //God.// West, pause it. For the love of God, pause it.&#34; And paused it was; on screen was an alien apparently within an ancient Egyptian bas-relief, the picture in black and white. Dr. Bailey pointed right at the alien. &#34;Someone look at me right in the eye, without... without laughing, and tell me that looks real.&#34; 

&#34;...so much artifacting,&#34; said Dr. Hendricks, adjusting his eyeglasses. &#34;My god. Aliens are //not// that blurry. Are they even trying?&#34;

&#34;This is made for the American Public, Dr. Swatter.&#34; Dr. West took a handful of popcorn and munched on it, Dr. Hendricks cringing at his nickname. &#34;Most of them have to look at the back of Encyclopedia Brown books to get the answer. Besides, they eat up anything paranormal.&#34;

Dr. Bailey snickered, unpausing the video. &#34;Kind of funny, though, isn&#39;t it? I mean, aliens //do// exist, along with half of the stuff that&#39;s featured on shows like this.&#34; He started counting off on his fingers. &#34;Bigfoot, tulpas, werewolves, ghosts...&#34;

Dr. West chimed in. &#34;Cities on Mars, demons, the occult, dragons...&#34; 

&#34;Goatmen, melonheads, The Loch Ness monster.&#34; Dr. Hendricks, who was part of the cryptozoology department, decided to start listing some as well. &#34;Living dinosaurs, mermaids, unicorns...&#34; 

&#34;Really? Unicorns? That&#39;s a new one on me, Hendricks.&#34; Hendricks stiffened, before remembering that Margaret was technically cleared to know about those and relaxing. Dr. Reese shook her head. &#34;You&#39;d think that they&#39;d find just //one// bit of convincing evidence instead of having to fake every damn thing.&#34; 

&#34;That&#39;s the appeal of the show, Dr. Reese.&#34; Tristan reclined on the couch, sipping a stolen bottle of Vanilla Coke, the prince of soft drinks, only second to Mountain Dew. &#34;The masses can believe, the rest of us can laugh.&#34;

------
&#34;I&#39;ve developed a theory,&#34; said Dr. West as he returned with another bowl of popcorn, &#34;Explaining why these shows are so popular.&#34; The Ancient Aliens episode turned out to be a two-parter, so they needed more snacks. He sat next to Dr. Reese and offered her the bowl.

&#34;Care to explain, Johnathan?&#34; Dr. Hendricks chewed on a bit of gum. Without realizing it, he was actually making some very loud popping noises; Tristan gave him a dirty look, and he stopped.

&#34;It&#39;s simple, Dr. Hendricks. The further the scientific credibility of something falls, the more popular it becomes. TLC became much more highly rated after it turned itself into the freakshow channel. Discovery became //far// more popular after Mythbusters came on the air-&#34;

&#34;What&#39;s your problem with Mythbusters, John?&#34; Dr. Reese glowered at him. &#34;My sister&#39;s kid watches it all the time; it at least tries to be educational.&#34;

West threw up his arms defensively. &#34;I&#39;m not saying it isn&#39;t educational, but it&#39;s //pop.// It doesn&#39;t teach any quantum physics; just basic science and chemistry, and maybe how to handle firearms.&#34; 

&#34;Normal people can&#39;t handle quantum physics.&#34; Tristan chuckled. &#34;Hell, //I// could barely handle it when I first started getting education so I could work in Multi-U.&#34; He shook his head. &#34;Trevor was always the one that was good at that, and he got diplomatic work. Go figure.&#34;

West sighed, stretching and totally not casually trying to put his arm around Dr. Reese&#39;s shoulder. &#34;I call it the Theory of UnScientific Credibility.&#34; He looked around his seat. &#34;Where the hell&#39;s my Coke?&#34; West gave Tristan a suspicious look, shaking his head. &#34;Whatever. What&#39;s this show on, anyway? Last one was about alien mummies.&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s about how aliens killed the fucking dinosaurs,&#34; sighed Hendricks. &#34;I&#39;m glad we don&#39;t have a paleontology department here. They&#39;d have killed this TV loooong ago.&#34;

------
They flipped to Animal Planet next. //Mermaids: The Body Found// was on; it was about midnight. &#34;Last one,&#34; Margaret said, looking at Dr. Hendricks. &#34;Jason, is it true what they say about this one?&#34; 

Jason Hendricks frowned at Dr. Reese, scratching his birthmark. &#34;What do they say about it? That it&#39;s complete and utter scientific garbage?&#34;

&#34;I think she&#39;s referring to the rumor that this is a Foundation cover op,&#34; said Dr. West, rubbing his stubble. &#34;Which it isn&#39;t... right, Dr. Swatter?&#34; Jason swatted his own forehead at the nickname and sighed, West giving an apologetic look. 

&#34;No, it is not. It is, however, a travesty against common sense, cryptozoology, and the documentary genre.&#34; He threw his hands up at one of the merpeople on the screen. &#34;I mean, for fuck&#39;s sake, an Atlantic //Homo aquaticus// isn&#39;t going to look the same as one from the Indian ocean. It&#39;s just so implausible!&#34;

&#34;...Is that really the only problem you have with it?&#34; Tristan groaned. &#34;I swear, if you&#39;re going to spend this entire mockumentary pointing out all the inconsistencies with //actual// merpeople, I&#39;m leaving.&#34; West threw an empty soda bottle at the back of Tristan&#39;s head.

&#34;Don&#39;t be an ass, Bailey. You&#39;d be doing the same if this was an episode of Through the Wormhole.&#34; Tristan muttered something about how that show was actually okay, and John looked at Dr. Hendricks. &#34;You were saying?&#34;

&#34;Well, for one thing, they&#39;re not evolved from apes; they&#39;re evolved from fish. They shouldn&#39;t look humanoid, they should look piscine. Their arms are too long, and they only have two of them, and there&#39;s absolutely no decoration for mating rituals.&#34; He looked at Dr. West. &#34;I actually have a thesis I wrote about freshwater //Homo aquaticus// that you can probably get from the archives, if you want.&#34;

&#34;I&#39;ll look it up some time, Jason.&#34; He leaned back on the couch. &#34;...Wait, aren&#39;t those baleen whales? Why the hell would they eat something humanoid?&#34;

&#34;Everybody?&#34; Tristan raised a finger into the air over his head. &#34;3... 2... 1...&#34; He brought it down.

&#34;It just raises too many questions,&#34; said the entire group simultaneously. They all broke into a snickering fit afterwards.

------
&#34;Welp,&#34; Dr. West stood from the couch and started stretching and turning off the TV. &#34;That was bullshit. All of it. 100% bullshit.&#34;

&#34;At least it makes you think,&#34; said Hendricks, rotating his shoulders and heading for the door of the lounge. &#34;It makes you think about a universe where the laws of evolution are sideways and backwards, and where aliens killed the dinosaurs.&#34; He looked at Tristan. &#34;I... is there a universe like that?&#34;

&#34;I&#39;ve counted at least ten,&#34; said Dr. Bailey, chewing on a stick of gum he had borrowed from Hendricks. &#34;In five of those, the Dinosaurs fought back during the Cretaceous; in two of them, they&#39;re the dominant species. The dinosaurs, not the aliens.&#34; 

&#34;Well,&#34; Dr. Reese yawned. &#34;That was fun, but it&#39;s bedtime for me. I have tests to run tomorrow on that thing we recovered from the crash site. Hendricks, your department is co-supervising that, yes?&#34;

&#34;Considering that the creatures on there may have been sapient, it&#39;s a bit of a gray area until proven otherwise. But we&#39;ll be checking in every now and then, yes.&#34; Dr. Hendricks rubbed his eyes, and started walking off. &#34;Well, g&#39;night everyone.&#34;

&#34;Night, Dr. Sw-Hendricks!&#34; Johnathan managed to catch himself before he said &#34;Swatter&#34;, and looked at Tristan, as the remaining three started walking down the hallway. &#34;Say, Bailey, maybe we could invite Ewell to the next one? Or Sinclair or someone else?&#34;

&#34;Now that you mention it, there is something on about Nazis and demonology next week on History...&#34;
