**Conspectus**
[[/=]]

Assassins. We are right to be terrified about them. Deathly efficient at what they do. Truly loyal to nothing but money. Follow tasks with little to no questions. Cannot be bargained with. Able to suppress their emotions and consciences, to the point where it seems like they lack them altogether. 

All of these traits coalesce together into the kinds of people who are spoken about with dread.

And none are as dreaded across the Veil&#39;s festering underbelly as S&#39;amh Armh was.

**Knowledge**
[[/=]]

**Traits:** A steel and irrilite //Sidhe// behemoth, S&#39;amh Armh was, allegedly, more machine than Fae by the time he met his grisly end on the Merchants&#39; [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lte-1998-burnout-blaecca-parallax|Soul Train.]]] His wings were clipped off and a jetpack was screwed in in their place. The majority of his brain was replaced with wetware components. An incinerator was built into his left hand for him to easily and messily eliminate his prey. The only truly organic body parts of him left were his eyes, and even those were heavily augmented.

He was also rumored to possess a rune-enhanced irrilite katana that constantly let off red-coloured electricity, able to cut through bullets and surfaces like they were made of melted butter.[[footnote]]Something about this seems familiar. //-- Hixel//[[/footnote]]

**Nature:** Prior to his joining [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/centre-de-primordial|Primordial]]], S&#39;amh Armh was supposedly a //Sidhe// of few words, preferring to let his fearsome reputation and ruthless actions do the talking. Seconds before going in for the kill, he would utter, &#34;You killed her. Now die for it.&#34;[[footnote]]Interesting. So he was using the death of Ne&#39;amh as a motivation for his hits? //-- F&#39;renzil//[[/footnote]]^^,@&lt; &gt;@^^[[footnote]]Or, more likely, as an excuse. //-- Hopper//[[/footnote]] to his target shortly before murdering them.

When he joined with the mercenary outfit, however, he grew cockier and more bombastic. Toying with his targets, taunting them, at one point even trying to turn one to Primordial&#39;s side. It&#39;s not fully known what caused this change in personality, but it is speculated to be related to his last freelance assassination. And, mayhaps, it was a partial cause for his downfall.

**History &amp; Associated Parties:** According to the legends, S&#39;amh Armh was abducted from the streets of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/esterberg-city-wikipedia|Esterberg]]], alongside numerous other Fae orphans [[footnote]]Sadly, a not uncommon occurence during the 70s. One of my sisters, for example, was taken from our orphanage by a man who drove a [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Volga|Black Volga]]]. //-- Oliwia Ma&#39;ron//[[/footnote]] -- including his future lover Ne&#39;amh Alana -- by operatives of Prometheus Laboratories sometime in the early 70s.[[footnote]]This is... unusually unethical, even by their standards. This is something I&#39;d expect more from the Jailors. //-- Lanius//[[/footnote]]^^,@&lt; &gt;@^^[[footnote]]It was the Cold War. All the paratech companies were doing unethical things, if it meant getting rich. //-- Hopper//[[/footnote]] Whatever horrific experiments the two young Fae endured has been lost to time,[[footnote]]Though it&#39;s been rumored that they were attempting to turn them into Fae [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/samsara|Samsara Units]]], to be placed on the front lines of wars in lieu of human operatives. //-- Hopper//[[/footnote]] on account of the facility they were held in being destroyed, with extreme predjudice, by S&#39;amh during their escape.

The two of them were split apart, with S&#39;amh believing Ne&#39;amh for dead as he made his way through the seedy underbelly of the Bookburner&#39;s Free Port Eurtec. He survived his time there by being a street urchin, a pack mule, a spy...

And, eventually, a freelance assassin.

His most frequent client, according to the urchins, was a woman named Ann Lukas, who provided him both payment and power for a virtual reality setup he used to relive his time with Ne&#39;amh.[[footnote]]I don&#39;t know whether to find that sweet, or pathetic. //-- Midnight//[[/footnote]] The hits started small, as they were wont to do. Peddlers of black market wares that pissed off vengeful customers. Freelancers that botched one too many jobs. Civilians that just looked at the elite and powerful funny.

Numerous times through his career, he was offered a spot in the Primordial mercenary group, its leaders recognizing S&#39;ahm&#39;s talents as he took on bigger and more ambitious assassinations, growing as a feared legend. However, the //Sidhe// would decline every single time.

That would all change when he killed a Merchant employee named [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/everchase|Nicole Aaron]]].[[footnote]]Who is practically a ghost outside of Marshall, Carter, &amp; Darke&#39;s records. //-- Hopper//[[/footnote]] For reasons not fully known to us, S&#39;amh Armh went radio silent for a month. Perhaps it was to lay low, after murdering one of the Merchants&#39; own. Or it could&#39;ve been the Bookburners cracking down on Eurtec&#39;s organized crime.

Whatever the case was, he would soon accept a spot in Primordial, and eventually landed a contract with the very Merchants he&#39;d gone up against.[[footnote]]Though I suppose the pay upgrade they offered him also played a part of it. //-- Hopper//[[/footnote]]

Ironically, it was on the Prometheus-built, and Merchant-owned, Soul Train that he would meet his end, thanks to the efforts of Bookburner Captain Camille Caldwell and a very unfortunate exposure to the Broken Day.[[footnote]]A wretched experience. I would not recommend seeking it out. //-- Hopper//[[/footnote]]

At least, that&#39;s the story we&#39;re told by the Bookburners...

**Approach:** If S&#39;amh Armh were to approach you, you likely would&#39;ve been dead before you even noticed.

To the best of my knowledge, however, the Fae never retaliated against those who wrote such mockeries.

//And desperate.//

//I had an EMP device, tucked within my pocket, just in case of an emergency like this. Through my lightheadedness, and the blistering fiery pain, I grabbed it, pressed the button, and threw it right at S&#39;amh Armh.//

//He cried out in pain, dropping me from his grasp as the incinerator died out in his palm. I didn&#39;t stick around to wait and see just how badly the EMP fucked up his systems. I grabbed my files, ran to the nearest alley, and opened a Way back to the Library as quickly as I could.//

//I count myself lucky every day that he didn&#39;t follow me, and that he&#39;s no longer a threat.//

//That&#39;s when I saw it from the window. The unmistakeable glint of a sniper&#39;s scope.//

//I barely had any time to react, before there were two cracks in the air, the piercing of glass. The Whitecoat slumped over his dish, a hole clean through his temple to the back of his head.//

//That&#39;s when the pain hit me. The other bullet had been aimed at me, likely to kill two birds with two stones. But bless it, the course of the wind must have changed at the last minute.//

//Because he managed to &#34;only&#34; take out my right eye.//

//UIU was on the scene like flies to honey. Turned out, S&#39;amh Armh had a very outstanding bounty, due to his assassination of a City Council member years before. The only reason they hadn&#39;t nailed the bastard before was because of the jurisdictional headache arresting him would cause...//

//Anyway, I&#39;d like to think not even he would be able to go up against the golems they have on their payroll. Because as soon as he saw the flashing lights, he cloaked himself and fucked off to god-knows-where.//

**Doubt**
[[/=]]

Of course, given the scarcity of some of the information we have on S&#39;amh Armh, some of our more skeptical members have raised questions about the official history we put together. Please do note that the following are just theories, and should be taken with a grain of salt.

* Nicole Aaron was, in reality, Ne&#39;amh Alana under an assumed identity. And upon finding this out after completion of the hit, S&#39;amh fell into a depressive state that softened him up into joining Primordial.[[footnote]]As unlikely as it sounds, it is possible. Ne&#39;amh Alana&#39;s body was never found, and as mentioned before, there&#39;s barely any records of Nicole Aaron&#39;s existence. Fae nomenclatural magic involved? -- //Hopper//[[/footnote]]
* S&#39;ahm did not actually die on the Soul Train, and the entire report of it from &#34;LTE-1998-Blaecca-Parallax&#34; was a fabrication the Bookburners made to save face after their disaster of an operation.[[footnote]]I highly doubt this one. The Bookburners are usually honest about their fuckups on the paperwork. -- //Hopper//[[/footnote]]
* S&#39;ahm never actually existed in the first place, and was a Eurtec urban legend perpetuated by the Bookburners in order to give themselves the justification for clamping down on the city&#39;s underbelly after the Cold War&#39;s end put Eurtec through a slump.[[footnote]]Now this one is just ridiculous. Why would they make themselves seem so incompetent, by creating a boogeyman with such a high kill rate? -- //Hopper//[[/footnote]]^^,@&lt; &gt;@^^[[footnote]]Fear and paranoia tend to make people overlook such things. -- //Midnight//[[/footnote]]

The truth is, we will likely never know S&#39;amh Armh&#39;s full story. After all, dead Fae tell no tales.[[footnote]]By the way, Hopper. I&#39;ve been speaking with L.S. on the side. They said there&#39;s no record of you within our files, nothing about a submission of information from Esterberg in 1996, and certainly no recollection about asking you to contribute to this file... I suggest you start being honest with us. -- //Scribe Tonsillar//[[/footnote]]^^,@&lt; &gt;@^^[[footnote]]Ah. Well you see, there&#39;s an interesting explanation for this, but[[/footnote]]^^,@&lt; &gt;@^^[[footnote]]Where the fuck did he go? I was watching him the whole time. There&#39;s no way he could create a Way without moving his hands. //-- Mrghn//[[/footnote]]^^,@&lt; &gt;@^^[[footnote]]Everyone, spread out and search for him. And I want an explanation of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/yggdrasils-surveyor|how they were able to so easily gain access to our files.]]] -- //L.S.//[[/footnote]]
