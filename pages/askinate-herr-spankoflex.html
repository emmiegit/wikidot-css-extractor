&gt; **Editor&#39;s Note:**
&gt; 
&gt; //Sorry about the spotty translation of SCP-2337&#39;s gibberish. I&#39;ve got at least three Euclids that are potentially going Keter by the end of the week, and I&#39;ve wasted enough time building a keyboard with a &#34;Cack!&#34; button to worry about finding someone to write an English-Spanko Dictionary.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Thankfully, the guys in the linguistics department hooked me up with some software that they wanted me to test. It&#39;s supposed to be able to analyze these sort of english-based pseudo-languages and provide clarification for some of the more incomprehensible bits. The results have been mixed, but it&#39;s better than nothing.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Anyway, just leave any questions you have in the section below, and I&#39;ll try to get an answer out of SCP-2337.//

&gt; **Dear Dr. Spanko,**
&gt; **I fear I find myself in a most unusual conundrum. I am, as you surely are, a man of science, yet I find myself surrounded by people who insist that I am, in fact, an aquatic mollusk. I know full well that I am no such thing, but they insist on treating me as if I were in spite of my protestations to the contrary. What means would you advise by which to resolve this state of affairs?**

//Note: Upon further questioning, it appears that [[[SCP-1867]]] and SCP-2337 had been traveling companions for a period of time ranging from 18██ to 18██. 1867 seems to be fully aware of 2337&#39;s anomalous properties, and describes 2337 as being &#34;a good sport, but a bit of an odd duck if you know what I mean&#34;, citing difficulties in understanding 2337 as the main reason they stopped traveling together. Due to the difficulty in translating SCP-2337&#39;s speech, the accounts of their travels have yet to be confirmed.//
