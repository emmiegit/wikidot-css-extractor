&#34;What is it?&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s a mechanical fan that has the ability to play the electric guitar, sir.&#34;

&#34;Ha ha, does it blow you away when it plays?&#34; 

&#34;Yes, sir.&#34;

&#34;Mentally or physically?&#34;

&#34;Both sir, its musical talent with an electric guitar is unparalleled. However, it also produces a wind velocity of 90kph when playing.&#34; 

&#34;I was joking, but that&#39;s actually pretty funny. Anything else I need to know?&#34;

&#34;The fan has fans, sir.&#34; 

&#34;People fans or mechanical fans?&#34;

&#34;Both, sir. It has a large following of people who appreciate its music, but it also has a collection of mechanical fans.&#34;

&#34;Okay, give them a Class-B amnestic and call it a day.&#34;

&#34;The people fans or the mechanical fans, sir?&#34;

&#34;Give the people fans the amnestic and contain the mechanical fans. You think you&#39;ll have trouble doing it?&#34;

&#34;It should be a breeze, sir.&#34; 

&#34;A breeze created by the fan that prevents you from carrying out the order?&#34;

&#34;No I meant it should be an easy job, sir.&#34;

&#34;Good, glad that&#39;s sorted out. Now to deal with the running refrigerator in Sector-118.&#34;

&#34;Sir, do you mean the refrigerator is physically sprinting or do you mean it is a workin-&#34;

&#34;--Don&#39;t even start.&#34;</textarea></pre>
