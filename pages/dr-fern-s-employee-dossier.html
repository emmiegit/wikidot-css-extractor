Employee ID: 0696805-DC-LV3

Name: Dr. Patrick Fernandez Lomas

Occupation: Research and Education 

Department: Tactical Theology

Status: Deceased. See below for incident details.

+++ Archived Former SCP Status Description

&gt; **Item #:** SCP-XXXX
&gt; 
&gt; **Object Class:** --Keter-- Safe
&gt; 
&gt; **Special Containment Procedures:** Containment of SCP-XXXX is currently unnecessary as SCP-XXXX&#39;s employment by the SCP Foundation ensures it&#39;s continual observation. SCP-XXXX primarily resides in its joint living dormitory and research laboratory in Site-17. SCP-XXXX is required to host weekly educational seminars to staff on level appropriate Containment Articles and time-relevant GOI documents and information. 
&gt; 
&gt; --**Archived Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell surrounded by a level 4 Faraday Cage. Only Level 3 and above personal are approved in testing with SCP-XXXX to determine how advanced its knowledge of the SCiPNet database is, as well as GOI databases with relevant personnel researching said GOI.-- 
&gt; 
&gt; **Edit 1:** SCP-XXXX must wear its regulated safety goggles at all times as a result of Incident XXXX-A
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** SCP-XXXX is Dr.[[footnote]] Formerly Pastor [[/footnote]] Patrick Fernandez Lomas[[footnote]] I prefer Fern, thanks again for letting me edit my own document [[/footnote]] a level three researcher employed in the Tactical Theology Department. SCP-XXXX has complete unrestricted access to the SCipNet database from within its own mind, as well as select portions of multiple GOI&#39;s internal databases. The limit of knowledge obtainable by SCP-XXXX has, as of latest testing, shown no limit. Articles containing congitohazardous material, memetics, antiemetics, or articles normally restricted behind level 5 access are available to SCP-XXXX without the expected physical and mental consequences that are typical to exposure to such information. 
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-XXXX possesses a secondary anomalous ability to interface with printers capable of wireless printing and producing documents that has been accessed from it&#39;s mind hereby referred to as SCP-XXXX-A. SCP-XXXX-A resemble mundane webpage printouts[[footnote]] Interestingly enough these webpage printouts do not resemble official SCiPNet documentation, though any GOI document produced by SCP-XXXX will be an exact match to GOI documents in possession by the Foundation [[/footnote]]. Any memetic hazard that would normally be present in any article produced by SCP-XXXX have been neutralized and as such every SCP-XXXX-A are safe to read. Redactions present in official SCP articles will also be present in their corresponding SCP-XXXX-A.

++ Error. SWAN Entity Interference Detected.

Hey, Fern here. I have more than one article up on this wiki so I decided to create an author page! I recycled my first, obviously VERY very bad SCP about my AA that failed for obvious reasons into a employee dossier. This page will be updated next time I upload something else!
