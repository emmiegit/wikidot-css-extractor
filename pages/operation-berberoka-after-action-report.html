**Operation:** Berberoka

**Log Number:** 09052020/5142

**Risk Classification:** Kamatayan

**Foreword:** Berberoka is the designated codename for the operation initiated against the Valravn Corporation after it illegally operated within the Philippine territory and committed several acts of human rights violations. Valravn operated under the employment of Zenith, a multi-national industrial conglomerate, after the latter purchased land in Mindanao for mineral cultivation projects. This violated several provisions of the 1987 Philippine Constitution due to the fact that Zenith Group is owned by foreigners, as well as their deliberate exploitation of the archipelago&#39;s natural resources without proper permission from Local Government Units and the Republic of the Philippines, and thus viewed as an attack to the national interest of the country that necessitated AFP intervention.

The operation took place in Tawi-Tawi, Mindanao where Zenith Group purchased land from one Mr. Abdul Karim for an undisclosed sum of money. The land in question was located in the municipality of Masantong, near a populated settlement. For some reason, Zenith Group hired foreign and local Private Armed Groups, specifically the al-Asrif Group [[footnote]] Former anti-communist vigilante group turned guns-for-hire. [[/footnote]], and deployed them to the settlement in an attempt to displace the residents. The residents fought back and managed to repel the attackers before the PAGs struck for the second time.

The residents were successfully displaced and scattered across Masantong by the PAGs. In desperation, they enlisted the help of an anomalous armed communist group related to The Serpent&#39;s Hand, //Ang Sinumpa//[[footnote]] The Cursed [[/footnote]], and launched an all out attack against the contested settlement where the combined forces of the residents and the //Sinumpa// operatives managed to retake the area. Due to the confirmed presence of the anomalous armed group, Zenith Group then hired the Valravn Corporation, an Anomalous Private Military Company, to counter the attack of the residents and the //Sinumpa// operatives.

The resulting catastrophe led to the deaths of the residents and //Sinumpa// operatives. The surviving //Sinumpa// elements retreated to several of their hideouts across Tawi-Tawi but were pursued by Valravn assets, presumably to neutralize them.

The Anomalous Warfare Battalion was scrambled for deployment after the skirmishes between the two anomalous groups threatened to pierce the Veil of normalcy and to halt the increasing amount of civilian casualties.

**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** 

The 817VLTR-1D &#34;Vulture&#34; model is a surveillance drone upgraded from the S17-8F Foundation Drone model that the SCP Foundation donated to us. It was previously a battery-operated drone modified to be gas-fuelled that operates on 500 liters worth of diesel. Its capability was further expanded with the addition of combat features, as well as storage and logistic functions which enabled the drone to provide support fire missions and deliver emergency supplies to troops on the battlefield. It has a memory storage of up to 20GB and can record videos with 720p resolution that the on-board computer automatically transmits directly to Main Command.

In addition, the drones in our inventory were blessed by Sanctioned Katalonan Priestesses who disguised them as birds when viewed by unaided eyes.

There were at least fifty of these drones deployed in Philippine airspace, twenty of which were permanently stationed above Mindanao. As the engagements between the two groups raged across Tawi-Tawi, the drones were used to gauge the battlefield capabilities of the Valravn Corporation.

Marine Companies Alpha, Tango and Victor were prepared for the commencement of the operation.

**Log:** 

The following log was from a transcribed video of the initial engagement between the Valravn Corporation and //Sinumpa// operatives captured by Drone 7A-8:

&gt; **Date:** 25 AUG 2020
&gt; **Remarks:** N/A
&gt; **Belligerents:** Valravn Corporation and 3rd Armed Cell of the //Sinumpa//
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; 00.00.00 - Aerial shot of Baranggay Kamagong, an urbanized rural village consisting of a large public market, a mosque, concrete office buildings, and a few elementary and high schools. Clustered wooden huts can be seen sporadically across the Baranggay, connected to the area&#39;s plaza via beaten and muddy roads. The Baranggay was surrounded by thick trees. The skies were visibly cloudy due to the recent passing of a typhoon.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.00.20 - //Sinumpa// operatives entered the Baranggay and prompted unarmed civilians in their immediate vicinity to scatter and flee. The //Sinumpa// operatives hastily proceeded deeper into the Baranggay where they were halted by armed police officers, whom they fired upon.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.00.45 - Behind them, armed men in unidentified tactical battle armors[[footnote]] Confirmed to be Valravn troops. [[/footnote]] entered the frame. Upon closer inspection, the surfaces of their protective equipment were carved with Nordic runes, presumably thaumaturgic protection of some kind. The two sides engaged in a firefight for a few seconds.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.01.25 - The firefight ended as //Sinumpa// operatives disengaged from the skirmish and retreated to the plaza, where they met up with more //Sinumpa// operatives. One of them initiated a thaumaturgic ritual that resulted in the soil beneath the Valravn ground forces erupting with large wooden stakes that impaled several of them.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.01.45 - Valravn forces suffered a number of casualties, resulting with their request for reinforcements in the form of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-chiron-model|Chiron Models]]] and [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/aar-1320-chacaltaya|Valkyrie Units]]].
&gt; 
&gt; 00.02.00 - Some of the //Sinumpa// operatives waved esoteric items [[footnote]] Some of these items were a handkerchief with occult symbols, a pendant that contained an embryo of a duck and a cane fashioned after a human body. [[/footnote]] in the air, resulting with the appearances of several humanoid elemental entities. The entities aided their masters in the firefight. They launched streaks of flames, geysers of water and tiny pebbles from their hands at the Valravn ground forces.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.20.45 - Chiron Models armed with occult weaponry neutralized the elementals, which also killed several //Sinumpa// operatives in the process due to the destructive nature of the weapons. Remaining //Sinumpa// operatives were forced to flee the area.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.02.30 - //Sinumpa// operatives were outflanked by the Chiron Models, forcing them to find another path but Valkyrie Units reached them and neutralized the //Sinumpa// operatives.
&gt; 
&gt; [END LOG]

Several engagements such as these were captured in video by the drones with no apparent change on Valravn&#39;s assets deployment. Preparations and planning were soon undertaken to neutralize Valravn Corporation&#39;s presence in the national territory.

**Surveillance 5142/25**

The following is a transcripted log of a video detailing the raid conducted by Victor Company on the Tarawakan Hideout of the //Sinumpa// and the capture of Arturo Bagatsing, a high priority target and the leader of the 3rd Armed Cell of the group. In addition, several esoteric items were also confiscated inside the hideout.

&gt; **Date:** 27 AUG 2020
&gt; **Remarks:** N/A
&gt; **Belligerents:** Victor Company of the AWBn and 3rd Armed Cell of the //Sinumpa//
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; 00.00.00 - The hideout was an abandoned hardware store with two floors and a large backyard behind it. Sacks of cement powder and hollow blocks were stacked on top of each other on the left side, half covered by a blue tarp. At the farther back of the backyard, three small warehouses were seen, lit by dots of orange lights, presumably gaslight candles and burning cigarette sticks. Thermal enhancement imaging of the video revealed at least fifty operatives inside the walled-in compound.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.00.13 - Squad Echo-1 of Victor Company proceeded towards the main entrance of the hardware store, accompanied by Squads Echo-2 and Echo-3. Squad Echo-4 remained on standby outside, on watch against potential interlopers and to act as the cut-off squad.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.00.45 - Squad Echo-1 breached the entrance of the building and infiltrated the structure alongside Echo-2 and Echo-3. Thermal enhancement imaging revealed a brief firefight within the structure, resulting with the neutralization of the //Sinumpa// sentries posted in the building. The Marines also suffered a minor casualty, who was immediately evacuated.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.01.02 - Squads Echo-5 and Echo-6 proceeded to move towards the back entrance of the compound that will lead directly to the warehouses. At this point, //Sinumpa// elements within the warehouses were alerted to the firefight inside the building and began to establish a defensive perimeter around the three smaller buildings.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.01.35 - A firefight broke out between the Marines inside the hardware store and the //Sinumpa// operatives near the warehouses, the attention on the back entrance averted. Squads Echo-5 and Echo-6 successfully infiltrated the back entrance amidst the commotion and proceeded towards the middle warehouse through its backdoor.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.02.02 - The firefight was in favor of the Marines as the //Sinumpa// suffered several casualties. Squads Echo-5 and Echo-6 exfiltrated from the middle warehouse with a restrained man whose head was covered with a sack.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.02.40 - Squads Echo-5 and Echo-6, along with the man, boarded inside an unmarked military truck. Squads Echo-7, Echo-8 and Echo-9 infiltrated the back entrance of the compound and completely surrounded the //Sinumpa// operatives.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.03.00 - The firefight ended with only fourteen //Sinumpa// operatives surviving. However, they are subsequently terminated after their surrender.

&gt; 
&gt; **1st Lt. &#34;Veritas&#34;:** Raven?
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** Don&#39;t play dumb, the Valravn! You&#39;re using them to kill all of us!
&gt; 
&gt; **L:** I&#39;m not here for your stupid games, Bagatsing. Tell me anything about this &#34;Valravn&#34; that we don&#39;t know yet.
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** Why don&#39;t you tell me? Aren&#39;t you the ones rubbing elbows with them?
&gt; 
&gt; //1st Lt. &#34;Veritas&#34; glanced at an unseen Marine, who approached the camera and covered its lens for a brief moment. Sounds of muffled whimpering and groaning were heard before the cover was removed, revealing the subject with a bleeding forehead and a swelling left eye.//
&gt; 
&gt; **L:** I&#39;m not in the mood for your bullshit. Keep playing with me and I&#39;ll leak the hideouts of the //Sinumpa// to the Valravn to save us some paperwork and bodybags.
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** Agh! Was that even necessary? I was gonna tell you everything, alright?! //[Sighs]// What do you want to know?
&gt; 
&gt; **L:** Anything useful. So far, we know that the Valravn is an Anomalous Private Military Corporation, but what kind of anomalous weaponry they are employing still remains a mystery. The information from our surveillance footages needed confirmation from firsthand witnesses.
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** So you had the skirmishes watched but you didn&#39;t do shit to protect the dead civilians?
&gt; 
&gt; **L:** There will be more if you don&#39;t spill the goddamn information I need, that is, if you truly care for them. But hey, you communists are fucking bastards who&#39;re willing to commit mass murders of innocents and genocide of minorities.
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** Fuck you, Marine.
&gt; 
&gt; //1st Lt. &#34;Veritas&#34; glanced at the unseen Marine again and nodded.//
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** Wait, wait, wait! I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry, okay?! I&#39;ll tell you now what I know. Their main forces are comprised of three types of soldiers so far. The first ones are the ground troopers, some of which are special forces that acted as shock troops. You&#39;d know them by the red vertical stripes across their helmets. The second were those that looked like centaurs.
&gt; 
&gt; **L:** Do you happen to know what they&#39;re called?
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** Well, we managed to capture one of the ground forces soldiers and tortured that information out of him. They call them Chiron.
&gt; 
&gt; **L:** Do you still have the prisoner?
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** Unfortunately, no. The cadre who captured them got slaughtered by the Valkyries, and as for the guy himself, well he was silenced by those //ninja aswang women//.
&gt; 
&gt; **L:** The-what? You know what, nevermind. The Chiron, are they impervious to regular bullets?
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** Yes, their armors are too strong for normal ammunition. We used specialized bullets against them but our stockpiles were destroyed by the Valravn bastards when they raided our armory hideout.
&gt; 
&gt; **L:** We have that covered. What about the Valkyries?
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** Those motherfuckers are the worse kind that the Valravn threw at us so far. They&#39;re almost impossible to see when they move, and their hands were attached with retractable swords-
&gt; 
&gt; **L:** How&#39;d you manage to kill them?
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** With fire, literally.
&gt; 
&gt; **L:** Anything else you want to add?
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** No, I don&#39;t. //[Looks away]//
&gt; 
&gt; **L:** If I find out you&#39;re lying, your friends are going to die and I will throw you in the deepest hole I could find where you will be spending the rest of your life thinking about what you just did to them.

Due to the extracted information, the participating AWBn Marine Companies were armed with occult ammunition in anticipation of the Chiron and Valkyrie assets of the Valravn APMC. The following ammunition are as follows: 

[[tabview]]
[[tab AMP Rounds]]
**5.56mm and 9mm Parabellum Anomalous Material Piercer (AMP) Rounds**

**Description:** Anomalous Material Piercer Rounds (AMP) are designed with three-pronged tips, sanctified with rituals from the major Abrahamic religions and carved with arcane Filipino thaumaturgic runes associated with destruction [[footnote]] The symbols of the Filipino God of War, Apollaki, and the God of Death, Sitan.[[/footnote]]. It is sometimes used in tandem with theological weapons against creatures with powerful hide or shell. As the name suggests, AMP rounds are used for annihilating anomalous materials that are otherwise indestructible.

[[/tab]]
[[tab PES Rounds]]
 **5.56mm Para-Energy Seeker (PES) Rounds**

**Description:** Paranormal Energy Seeker (PES) Rounds are red-tipped bullets, painted to be distinguished from regular 5.56mm ammunition. PES Rounds are enchanted by Sanctioned Mambabarangs [[footnote]] Esoteric Organic Assets of the Paranormal Combat Department, Armed Forces of the Philippines. A Mambabarang is a type of witch-doctor that casts spells on a target from afar through various means. [[/footnote]] that gave the rounds capability to home in on an object influenced by anomalous properties. As such, it is also a preferable choice when taking down anomalous entities with enhanced speed. Its only limitation is that it does not work on entities with memetic camouflages[[footnote]] Due to the nature of memetic camouflages to hide its user and its tendency to confuse the rounds because of this.

**Surveillance 5142/28**

Valravn activities were triangulated to an isolated island in Montay-Montay, where a large encampment was discovered. The main structure, a circular building with a domed roof, was heavily guarded by Valravn ground forces and Chiron assets. It was surrounded by smaller circular structures occupied by non-combatant Valravn personnel.

&gt; **Date:** 29 AUG 2020
&gt; **Remarks:** Seventh contact with Valravn forces.
&gt; **Belligerents:** Companies Alpha, Tango and Victor of the AWBn and Valravn Corporation
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; 00.00.00 - The area of operation is located at the base of a mountain, within a jungle behind a shore. Small groups of Valravn ground forces were seen patrolling the perimeter of the base while a larger group could be seen in front of the main structure in a formation, drilled by what appeared to be an officer. A few Valravn logistic personnel were seen, unloading cardboard boxes from a company-owned truck. Chiron Models armed with designated marksman rifles were seen on the battlements of the roof of the main structure.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.00.10 - Marines of the Alpha, Tango and Victor Companies initiated a landing at the shore, aboard a cloaked amphibious assault carrier, which flickered into view the moment its front ramp descended.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.00.15 - Mortar Teams attached to the Marine Companies set up their weapons and started launching payloads upon the base. The initial attack sent Valravn soldiers and logistic personnel in the air. The bulk of the companies proceeded to charge the disoriented Valravn troops with affixed bayonets while the drone&#39;s chin gun opened fire, the muzzle flare obscured the video feed briefly.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.00.21 - The Chiron Models armed with DMR on the roof were neutralized by the drone. The camera pans at the battlefield and revealed the Marines executing the last of the Valravn soldiers. Alpha Company approached the main structure while Tango Company proceeded to the smaller structures to clear it. Victor Company formed a perimeter to act as a cut off group.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.01.02 - Alpha Company proceeded to breach the main structure. Thermal enhancement imaging revealed that Valkyrie Units were gathered at the entrance of the facility. The Marines switched ammunition to PES rounds and terminated the sentries. They proceeded deeper and entered what appeared to be an office complex. Valravn officers and non-combatant personnel surrendered after the area was invaded by the Marines. They were ordered to huddle in a group before the Marines opened fire.

&gt; 00.00.00 - The area of operation is a residential subdivision of recently constructed concrete houses, populated by a large number of civilians. Construction equipment were scattered across the area. Nearby, a large river connected to the Celebes Sea could be seen.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.00.01 - Chiron Models appeared in the frame, firing upon the civilians which prompted them to scatter across the subdivision. Valkyrie Units, supported by Valravn ground forces, attacked the occupied houses indiscriminately. The action earned a response from law enforcement units nearby.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.00.45 - Responding PNP officers were neutralized within the first few seconds of the firefight. A detachment of PNP Special Action Force Troopers were then dispatched to the location of the commotion.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.01.24 - SAF Troopers managed to eliminate a small number of Valravn ground forces. However, they were soon neutralized to the last man by a squad of Valravn shock troops.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.01.30 - Alpha, Tango and Victor Companies of the Anomalous Warfare Battalion arrived in the conflicted area. The Marines eliminated the Chiron Models located in the subdivision central with AMP rounds and freed the large group of frightened civilians the Chiron Models detained in the location.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.02.00 - The surviving Chiron Models retreated but are pursued by the Marines. Upon encountering both the Valkyrie and regular ground forces, some of the Marines switched to PES rounds and eliminated a number of Valkyrie and ground forces units.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.02.30 - The Marines near the river suddenly dropped their weapons and clutched their ears. The camera could not identify what caused the disorientation when the Marines were suddenly pulled to the river simultaneously by an unseen force.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.03.12 - The surviving Marines initiated a tactical retreat to their entry point. Thermal enhancement imaging revealed several humanoid entities with cold temperatures. The drone&#39;s chin gun opened fire, obscuring the camera feed with a strobing flash. It managed to eliminate some of the humanoids but the entities suddenly disappeared from the imaging. View returned back to normal color.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.03.30 - Visual feed was replaced by static before it was lost. The sound of explosion was heard before white noise replaced the audio.

&gt; **L:** You know what you did, you fucker. You&#39;ve caused me the lives of my men, my men! They have families, memories and aspirations! Their blood is in your hands, you piece of shit!
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** Well, they certainly deserve it. I&#39;d definitely pay to see all of you die a brutal death. //[Laughs]// Karma&#39;s a bitch, ain&#39;t it?
&gt; 
&gt; **L:** Here&#39;s what is going to happen. We will send the location of your friends&#39; hideouts to the Valravn, or better yet, the anomalous Jihadist groups whom you have conflicts with. We will break your fucking limbs, cut out your tongue and remove your fucking eyelids. We will make you watch as they torture your friends with the most painful and degrading method we can suggest and we will even provide them with the tools to do it. You will do nothing because you can do nothing. You will watch them all die the most horrible way possible.
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** Listen, I&#39;m sorry, okay. I&#39;ll tell you what you want to know.
&gt; 
&gt; **L:** No, you have your chance. //[Looks at the unseen Marine]// Sergeant, make arrangements with the Alakdan Faction[[footnote]] An anomalous jihadist group under the Abu Sayyaf Group-Tawi-Tawi. [[/footnote]] first. Tell them we have interrogated a defecting //Sinumpa// officer, who spilled the group&#39;s state secrets.
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** No! Goddammit, no, please don&#39;t do that, I beg you!
&gt; 
&gt; **L:** Why&#39;d you do it, Arturo? Why didn&#39;t you tell us about this?
&gt; 
&gt; //1st Lt. &#34;Veritas&#34; placed a smartphone in front of the subject and played Civilian Camera Footage-5142.//
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** I was being stupid, I admit. I was hoping that Valravn will be able to destroy you since they are obviously powerful than you are.
&gt; 
&gt; //1st Lt. &#34;Veritas&#34; swiftly punched the subject twice. 1st Lt. &#34;Veritas&#34; retreated to his seat while Sgt. &#34;Phobos&#34; lifted the subject upright.//
&gt; 
&gt; **L:** You better tell me now how do we kill those damn things!
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** You may not believe me but the truth is, we don&#39;t know. The other cadres by the rivers encountered those...whatever the fuck those are. They are the //diablo//&#39;s children, that I can assure you. We couldn&#39;t kill them with normal bullets or even our esoteric weaponry so we resorted to creating //Silakbin//s instead.
&gt; 
&gt; **L:** What the hell are they supposed to be?
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** Well, //Silakbin//s are hounds similar to a //Sigbin//[[footnote]] The Sigbin is a folkloric cryptid inhabiting the Visayan islands. They are tailless furless hounds with long slender limbs, lowered heads, long flappy ears and moves backwards. Their diet consisted of human and cattle flesh, and their arrival are heralded by the clapping of their ears. [[/footnote]]. I am sure you&#39;re aware of-
&gt; 
&gt; **L:** I am aware of what a //Sigbin// is.
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** Well, they are almost the same, but dumber. Those hounds are blind but they can smell targets through thaumaturgic protection such as memetic camouflages. They are also unstoppable and resilient, their jaws were known to kill almost anything and they are loyal to whoever built them.
&gt; 
&gt; **L:** Memetic camouflages?
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** Well, yeah. We first employed them against the Swords of Mikhail[[footnote]] An armed fascist group operating in Northern Visayas and Southern Luzon. [[/footnote]] when the fascists deployed cognitohazardous images against us which killed many of my comrades. We even have to put blindfolds on in every firefight just to survive which is fucking stupid. In desperation, we turned to the Old Books and we found the solution. The //Silakbin//s&#39; lack of eyes made it a good candidate to counter their visual hazard weapons and its sharp olfactory sense is second to none.
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject smiled widely.//
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** I almost felt sorry for this one fascist who emptied his clip at a //Silakbin// and hit nothing but empty air. The //Silakbin// and their pack turned its attention at the fascist and tore him limb by limb.
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject looked directly at 1st Lt. &#34;Veritas&#34;//
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** We figured that those &#34;water spirits&#34; employed a memetic camouflage since the survivors of the attack did not see them at first, but some claimed that they saw some crying ladies[[footnote]] In all recorded instances involving the La Llorona Units, this was not found. It was theorized that the effects of the memetic camouflage of the Valravn assets only works with human eyes but rendered them invisible from electronic instruments, such as a camera. [[/footnote]] by the rivers or lakes before they struck. And we thought that maybe, the //Silakbin//s would work.
&gt; 
&gt; **L:** We don&#39;t really have much options here but to try that //Silakbin// you&#39;re talking about on the Lloronas. //[Pauses]// You will help us create them. If you tried another trick, you will see that my threats aren&#39;t empty.
&gt; 
&gt; **A:** Alright.

[[collapsible show=&#34;SURVEILLANCE 5142/40&#34; hide=&#34;-CLOSE&#34;]]

**Surveillance 5142/40**

The //Sinumpa// hideout in Lamion was leaked to the Valravn Corporation after the //Sinumpa// elements were tipped by Battalion OMNINT [[footnote]] Omniscient Intelligence Division [[/footnote]] operatives of an imminent attack by the Valravn Corporation under the guise of a &#34;concerned anonymous tip&#34;. The //Sinumpa// operatives evacuated the hideout an hour before the arrival of Valravn marine landing forces deployed from a corporate sea vessel 500 kilometers away from the island. The Marine Companies of the Battalion have already occupied the hideout before the Valravn reached the shore and were completing Ritual 9R-7, which was the aforementioned thaumaturgic ritual in Interrogation Log 5142-2 to create //Silakbin//s.

&gt; **Date:** 05 SEPT 2020
&gt; **Remarks:** N/A
&gt; **Belligerents:** Companies Alpha, Tango and Victor of the AWBn and Valravn Corporation
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; 00.00.00 - The area of operation was quiet. Treehouses above narra and mango trees covered with leaves, fronds and grasses could be seen. Thermal enhancement imaging revealed several Marines hiding inside in anticipation of the approaching Valravn forces. A valley that overlooked the lower ground could be seen in the east, fortified by a squad of Marines. Behind the trees was a cave, which was also occupied by the Marines. They are finalizing their creation of the anomalous lifeforms.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.00.12 - Chiron Models led the attacking party as scouts. The Marines inside the treehouses did not open fire. The Chiron Models then returned to the main Valravn forces before they proceeded deeper into the island.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.01.30 - A firefight broke out. The Marines inside the treehouses opened fire at the advancing ground forces. They eliminated the Chiron Models in the mix with AMP rounds, and Valkyrie Units with PES rounds.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.01.42 - The Valravn ground forces retaliated by firing their portable rocket launchers at the treehouses, burning at least six of the structures. Marines positioned in the eastern valley that overlooked the area below began firing at the ground forces to buy time for their fellow Marines to escape the burning treehouses.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.02.00 - The Marines in the eastern valley were outflanked by Valkyrie Units, who proceeded to eliminate them in CQC. The last Marine detonated his grenades in his belt moments before death, resulting in an explosion that neutralized the Valkyrie Units in the vicinity.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.02.45 - The Marines from the treehouses retreated into the cave. Valravn forces breached the last defenses. They proceeded towards the cave.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.03.00 - Thermal enhancement imaging activated and revealed the Marines gathering at the mouth of the cave. From the distance by the shore, several humanoid entities with non-existent heat signatures were seen, appearing and disappearing from the camera feed. They are approaching the cave.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.03.45 - The Marines stood their ground briefly before retreating deeper inside the cave. Valravn forces pursued, but were shortly neutralized after the appearance of several quadruped entities with slender limbs, long ears and forked tongue. The entities emitted no heat signature. They are notably fast that they are almost imperceptible in the camera feed.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.04.00 - A growing number of Valravn assets were neutralized in the process. Some of the ground forces unit attempted to fire their portable rocket launchers, only to miss. Their bodies and protective suits were gruesomely torn apart by the //Silakbin//s.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.04.23 - The humanoid entities owned by Valravn, designated in this document for brevity as &#34;La Llorona&#34; [[footnote]] Based on the recovered Civilian Camera Footage. [[/footnote]], engaged the //Silakbin// packs, resulting in the instant neutralization of some of the Valravn assets.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.04.25 - The remaining La Llorona Units engaged the //Silakbin// packs in CQC. One of them in particular managed to establish physical contact with a //Silakbin// and attempted to pull it towards the shore.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.04.29 - The //Silakbin// screeched[[footnote]] Audio muted due to the sound&#39;s cognitohazardous nature. [[/footnote]]; the La Llorona Unit was visibly disoriented as it let go of the //Silakbin//. Several //Silakbin//s disengaged from the other La Llorona Units, only to redirect their attack on the disoriented La Llorona Unit.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.04.35 - Valravn ground forces managed to retreat in a safe distance. They provided cover fire for the La Llorona Units, which earned the attention of the nearby //Silakbin//s, some of which departed from the main group currently in melee against the La Llorona Units to attack the ground forces.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.04.40 - Some of the Chiron Models and Valkyrie Units were sacrificed to allow the ground forces and the rest to reach the shore for safety. The //Silakbin// packs did not pursue and instead, redirected their attention at the remaining La Llorona Units.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.04.57 - Some of the individual La Llorona Units managed to tear apart //Silakbin//s with their cybernetic weapons, only to be taken down by others from its pack in retaliation. The surviving La Llorona Units attempted to disorient the //Silakbin//s by emitting a collective cry, only to solicit a combined screech from the //Silakbin//s that drowned the noises of the La Lloronas&#39; cries, resulting in the incapacitation of the Valravn assets.
&gt; 
&gt; 00.05.00 - Tactical retreat of Valravn forces was completed, with La Llorona assets abandoned and destroyed by the //Silakbin//s.
&gt; 
&gt; [END LOG]

Participating Marines were screened psychologically following the engagement. A number of thirty-seven (37) Marines became deaf while a number of twenty-five (25) Marines suffered stress disorders due to their exposure to the auditory cognitohazards produced by the La Llorona Units and the //Silakbin//s. They were treated with Class-B Amnestics and were given psychological and hearing rehabilitation therapies to cure their deafness and stress disorders. Marines failed to be cured by the treatments were moved to desk jobs for the sake of their well being.

After the 05 SEPT 2020 Engagement, the Anomalous Warfare Battalion&#39;s External and Foreign Relations Department received an invitation from the SCP Foundation&#39;s External Affairs Department for an open conference with a Valravn Public Relations representative.

&gt; 
&gt; //The camera activates and revealed three persons sitting around a circular wooden table. Behind each persons were two security detail from their respective organizations, visibly armed and silent.//
&gt; 
&gt; //The Valravn PR Representative adjusted his suit and tie before clearing his throat. He stood up and offered his hand to Dr. Reese Silva of the Foundation, who shook it, before finally offering his hand to Col. &#34;Omega&#34;.//
&gt; 
&gt; //The Marine Officer was reluctant at first but decided to accept the hand and shake it. The Valravn PR Representative then sat down.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Valravn Representative:** Good day, Colonel. We are happy to finally meet you. I am Doe, just Doe, and I will be representing the Valravn Corporation on their behalf.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Reese:** We are glad that you have accepted the parlay. I will be mediating-
&gt; 
&gt; **Col. &#34;Omega&#34;:** Let&#39;s get this shit over with. What do you want, Valravn?
&gt; 
&gt; **Doe:** We wanted to tell you that the Valravn Corporation has suffered tremendous losses of personnel and equipment over the past few days. We are hoping for a cease fire agreement in order for us to completely pull out of your nation&#39;s territory.
&gt; 
&gt; **Col. &#34;Omega&#34;:** The nerve of you demanding us of anything after you killed our people. And if we don&#39;t stop killing your employees, what will you do then?
&gt; 
&gt; **Doe:** Our company is a legitimate business entity, and as such, we are protected under the second provision of the &#34;Pristina Protocol&#34; that forbids any entities to attack us if we have decided to wave the white flag. That means you, Colonel, and your beloved Battalion. //[Grins]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Col. &#34;Omega&#34;:** You do realize that you&#39;re still mercenaries and that you are not covered under Geneva Convention, right? And don&#39;t mention the Protocol to me, we&#39;re not the Diablo&#39;s Battalion[[footnote]] 666IB or the 666th Infantry Battalion, &#34;El Batallón de la Diablo&#34;, is the Philippine Army&#39;s very own Paranormal Combat-capable Unit. [[/footnote]]. You stepped into Philippine soil looking for trouble. You sow death in our lands, that is what you will reap.
&gt; 
&gt; **Doe:** The High Table deeply regrets this unfortunate turn of events and hope we can achieve a productive relationship. //[Smiles]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Col. &#34;Omega&#34;:** Fuck your High Table, Valravn. You have lost here today and you will suffer the same fate in the future. We are aware that your company is continuously expanding their armaments to increase their functions, but news flash, so are we.
&gt; 
&gt; //The Marine Officer stood from his seat.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Doe:** Well, in that case, I&#39;ll take that as a &#39;no&#39;. We will still pull out of the islands either with your cease fire, //[Looks at the direction of Dr. Reese]// or through the assistance from one of our benefactors. We are hoping that this... &#34;sour&#34; relationship between our organizations would bloom into something... lucrative.
&gt; 
&gt; **Col. &#34;Omega&#34;:** What the hell does that mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **Doe:** There are forces in this region that are beyond your understanding, power and control. We, at Valravn Corporation, offer our services to those who can afford it regardless of our past with them, and believe me, Colonel, one day you will avail our services.
&gt; 
&gt; //Doe stands up to leave//
&gt; 
&gt; **Col. &#34;Omega&#34;:** Fucking salesman, right out of the script.

**Items Recovered:**

The following are recovered from the //Sinumpa// hideout in Tarawakan, Tawi-Tawi:

* A leather-bound ritual book
* A set of tools typically used in surgery
* 450kg of dog remains stored in a black plastic bag
* Candles
* Bundles of sampaguita flowers

Due to the effectiveness of the thaumaturgic ritual, the aforementioned objects were stored for safekeeping, its existence denied from groups of interest and irrelevant personnel. The entities created through it were stored in the Applied Thaumaturgy Combat Division&#39;s cryptid holding cells in an undisclosed location.

Arturo Bagatsing was forcibly amnesticized. He was then reunited with his family, who assumed him dead after he disappeared for twenty three years. Foundation agents within the Department of Social Welfare and Development disseminated false news to the family, who reluctantly accepted Bagatsing back. Undercover AWBn Marines from OMNINTEL Division and Agents from NBI-SOU were deployed in the neighborhood where the Bagatsing Household was located to protect Arturo from any //Sinumpa// elements that might retaliate for his &#34;sudden return to the fold of the government&#34;.

Currently, he is working as a tricycle driver in Davao City and is annually receiving monthly pensions from the government. He lives in peace.
