**SCP Files Documented:**

&#34;As scientists, there is a boundary which we must always know and respect, and take care not to cross: the boundary between God&#39;s domain and our own.&#34; ~ Adrian Valence

**Description:**

Adrian Valence is a slightly tall man in his thirties. His most memorable features are his well-kempt brown hair and matching brown beard, and his dull hazel eyes. Adrian is of average build, leaning ever-so-slightly towards the heavier side. He is almost never seen without his glasses, and will frequently adjust them while speaking.

Dr. Valence has, over the course of several years, achieved a triple PhD. in the fields of Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics. His cover job is as a Professor at ███████ University in [DATA EXPUNGED], but the full extent of his talent shows in his work with the SCP Foundation. Adrian&#39;s combination of expertise makes him the perfect researcher for electronics and computer based SCPs. He also works as a system administrator and analyst for the SCP Foundation&#39;s network.
