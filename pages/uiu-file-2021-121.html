[[tab Interview Log]]

**Interviewed:** Agent F. Wilson

**Interviewer:** Special Agent M. Johnson

**Foreword:** Agent Wilson was subject to mind-altering effects while investigating 2019-283, where information was forwarded to 2021-121. Agent Wilson was the head investigator of file 2019-283.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Special Agent Johnson:** So, what happened, Frank?

**Agent Wilson:** The fucker convinced me he was a part of the team, that&#39;s what. Had us all running through hoops to find the piece of shit, just so he could take her out. That was MY case, and the motherfucker killed her when we finally found her.

//[Agent Wilson grows visibly upset, reaching into his coat and pulling out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter.]//

**Agent Wilson:** You don&#39;t mind if I smoke, do you?

**Special Agent Johnson:** Feel free.

//[Agent Wilson lights a cigarette and inhales it, remaining silent for a moment.]//

**Agent Wilson:** We were staked out in front of the butcher shop where 283 worked. Had the whole place cased out and everything. Every door had a fuckin&#39; alarm system on it to make sure we knew when someone entered and exited. Cameras inside, hidden, of course. Everything but the meat locker. Stupid, I know.

**Special Agent Johnson:** And if the file is correct, the body was found inside of the meat locker, right?

**Agent Wilson:** Yeah. We were getting ready to go in and question 283 when one of our guys, Ramos, says that he should put cameras in the meat locker. I give the go ahead, and he walks down the hill and inside of the shop. We watch him on the cameras, see him go into the meat locker under the guise of a Department of Health inspector. 283 enters a few moments later, probably to grab a chunk of meat or some shit, and Ramos doesn&#39;t exit.

**Special Agent Johnson:** How long did you wait?

**Agent Wilson:** A good 10 minutes. After that, we got into gear and rushed inside. Headed straight for the meat locker. We open that shit up, look inside, and see 283 hanging with the end of the meathook between her eyes and another in her chest. Strung up like a fuckin&#39; puppet. 

**Special Agent Johnson:** And after that?

**Agent Wilson:** We clear the place of civilians, set up a crime scene, and look for Ramos. Nowhere to be found. Looks like he wasn&#39;t even there. Only thing we could find that related to him was his gun, which was on the ground next to the corpse. 

**Agent Wilson:** Autopsy comes back with signs of strangulation, along with the obvious meathook-related death. Neck bruised but not broken. Signs of a struggle as well, as she had bits of skin under her fingernails. 

**Special Agent Johnson:** And Ramos?

**Agent Wilson:** Never found him.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Agent Wilson has requested to be placed on psychiatric leave until 04/04/2021. Request approved.

[[tab Body Camera Footage]]

**&lt;Transcription provided via the Federal Records Act&gt;**

**Agents Involved:** Special Agent Michaelson, Special Agent Gutierrez, Agent Rodriguez, Agent Pauling

**Foreword:** Agents were dispatched for a monthly check-in with 2011-197, as provided by the regulations set by the UIU. 2011-197 was permitted to remain in the town of Ketchum, Idaho, so long as she did not use her anomaly, and kept her apartment free of flammable items.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

Agents approach the apartment where 2011-197 resides. Agent Michaelson knocks on the door. Approximately 1 minute passes before he knocks again.

Provided that 2011-197 is expected to be home during this time, Agent Pauling unlocks the door with the key she was provided with by 2011-197. Agents enter the home.

The home is sparsely decorated. All items inside are nonflammable, as according to the agreement set between UIU and 2011-197. Agent Rodriguez shouts to let 2011-197 know that they have entered. There is no response.

Agents disperse and begin to clear the apartment. Upon entering the bedroom, Agent Rodriguez discovers the corpse of 2011-197 on the bed, decapitated. Standing next to the bed is a Portuguese man.

**Agent Rodriguez:** Hey, Ramos, what&#39;s up?

**Ramos:** Just discovered the body. Was getting ready to set up a crime scene when you guys arrived. I&#39;ll head back to the office if you guys got it.

**Agent Rodriguez:** Yeah, we got it from here. Go ahead and go. Say hi to Jim, Jorge, and Samantha before you go.

**Ramos:** Will do.

Ramos exits the room, entering the living room.

**Special Agent Michaelson:** Hey, Ramos! Didn&#39;t expect to see you here!

**Ramos:** Yeah. Got here before you guys. Found the body in the bedroom. I&#39;d go take a look... Jim...? 

**Special Agent Michaelson:** Gotcha. Well, head on back to the office to fill out your report.

**Ramos:** Gotcha, boss man. See you around.

Agents enter the bedroom to set up a crime scene. Approximately 15 minutes pass before Agent Rodriguez asks who the male was. All other agents appear confused, before Agents Pauling and Michaelson exit the apartment to look for the male. By this time, the man has left the area.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**
