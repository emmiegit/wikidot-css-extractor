**Item #:** SCP-4518

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** A fence has been erected for the purpose of preventing entry into SCP-4518. Civilians attempting to enter SCP-4518 are to be detained, amnesticized, and released.

**Description:** SCP-4518 is an anomalous structure located at the end of the Old Halloway Boardwalk in San Francisco, California. 

SCP-4518 consists of a narrow tunnel passageway containing 207 posters for missing children -- primarily between the ages of 6-12 -- who disappeared from January 1st, 1975 to December 31st, 1999. Individuals who traverse SCP-4518 have reported inexplicable feelings of dread, somberness, or a sensation likened to &#34;falling off the edge of the world&#34;.

SCP-4518-1 is a Class-I spectral entity[[footnote]] Colloquially known as a ghost. [[/footnote]] residing at the end of SCP-4518, resembling a young child of indeterminate age, sex, or ethnicity. SCP-4518 displays symptoms of advanced depersonalization, often providing vague, unusual, or mystifying responses to attempts at interview. SCP-4518-1 is otherwise unremarkable.

**Addendum:** Interview attempt

After reviewing this document&#39;s supplementary materials during an unrelated research project, Dr. Elizabeth Espinoza -- then serving as Deputy Director of the Department of Spectral Affairs -- requested to speak with SCP-4518-1. Due to Dr. Espinoza&#39;s position within the DoSA, this request was granted. The following encounter was recorded shortly thereafter, and has been transcribed verbatim.

**File Update:** As of 4/24/2022, SCP-4518 now contains only 206 missing person posters. No individual by the name of &#34;Dr. Elizabeth Espinoza&#34; has ever been employed by the Foundation. Further investigation is ongoing.
