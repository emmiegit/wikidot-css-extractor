**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7212 is held in a standard Keter-class cell, located within the Heavy Containment Zone (West Wing) of Site-16. The frontal steel door has been welded shut, and the maintenance shaft (M-HC29a) directly accessing the chamber has been requisitioned as a funnel for forthcoming SCP-7212-1. 

The SCP-7212 containment team is to be regularly supplied with appropriate defensive materials and is staffed by tactical combat-ready personnel. An array of 10 KNAUER ABA-2B4 automatic sentry turrets have been installed at various strategic points within M-HC29a. Additional sentry turrets have been installed within --1-- 2 miles of SCP-7212&#39;s containment in anticipation of containment breaches.

Turrets are to be activated and and kept fully operational at all times, especially during any confirmed SCP-7212 conception event. After all SCP-7212-1 within M-HC29a have been neutralized, armed containment personnel must coat the resulting viscera in specialized hydrochloric chemical compound [[[scp-4910|HF/PURE]]] and transport the remaining material to I-HC177 for liquidation. 

Additionally, all containment and security personnel present during and following SCP-7212 conception events are to undergo Class 3 VMC sensory sedation processing. Persons of any Abrahamic faith are not to come within 100 meters of any 7212-1 instance. 

In the event of a containment breach, MTF Lambda-93 (&#34;Shaka Zulu&#34;) is tasked with tracking and terminating instances.

[[collapsible show=&#34;&#34;Letter to New Personnel,&#34; Officer Collie Streisand, HMCL&#34;]]

[[div class=&#34;notation&#34;]]

When I was a tike, I had a Jack Russel Terrier. She was only six years old by the time I graduated preschool. Instead of barking, she would make this strange, stunted laughing sound. All the kids made fun of my dog. I loved her, though. 

Her name was Cleopatra. She got run over by a garbage truck three days before Valentine&#39;s. Before I took a bullet to the knee and had to quit Shaka Zulu, I used to think back to Cleo&#39;s bark. Her &#34;laugh.&#34;

I can&#39;t do that anymore.

We&#39;re all bulkheads.[[footnote]] Colloquialism for Site-16 personnel. [[/footnote]] We&#39;ve all held a P90 at least once since we first walked past Mike.[[footnote]] Referring to the Archangel Michael sculpture in Site-16&#39;s above-ground lobby. [[/footnote]] Some of us were called over here just because we could tank a stab from an orange. We&#39;ve all heard stories about the ass clown, [[[scp-7575|the kid]]], [[[scp-689|the haunter]]], all that. I&#39;m also sure you&#39;ve heard stories about 7212.

The guns you&#39;ll be armed with aren&#39;t P90s. You will be given SIG LMG 6.8s. Our SIGs fire .277 caliber explosive rounds capable of puncturing 2.88 inches of tungsten. I was there when we tested it: the dead cow we used to measure the blasts had to be buried twice. These guns are heavily modified Foundation-standard, handheld, and weigh 17 pounds. 

Under no circumstances are you allowed to turn away from the kill shaft while you&#39;re holding these guns. That shaft is 67 meters long. At the end of those 67 meters is a 55 meter drop. That&#39;s where the Virgin Mary is. Her children can travel up that 55 and bolt across those 67 in approximately 6 seconds. 

When I was Shaka Zulu, they installed one of those sentry turrets next to my dorm. I didn&#39;t know why they were putting them so far from the chamber. When I asked why, they didn&#39;t tell me. They didn&#39;t have to tell me.

When I&#39;m stressed, I daydream. When I used to daydream, I used to think about Cleopatra. There was this one memory I was especially fond of where we played out in the snow. We played fetch. I remember being so impressed at her for bounding seamlessly across the snow like it was nothing. Now when I try remembering her, all I can see is a 7212-1 sprinting on all fours down the kill shaft.

Be grateful you are not the first line of fire. If anything, this job can be cushy when the things that come out of its cunt are just babies. Put on some noise-cancelling headphones and let the sentries do the work.

It was either this or doing lectures for the dweebs in Site-14. I vastly prefer having a heavy machine gun in my hands. Maybe you&#39;ll get used to the smell of blue cheese, too.

Aim for the head.

**Description:** SCP-7212 is a 1.74 m tall humanoid figure composed of an unidentified calcium curd. The object is of limited locomotion when unobserved. SCP-7212 superficially resembles a contemporary depiction of the Virgin Mary. The object is solid, however exhibits multiple pseudo-organic traits in the lower abdomen: notably, a 1.4 cm long, cartilaginous vagina is present in the crotch, which is capable of dilating up to 50 cm in diameter during conception events. This organ lacks a clitoris. A sallow, putrid-smelling, lactic substance has been frequently observed to rupture from this area during conceptions. Conception events produce live SCP-7212-1.

SCP-7212-1 bear genetic similarities to [[span class=&#34;redact&#34;]]REDACTED[[/span]]. They are organic, humanoid entities of variable appearance, always resembling male //Homo sapiens// of apparent Semitic ancestry. They possess mild to severe cognitohazardous properties. 7212-1 are hostile and capable of extreme violence. Although the exact physical measurements of the capabilities of 7212-1 have not been recorded, it is known that instances possess supernatural strength and dexterity, and will produce a loud [[[scp-2419|cackle]]] while pursuing victims; this sound has been recorded at over 270 dB. 7212-1 regenerate rapidly and exhibit minimal bleeding. Acute cranial trauma is required to efficiently terminate instances. SCP-7212 has been known to conceive broods of up to 8 adult 7212-1 at a time.

[[span class=&#34;add&#34;]]ADDENDUM 11-03-2019[[/span]] Recovery Incident 

On 11/03/2019, rancher Emily Guillemot observed the apparent creation of SCP-7212. She reported the incident to the Fresno County Police Department as it was occurring, making the following call.

A policeman was dispatched to the scene. Upon discovering instance SCP-7212-1-001aa, police officer Frank Chance was maimed and terminated. It took 16 minutes before Chance&#39;s absence was recognized by the police department. A SWAT team was summarily dispatched to the location, who also suffered heavy casualties. Upon recording 7212-001aa&#39;s supernatural traits, the SCP Foundation was alerted.

MTF Lambda-93 Tactical Team 4 was dispatched to the site. Based on the scant description of 7212-001aa and its capabilities, agents were mobilized with heavy weaponry. 

[[collapsible show=&#34;Interview AOL-7212-1&#34;]]

&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Zechariah Sybil
&gt; **Subject:** Agent Alexandria Vice, L-93 TacTeam 4
&gt; **Foreword:** Subject sustained traumatic injuries during the recovery of SCP-7212. Interview conducted during the treatment of these injuries.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sybil:** How are you feeling?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Vice:** It really hurts.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sybil:** I&#39;m sorry. If there&#39;s anything you need from me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Vice:** Yeah.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sybil:** Could you please explain your mission?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Vice:** Go in and grab the thing. No coghaz. They said a SWAT team was cut down.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sybil:** Please describe the recovery process.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Vice:** Ah. There was cackling from the get-go. Like a hyena. We were two yards from the house and, ah, we could hear it loud and clear. I phoned Command and they said they had [[span class=&#34;redact&#34;]]REDACTED[[/span]] under lockdown with Ennui pending. So we, ah, went in.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sybil:** There were no casualties, correct?
&gt; 
&gt; (Agent Vice grins.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Vice:** Damn right. Shaka Zulu, baby.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sybil:** Hah. 
&gt; 
&gt; (Silence on recording. Agent Vice&#39;s grin dissipates.) 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Vice:** Ah... hm... I watched the recording -- the, ah, recovery log -- and I still can&#39;t see where that thing even came from. It was fast. And that sound, Zech. That fucking cackling. Blew my fucking ears out. It&#39;s actually an, ah, a miracle none of us croaked. 
&gt; 
&gt; Logan and Will jumped to the side. The thing grabbed me. The, ah, 7212-1. And then it did... it did this.
&gt; 
&gt; (Agent Vice points to her leg.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Vice:** Hurt. Hurt bad. Ah. Kept me in the house, next to the dead lady and her kid. The kid was, ah, under the table, looking at me. Right at me. Hiding. Is... ah, Zech, is that kid--
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sybil:** There was a single survivor. A child.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Vice:** God. Thank god. That was all I could think about when it happened. I just hyper-focused on the kid. I didn&#39;t... ah... I didn&#39;t know what to do while it...
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sybil:** You don&#39;t have to describe any more, Agent.
&gt; 
&gt; (Silence on recording.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Vice:** Will I ever walk again?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sybil:** I don&#39;t have an answer to that.
&gt; 
&gt; (Silence on recording.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Vice:** Did they... did they get it out of my leg?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sybil:** Get what out of your leg?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Vice:** Its milk. Ah... It...
&gt; 
&gt; (Agent Vice begins stuttering. Dr. Sybil waits a moment before tenuously rising from their seat and approaching Agent Vice. They proceed to hug Agent Vice. Agent Vice&#39;s stammering ceases.)
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Sybil:** You promised me dinner after this.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Vice:** Heh. When I get out.

[[span class=&#34;add&#34;]]ADDENDUM 08-10-2019[[/span]] SCP-7212 was initially contained via a reinforced Keter-class containment chamber. The SCP-7212-1 instance sedated and contained during the object&#39;s recovery, 7212-1-001aa, was placed in cryogenic storage. 

CCTV security cameras were installed on the western and northern sides of SCP-7212&#39;s containment chamber. As the conception phenomenon of 7212-1 from SCP-7212 was unknown at the time, SCP-7212 was considered a Euclid-class Notice-risk object. SCP-7212 was to be monitored at all times by a rotating team of at least 4 security personnel stationed within the observation deck. 

On 08/10/2019, the first recorded conception of an SCP-7212-1 brood was witnessed by SCP-7212 containment personnel. 3 instances were produced in total; 1-002aa, 002ab, and 002ac. 002ab expired instantly due to an unnatural merge between the frontal lobe and the left arm, which exhibited polydactyly. Containment personnel issued a Code Yellow emergency at SCP-7212&#39;s containment and requested assistance. 

It is at this point that 002aa approached the hydraulically-sealed steel gate connecting the chamber to the outside. Staff witnessed 002aa inserting its fingers into the seam between the two doors. Over a course of approximately 2 minutes, 002aa pried the steel doors open with its hands, destroying its arms in the process. 

002aa and 002ac breached containment. A Code Red containment breach was declared and the observation deck locked down. 002aa sprinted towards HC-South while 002ac remained at the exterior window of the observation deck. 

Security footage shows 002ac severing its own head and throwing it through the plexiglass window into the observation deck. Rapid regeneration enabled the entity to terminate all 4 personnel. 

In HC-South, janitor Jo Green was sitting near Dr. Vermillion&#39;s office.  She was wearing noise-cancelling headphones and reading a hardback Spanish copy of //Crime and Punishment.// 002ac approached the subject and proceeded to [[span class=&#34;redact&#34;]][[[scp-3138|REDACTED]]][[/span]]. Her cadaver was later extracted.

MTF Lambda-93 was deployed into HC-South as the area was locked down. Personnel were advised to seek refuge in any available evacuation shelters. With minimal casualties, MTF agents were able to terminate the two breached instances.

The doors to SCP-7212&#39;s containment chamber were repaired and welded shut. As this took place immediately after the breach, 7212-1-002ab&#39;s cadaver had yet to be disposed of, under the assumption that it was inert. However, after the doors were welded together, 002ab reanimated. Unable to breach through its doors, 002ab instead utilized gross physical force to tunnel into M-HC29a. MTF L-93 agents faced the entity in combat within the maintenance shaft, suffering 8 injuries but terminating the instance for a second time.

The remains of all SCP-7212-1 were promptly doused with HF/PURE. SCP has since been revised, and M-HC29a has been requisitioned as a vital element of those procedures. 

----

[[span class=&#34;add&#34;]]ADDENDUM 01-05-2019[[/span]] Shortly after Collie Streisand&#39;s promotion to SCP-7212 HMCL, a new team of offensive containment personnel were appointed by her and Assistant Director Igoe. However, following the successful termination of SCP-7212-1-009aa, 009ab, 009ac, and 009ad, containment operative Bryan Scotts immediately began exhibiting unusual behavior during the removal of doused SCP-7212-1 cadavers from M-HC29a. 

The following interview was promptly conducted.

[[collapsible show=&#34;AOL-7212-028&#34;]]

&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Nicholas Rhodes
&gt; **Subject:** Officer Bryan Scotts
&gt; **Foreword:** [See Addendum.]
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** How are you feeling, Bryan?
&gt; 
&gt; [Unresponsive. Subject exhibits rapid eye movement.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** If you are unable to answer our questions, you may be placed into quarantine. Don&#39;t make us do that, please. It&#39;d be a shame.
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Scotts:** No. I&#39;m awake.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** I&#39;m aware. I&#39;m just wondering how you&#39;re feeling.
&gt; 
&gt; [Officer Scotts appears to hiccup.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Scotts:** Not good, doc. Not good.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** What happened to make you feel this way? Was it--
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Scotts:** That thing wasn&#39;t--
&gt; 
&gt; [Silence on recording. Officer Scotts continues to hiccup.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Well, we--
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Scotts:** No. No, no, no, no, no. That wasn&#39;t him. It couldn&#39;t be.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** What do you mean by that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Scotts:** M--... Muh... Muh...
&gt; 
&gt; [Officer Scotts&#39; &#34;hiccups&#34; increase in frequency and strength. He begins moving from his chair.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Scotts:** Mother Mary! [convulsing] Mother Mary!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Rhodes:** Are you alright?
&gt; 
&gt; [As Officer Scotts&#39; movements become more erratic and violent, Dr. Rhodes physically distances himself from the subject.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Scotts:** H-He came down! He came down and he--
&gt; 
&gt; [Screaming.]
&gt; 
&gt; **Officer Scotts:** Cheese! Cheese! Cheese!
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Afterword:** While in the Medical Ward, Officer Scotts would repeatedly go on lengthy diatribes on how “he was never breastfed as a child.&#34;

[[/collapsible]]

Notably, Bryan Scotts was found to be the only member of the SCP-7212 containment team subscribed to an Abrahamic faith (Catholicism). SCP has since been revised.

----

[[span class=&#34;add&#34;]]ADDENDUM 10-04-2021[[/span]] SCP-7212-1 instances 017aa and 017ab conceived. Both instances emerged juvenile, approximately 1-7 years old. 017ab neutralized per standard protocol. 

Instance 017aa was resilient and extremely hostile. 2 members of the SCP-7212 containment team were severely injured by the instance before it escaped its containment area. MTF L-93 were dispatched into the Heavy Containment Zone to combat the instance. 

[[include component:image-block name=antichrist.png|caption=SCP-7212-1-017aa|width=150px]]

Upon confrontation, 017aa maimed and terminated Agent Ryder within 2 minutes. Agents Willcox and Toledo were terminated within 10 minutes of combat. Security footage shows 017aa pulling what appeared to be a two-handed sword from an apparent spacial breach or pocket dimension. This weapon appeared to absorb the majority of light which contacted its surface, appearing as a pitch black silhouette, with the &#34;portal&#34; from which 017aa produced the weapon appearing similar. 

017aa used this weapon to swiftly terminate Agents Costello, Richardson, and Wong. A separate L-93 TacTeam was dispatched to assist the initial group, and after 36 minutes of combat, instance 017aa was neutralized. The weapon was confiscated for research, however &#34;disintegrated&#34; 2 hours after the instance&#39;s death. 

Additional sentry turrets have been installed within 2 miles of the SCP-7212 containment zone. SCP revised.

----

[[span class=&#34;add&#34;]]ADDENDUM 07-07-2023[[/span]] SCP-7212 conceives 7212-1-122ag and 7212-1-122af. Instance 1-122ag terminated as normal. However, instance 1-122af remained within the containment cell. Using SCP-7212&#39;s lactive excrement, 1-122af produced a line of text on the northern wall of the chamber before expiring. Cause of death was found to be malnutrition. The following was translated from Aramaic:
