**GALLIO:** This is Agent Hector Gallio. The following is classified Level 5 under Project: SERAPIS — O5 EYES ONLY.

Research into anomalous events in the Shibbet’s Vale area of Southern Montana have turned up references to an incident that occurred at the Camp Apesawa summer camp in the summer of 1974. This was the unsolved disappearance of four children while staying at the camp. They were: Sally Aspinall, 12; Roberta Little, 11, known as ‘Bobbi’; Pearl Krause, 10; and Margaret Pendlemore, 10, known as ‘Maggie’. 

The four girls vanished one night, evidently having left their cabin at the campsite of their own accord. They were never found, and no one was ever found responsible for their disappearance. The prevailing law enforcement theory was that they entered the woods for a prank or on a dare, and became lost, after which they died of exposure or animal attack. However, the fact that no bodies were ever found despite the extensive search led to persistent theories of foul play or a cover-up on the part of the camp staff.

That summer, Camp Apesawa was host to around fifty children and seven staff members and counsellors. Prior to the disappearances, there were no notable incidents, nor had there been for the past few years of the camp’s operation. The four girls were housed in the same cabin, and were designated the ‘Blue Herons’ in the camp’s system of dividing the campers into small groups for activities. The disappearance occurred on the fourth night of the camp, and afterwards the rest of the children were sent home as the search effort got underway.

My research into the incident through Foundation channels recovered a curious footnote to the disappearances. In 2002, Jennifer Krause, the mother of Pearl Krause, was dying of emphysema and admitted on her deathbed that she had found evidence pertaining to the disappearances while aiding the search effort. She told her niece, whose married name was Gertrude Foss, that she had found Pearl’s backpack in the forest, and that inside were journals and unsent correspondence from all four girls. 

After reading some of the journals, Jennifer had decided not to inform the authorities and instead kept this evidence herself. After Jennifer Krause’s death, her niece informed the Montana State Police of this evidence, but the police failed to follow up on it. It was from their records that I was able to discover the existence of this evidence, and I directly approached Gertrude Foss claiming to be from the state police’s case review unit.

Shortly after this, I received a set of facsimiles of the evidence Jennifer Krause had found regarding the disappearance of her daughter and three other children. This evidence, along with the results of the police investigation at the time, forms the basis of my research into this incident and any possible anomalous aspects. Gertrude Foss is the only person outside the Foundation believed to have seen this evidence, and her communications are under Foundation surveillance to determine if this information has reached anyone else.

Dear Mom &amp; Dad. I am in a cabin with three other girls. Bobbi, Pearl and Maggie. The counsellor said I have to be extra nice to Bobbi because she’s black, and I’m the oldest so I’m the role model. Pearl is kind of a tomboy and Maggie’s real quiet. I think they’ll do what I say.
@@ @@
On the first day the camp leader sang the Camp Apesawa song and then we all learned the names of the girls in our cabin. We all made headdresses with feathers and did a raindance. It was kind of dumb but the little kids enjoyed it I guess. Then we went for a walk around the camp and the forest. I saw a deer! Pearl said I didn’t, but I did.

I caught a frog by the creek near the camp. No one saw me. It was so tiny, but so complicated. The insides were like watch parts. The little lungs and the heart, smaller than the nail on my pinky finger. This one had eggs in it. They looked like a wad of chewed-up gum. Luckily I was able to keep my knife on me, even though we’re not allowed. It was sharp enough so the skin didn’t tear. It was real pretty. I wish I hadn’t had to bury it afterwards.

There are wild cats and deer in the woods. Even bears! I don’t think I can catch a bear, and probably not a deer, but maybe I’ll find an injured one or a baby. Lots of birds, too, but I can’t catch those. Unless I make a snare.

Dear dad,
@@ @@
Camp was strange today. In the morning we played lacrosse. The counsellors put some of the cabins together in a team. Us Blue Herons were with the Bighorns and the Lynxes. It was very tiring and we ran around a lot. We lost the game. Of course the counsellors said it’s the taking part that counts, not the winning, but then why do we keep score?
@@ @@
Afterwards we were supposed to go swimming. But one of the girls said Pearl should change on her own because she looks like a boy. Pearl said the girl looked like a horse, which wasn’t nice but was also kind of true. 
@@ @@
Pearl gets angry real easy. She’s not strong or tough, but I think she wants to be. She’s so scared of people thinking she’s weak, she will do dumb things to try to prove she isn’t.
@@ @@
The other girl shoved her and Pearl shoved back, but the girl just laughed at her and called her puny. So Pearl picked up a lacrosse stick and swung it around like a baseball bat. The counsellors shouted at her and the camp leader ran out, and said all the Blue Herons have to sit in their cabin while everyone else swims. Pearl was real mad by then, her face all red. She was shouting. Sally was angry with her, too, because she had wanted to swim.
@@ @@
Pearl ran off past the trees. The counsellor said we had to go and get her. So me, Sally and Bobbi went to find her. We heard her crying and Sally started yelling again. Sally’s almost as scared as Pearl is of what people think. 
@@ @@
When we got to Pearl, we saw she was at a place where the forest**@@...@@** changed. All around the camp it’s dark green pine trees. But here, the place Pearl had run to, it was bright green, like a jungle. There were flowers all over the trees, and brightly coloured birds in the branches. I’m sure I saw an orange snake in the plants on the ground, and a deer that had eyes all bright and glittery like a fly’s.
@@ @@
Pearl was standing there, staring at everything, like we all were. She had been crying but she had stopped when she saw this place. 
@@ @@
Bobbi stopped staring first. She went to one of the trees and started climbing it. Sally picked some of the flowers. Pearl was just standing there.
@@ @@
I had a really bad feeling. It was the same feeling in my stomach as when mom told me she was getting sick. It was so wrong, this place. The others were too excited to feel it, but I could.
@@ @@
Bobbi found fruit in the tree and climbed down with her arms full of them. They were like fat white pears. She said they’d found a whole new species of fruit and they would name it after her. And she said, come on, let’s eat them.
@@ @@
And I shouted, ‘No!’ The others looked at me like it was the first thing I’d ever said. I couldn’t really put my bad feeling into words so I said, ‘don’t you remember what you were taught about natural places? Don’t eat strange fruit or berries, they might be poisonous!’ Bobbi said I should just try one, just a little bit, and I stamped my foot and said no again. I said if we didn’t leave this place and go back to the camp, I would tell everyone about it and then Bobbi wouldn’t have her stupid fruit named after her. 
@@ @@
Sally agreed we should go. But Pearl insisted we should return tomorrow, when no one would know we were in the forest. Bobbi said it was our own special place, with its own plants and animals no one had ever seen before, and we couldn’t just forget about it. I just wanted to get out of there, so I agreed, and we all walked back to the camp.
@@ @@
I’m thinking a lot about that place. The other girls are sleeping right now while I’m writing this, but I can’t sleep. How did those strange plants all come to grow there? It even felt warmer than the forest around it, like we’d walked onto a tropical island somehow. And what about the strange animals? The deer with the strange eyes. The bright birds. And I think I saw a bunny in the forest on the first day that had eight legs, like a furry bug. I thought I’d imagined it, but now I don’t know. 
@@ @@
The forest and mountain feel different. The lake, too. Like I wasn’t really there, but looking at a picture. I can’t really write it down so it makes sense. Like you always say, dad, I think too much. But this time it’s not just thinking. It’s feeling, too.  
@@ @@
So summer camp is very strange. Not at all what I expected.

I hope you were able to visit mom again. Please write me if she wakes up.

Lots of love, Maggie.

Everyone here is so stupid. The other kids are stupid, the counsellors are stupid, the camp leader is extra stupid. The other Blue Herons are stupid, too.
@@ @@
That girl at lacrosse was being a huge B-word but I got in trouble for it! All dumb Sally cared about was her not getting to swim in the stupid lake, not at all about me! I should have just hit that girl upside the head with the lacrosse stick so they would send me home and I wouldn’t have to be at this stupid place any more.
@@ @@
Then we found that awesome place, and stupid Maggie made us go back to the camp! At least I made them promise to come back.
@@ @@
Next day was stupid arts and crafts. We made stuff with pipe cleaners and construction paper like a bunch of babies. Maggie said the counsellors were trying to keep us from anything too energetic after my ‘display’ yesterday so I told her to shut up. I made a sword but the counsellor said that was too aggressive for a girl, so I started to make a gun instead and she let me have the sword.
@@ @@
We had free time that afternoon, so we all went back to the place in the forest. Even Maggie came. I don’t know why, if she’s so scared of it. 
@@ @@
It was still like it was before. It was so bright and colourful, like the pictures in a book. There was a bunch of butterflies that flew around me when I walked in. They were silver and gold, and they flashed in the light. 
@@ @@
We walked deeper into the forest. It went on for a long time. The branches got thicker and closed over us so it was like walking through a tunnel. There was more fruit in the trees, hanging in big bunches. They’re kind of like eggplants, but white. Bobbi picked some and Maggie argued we shouldn’t eat them again, but Sally told her off for trying to tell everyone what to do. 
@@ @@
So I said, you’re all a bunch of babies, and I took one of the fruit from Bobbi and took a big bite.
@@ @@
It tasted like fireworks on my tongue. I almost fell down, it was so amazing! I felt dizzy and had to stare down at my feet, and when I looked up again, I was in front of a huge clearing in the forest. It was like the big church my mom took me and my brothers to in the city. The high ceiling, all dark and shadowy where the light didn’t reach. 
@@ @@
In the clearing was a building like those old Roman ones, with columns. It was all ruined. There was a statue in the middle of it. The statue was of a lady. It was much taller than me, bigger than life-size. It was made from stone. She had a bird in each of her hands and there were flowers growing in her hair. They grew out of her body, too, as if they were sprouting from her skin. 
@@ @@
The other girls weren’t there but for some reason that didn’t worry me. This lady, the statue, she turned to look at me. And I wasn’t afraid, even though it was a statue moving. She said, what is your name?
@@ @@
I told her my name was Pearl. And she said, no, it is not.
@@ @@
I hate being called Pearl. It’s such a dumb old lady name. It means stuff like ‘modest’ and ‘pure’ which is what people want girls to be, but I don’t want to be. When I get old enough I’m going to change it to Amelia, like Amelia Earhart, or Annie, like Annie Oakley. Something tougher and less babyish. 
@@ @@
And this statue lady, she knew. So I said I hadn’t decided what my name was. She said, my child, what is this body you must carry around with you? I told her I hated it, my body was small and puny. 
@@ @@
Then she walked towards me. The bird in her hand flew off and landed on my shoulder. She put her heavy stone hand on my other shoulder. She leaned in close. I could see more flowers opening up on her body and roots growing under her skin. 
@@ @@
She said, we change. We grow. And we become what we desire. Just step outside the prison of your world.
@@ @@
I got dizzy again, and this time I fell over. Maggie was standing over me saying something. It took me a minute to be able to understand her. She said Bobbi had eaten one of the fruit after I did, and she had run off. 
@@ @@
I didn’t tell them about the temple and the statue lady. Sally was already shouting for Bobbi. I got up and followed them. Sally said she had seen Bobbi run off into a kind of side tunnel made out of the tree trunks. The trees were covered in these beetles with bright red and blue shells. Light was coming from lumps of fungus. It was hanging from the trees and glowing.
@@ @@
We saw a hole in the ground ahead of us. It was like the entrance to a gopher hole but way, way bigger. You could have driven a car into it. Bobbi was sitting on the edge of it, dangling her legs. 
@@ @@
She said to me, did you see the lady? I said yes. And then Bobbi looked at me all weird and said, did you see what was looking after her? I said I didn’t know what she meant. Maggie went up to her a little ways and told her to get back from the hole, but Bobbi didn’t move. She said there were things on the mountain, and in the mountain and under the earth, that no one had ever seen. Animals and plants that she would be the very first person to find out about. 
@@ @@
Then Sally shouted at Bobbi. She said, what does it matter if you have some dumb animal named after you? And, why was she being so weird?
@@ @@
Bobbi jumped up and shouted back, you didn’t see her! You don’t know what she is!
@@ @@
I really thought little Bobbi was about to try to fight Sally, but then something came out of the hole. It was a huge long thing twisted like a rope that wound around Bobbi and picked her up off her feet. It was dark grey and all wrinkled and warty like old skin. I could hear it rumbling and slithering beneath us. Bobbi yelped and suddenly she was dragged down the hole and vanished.
@@ @@
We all screamed, and ran. We were tripping over roots and bumping our heads on the branches. We got cuts and grazes all over, but we never even noticed until we ran out of the place where the strange plants were and into the regular forest. 
@@ @@
The other girls didn’t notice anything was wrong. The counsellors were having a pow-wow, which is where they play songs on a guitar and all the kids have to sit and listen. Some of the others were just running around in the woods. We ran back to our cabin to decide what to do next.

But I couldn’t stop them. Pearl and Bobbi both ate the fruit. They both saw something. Then Bobbi ran off and got taken underground by that monster. That’s all I can call it, a monster beneath the ground.

When we got back to the camp, I didn’t know what to do. Neither did Pearl. Sally did, though. She said we have to go back and get Bobbi. I was about to tell her not to, but then I realised she’s right. We didn’t know each other before camp, and we wouldn’t have been friends if the camp hadn’t put us together in the Blue Herons, but that didn’t matter. We had to look after each other. We were responsible. One of us was in danger and it was up to us to save her. Like soldiers, or firemen, or police. We didn’t have to be best friends. We just had to be people, looking out for each other.

Sally said we had to arm ourselves, so we went to the shed where the counsellors kept the sports equipment. We got some lacrosse helmets and nets, and a hockey stick. I wasn’t sure they would help against a monster but I didn’t say anything.

I asked Pearl what she saw, but she wouldn’t say. I knew it was something about a lady. Pearl seemed shaken up. I hadn’t seen her like that before. She didn’t even seem to mind that Sally was telling us what to do.

I’m writing this in the cabin. Sally is lacing on some shin pads. Pearl is finding rocks outside she can use with a slingshot she snuck into camp. I don’t know what we’ll find when we go into the forest again, or whether we’ll even find Bobbi at all.

Dear dad.
@@ @@
There’s a lot to explain. I should start with what happened when we went after Bobbi.
@@ @@
We went back to the grove, but it had changed. The branches of the trees had grown long and thin, like ropes, and they tried to grab and snare us as we went past. We had to hit them with the hockey and lacrosse sticks to get past. The birds flew at us and the bugs crawled over us, but we kept going.
@@ @@
We reached the tunnel of trees, and got to the hole in the ground. Between the trees I think I saw a bear with its fur pale grey. It was gungy and wet, and it had too many eyes and legs. I saw the deer with the insect eyes, like Sally had seen when we first got here. 
@@ @@
We reached the hole in the ground. We hadn’t seen any sign of Bobbi. Sally went down the hole first. It was steep, and we had to half-slide down it. It tore up our clothes and we were covered in cuts and dirt when we got to the bottom. Pearl had brought a flashlight so we could see. We were in a tunnel, with walls all smooth like something had made them by burrowing, instead of like a natural cave.
@@ @@
We went down the tunnel, and it branched, and then again. I told Sally we could easily get lost down there if we didn’t think about where we were going. I said we should stop, and listen.
@@ @@
We could hear it breathing. It was far away, but huge and loud. There was a deep thud, too, like something really heavy being dropped every few seconds. I think it was the thing’s heartbeat. 
@@ @@
We followed the sound, being as quiet as we could. Eventually we got to where the tunnel was full of plants like ferns, and bunches of the white fruit. It was difficult to push forward through the plants. I think plants need light to live, which made me wonder how they could survive down here in the dark.
@@ @@
Then we reached a huge cave, full of plants. The flashlight couldn’t reach the ceiling. The thing’s breathing was as loud as a wave on the ocean. The air was warm and damp.  
@@ @@
Then we saw it. I can’t say exactly how big it was, because the flashlight only showed some of it. The thing it looked most like was a worm, but a gigantic one, so big it could have easily swallowed a school bus. It smelled like wet earth and the forest floor in Fall, when the leaves start to rot.
@@ @@
Its mouth opened. It was like a huge circle of muscle. Tentacles came out, the same kind that had grabbed Bobbi. Each one was as thick as a tree trunk. There were eight or ten of them. They slithered out, poking around through the plants. I think it knew we were there, and it was trying to find us.
@@ @@
The whole worm moved like it was waking up. 
@@ @@
Sally stood out in front with her lacrosse stick in both hands, and shouted, ‘give her back!’
@@ @@
I was sure the worm was going to eat her. It could have snatched her up with those tentacles and reeled her back into its mouth. But instead the mouth opened wide, and the tentacles spread open like a flower, and there standing in its mouth was Bobbi. 
@@ @@
She said for us not to be scared that she wanted to be there and that the lady inside the worm was going to take her in and give her everything Bobbi wanted. 
@@ @@
I didn’t know what I should say. Part of me knew I should be terrified, and screaming like a girl in a horror movie, but all I could do was stand there and watch. Bobbi walked out of the worm and picked one of the white fruit growing from the plants in the cave. She told us that we owed it to the lady to hear her out, and that eating the fruit would let her talk to us. 
@@ @@
Sally said we should do it. Maybe we could convince this lady to let Bobbi go. And we had to take all the chances we could to get Bobbi back, because imagine the trouble we would be in if we were supposed to be responsible for her, and we lost her! So Sally took the fruit, and I took one, too, and Pearl, who had eaten one before. 
@@ @@
It tasted so strange. It was kind of fizzy, but not like sherbert. More like I imagine electricity tastes. I almost fainted, and when the dizziness stopped I was on the top of a mountain, way above the clouds. But I wasn’t cold, and I could breathe just fine. I could see so far, all the way to the shore of the ocean, and all the way along a line of huge mountains with snow all over them. There were forests and rivers and lakes below. 
@@ @@
The lady was on top of the mountain with me. Her skin was the same pale colour as the fruit, with the same green veins. Her hair was leaves like ferns. She was very beautiful. I asked why she had taken Bobbi, and she told me she hadn’t taken anyone, and she never did. She was attended by people who chose to be there. She was very powerful, she said, and she could give us all what we wanted, so we would want to stay and serve her. I wasn’t so sure about that, but then she said she knew what I wanted.

I’m really sorry, Daddy, I know you try really hard and it’s not easy without mom. But you’re just not good at being a dad. I know it’s not nice to say it, but you know it’s true.

[[collapsible hideLocation=&#34;both&#34; show=&#34;SHOW — COMMENTARY — DR. GALLIO: Camp Apesawa Writings [CLASSIFIED 5/SERAPIS]&#34; hide=&#34;− HIDE&#34;]]
**GALLIO:**

The case of the Camp Apesawa disappearances has been cold for more than forty years. Even if the evidence of the girls’ writings was available to the police at the time of their vanishing, it is unlikely in the extreme it would have been acted on, or seen as anything other than a shared delusion or work of fantastical fiction by the girls. Only an organisation such as the Foundation could countenance the girls’ last writings as being possibly true.

After reading these journal entries and unsent letters, Pearl Krause’s mother decided to keep their contents to herself. I cannot conclude whether what she did was wrong or right, but I will say it is understandable for a person in severe emotional distress when presented with such an impossible story and its implications. 

The events at Camp Apesawa in 1974 can be interpreted as a confirmed sighting of SCP-6881. It is also reasonable to suggest a link between the four missing girls, and the four girls who appeared at Scarslow and the camp site in 1981. However, if they are the same girls, they did not age in the intervening seven years. 

Of particular interest is the entity the girls claim to have encountered and spoken with, and which was possibly responsible for their disappearance. Whether this is a corporeal entity or was purely a creation of a group hallucination is impossible to determine from the evidence the girls left behind. For this reason, I have not given it a provisional SCP designation. However, further research into the history of Shibbet’s Vale will make a particular point of seeking out more information about the entity. On a personal note, I feel the girls’ writings have brought me the closest yet to the source of the anomalous history of Shibbet’s Vale.

It would not be right for me to simply give up on ever finding the four girls again. Ethically, we should try to find them, and their families should know what happened, even if they can never believe it. But I fear if we ever did find them, they would be something very different from four young girls who went to summer camp. Something both recognisable as those same girls, but also completely and awfully different.

This concludes my research into the events at Camp Apesawa in 1974. This information is classified Level 5 -- O5-12 EYES ONLY. Agent Hector Gallio, signing off.
