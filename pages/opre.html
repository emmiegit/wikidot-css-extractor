This is an ode to the coin in my boot. A prayer to the bells above my mother&#39;s doorway. A love letter to a Motherland I have never seen and a dirge for every child ripped from their father&#39;s arms. I feel like I&#39;ve walked forever and a day, but I&#39;ve never once left home. Blessed are we vagrants, damned as we are to roam. 

I remember how my mother looked at me when I set out on my own. Out of five children, the second youngest was the first to leave home. Beneath all her fear, I could tell she was proud. 

&#34;The world is cruel&#34;, she warned me, &#34;but give it time&#34;. 

My other mother just pressed a coin into my palm; she was never one to mix words. 

Its been a dozen seasons since then, and it&#39;ll be a dozen more before I know where I&#39;m going. My path was charted long ago. My destination dreamed into being by ancestors whose names I&#39;ll never know. Generations carried forward by a common goal: peace and joy for all our kin. Opre Roma. May we all find our way home.</textarea></pre>
