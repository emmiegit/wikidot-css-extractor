I... About the thing, last night.

Tayler&#39;s lying flat on her bed, staring up at the ceiling as the arm she holds her phone with slinks over the edge.

The smoke from the rite is effusive. It&#39;s billowing around the ceiling fan, crawling over its still blades with hands of nebulaic luminescence. She&#39;d turn the fan on -- sitting in here is like hotboxing in a sulfur mine (to the degree she thinks she understands what hotboxing is) -- but doing so would be more likely to disrupt the rite than clear the air. So many lines of shattered gems, of burnt memorabilia, of tears flowing through sigil conduits and obsidian obelisks. It&#39;s so fragile that even the smallest thought feels poised to knock it apart.

If Tayler looks closely, the smoke seems to have starlight in it -- flashes of white, pink, blue. Nova must&#39;ve spent some time customizing the aesthetics of this so it looked better than it smelled.

She&#39;s not thinking about her body. Well, no. She is. She&#39;s thinking about it a lot. Longer eyelashes, thinner eyebrows, weeb-red hair, equally weeb-red eyes, a body that doesn&#39;t feel like it was designed to be a blocky rectangle, an actual form that feels like //hers.// This is everything she&#39;s wanted, everything she&#39;s wanted for so many years that none of this even feels like reality.

However, above it all, is one, nagging thought:

She already cried her eyes out -- that&#39;s been done for hours now.

She already told her friends online -- most of them are offline now.

She already zoned the hell out on her bed -- she does that every single day of her life.

Mom&#39;s been fast asleep and the house is empty, but it&#39;s such a boring cube of suburban dross that there&#39;s nothing worth doing beyond this room. There&#39;s always the world outside to navigate, assuming the dross miraculously turns fun when you&#39;re newly girled-up and bored out of your mind. Or...

Oh.

Right.

She&#39;s a girl now. A fourteen year-old girl. In a suburb. At nighttime. With no physical strength or defensive magic. Going outside would be the second-most dumbassed course of action she could take, only a rank below pulling this shapeshifting stunt when Dad could get back home...

No, don&#39;t think about that.

Shut it.

Pushing internal thoughts to the wayside, Tayler pulls up her phone, clicking it out of sleep mode and reopening the chat client. She scrolls up past a log of unrelated talk, some conversation about that one webcomic everyone seems to fawn over, and finds the messages sent right before she said she&#39;d actually do something (that was an hour ago -- nice going).

She sees what Lilith and Nova sent.

Lilith wasn&#39;t lucky. Ze never talks about zir childhood, though there&#39;s enough at the outskirts of what ze says to imply that no, there was never luck in zir circumstances, not by a long shot of the term. It may have actually been offensive to say that --godsdammit.--

Regardless of the past, the abilities are something Lilith takes pride in. Whatever loopholes in reality ze slipped through brought zir to a spot where ze&#39;s happy. A spot where ze never has to vent about gender dysphoria, or toil for weeks and weeks trying to complete the simplest ritual. Lilith never has to deal with any of that because ze already //has// dealt with it. Ze dealt with it //all on zir own.//

Can she be like that?

= Figure something out.

The rite is still burning. If the smoke is the hands then the flames are the arms, appendages reaching from candlewax joints to play the strings of existence and shift the pitch of its rhythm. The fire itself does not damage the surroundings -- it&#39;s little more than an afterimage, a projection of a might moving beyond Tayler&#39;s senses, its structure rationalized into the only analogous concept the brain knows. A force of change and erasure; a force of cleansing and empowering.

None of this has a mind. It&#39;s essentially a machine built to fit aetheric specifications. Set the ritual sequences right and it does all the work you could never do on your own. However, the longer you are around its joints the more you can recognize how those joints are assembled. It&#39;s like Lilith said: twist your mind to the right angle, receive the right signal; a signal of everything you can&#39;t yet see.

To Tayler&#39;s benefit, she has practice -- her mind is already in the right place. When her eyes close she can trace the phantom outlines the machine traces in its path. And, if she listens closely, the sound of the strings.

She drops her phone, breathing deep into her lungs. Whiffs of the smoke catch in her windpipe, scraping against the sides. She hacks, wheezing into the crook of her arm, but she tries again, inhaling her head pointed to the wall flanking her bed, where no smoke has congregated. Her breath turns cyclic, her pulse rhythmic. The softness of the bed is a cushion to the nerves, the outlines of the machine false constellations to her vision. Reality lightens, lightens, lightens. Her consciousness slips from its shackles--

instead of lingering in the physical world she lunges to the layer above it, astral form shooting through seas of crystalline starlight that flow like rivers around her eyes.

in an infinitesimal fraction of a second she&#39;s yanked back, bouncing across the crystals and leaving ripples in her path. her Soul is still too bound to her Body to ever go to a higher layer than this. without knowing how to cut the tethers between the two she&#39;s forced to solely venture through the innermost periphery of physical Existence, the shortest gap imaginable.

the reflections in the ripples tell her everything she already needs to know, though. she&#39;s as high as she needs to be. around her shift the stygian blue limbs of the Rite.

The code Lilith added enters effect. Tayler&#39;s body is trapped in a cyclone of light as her soul becomes a conduit for energy wells farther than the peripheral and the peripheral&#39;s peripheral and a thousand more layers in between. It&#39;s siphoned directly into her soul where it bounces in her astral grip like a spark. The strings aren&#39;t necessary anymore the strings are dwarfed by the trumpeting dynamo now reaching her.

= She&#39;s in control.

= She&#39;s in //control.//

She laughs with giddiness, happy to finally have met the day where she can kiss dysphoria goodbye truly and permanently.

= //What to do first?//

= //What to do first?//

So many ideas race through her head. Too much to keep track of, trains of thought slipping by right as new ones stream in. It&#39;s a collision between the qualia of normalcy and the data of ascension.

Finally, an aesthetic sticks to her. An aesthetic that, by all counts and means, fits perfectly.

= //Wings.//

Blades of light sprout from her shoulders. They cut like scythes through the air, threshing at a slowly dwindling visage of humanity. From the edges spring forth feathers from which further wings sprout, like fractals.

= //Red.//

Hair as red as lava, hair as bright as plasma. The color spectra burns and crumbles under the brightness.

= //Eyes.//

Third eye for now, more to come.

= //Light.//

It&#39;s all her body is.

= //Flight.//

She can finally see all her friends now.

= //Sight.//

She doesn&#39;t have to prognosticate to know where her future is headed from here.

= //Life.//

She&#39;s going to be happy now.

= //Life.//

She&#39;s going to be herself now.

= //Life.//

She&#39;s going to be--

//crumble.//

//crumble, crumble, crumble.//

Past the house, a car with a hidden layer of bulletproof plating crunches over the asphalt. It glides to a halt on the street, gently turning, reversing onto the driveway. The garage door clicks and whirs open; the car slides in, engine whirring off.

= //Dad.//

The tether snaps down. Tayler&#39;s soul screams through the crystal starlight and shears a jagged wake in her path as she slams into physicality. Her body drops. The lights and wings, their power supply cut, sputter out.

= //No no no, if I just had another second, if I// just didn&#39;t panic--

From downstairs is the faint clunk of the front door opening. Even if her siphon is gone the rite is still operating and playing the strings. She can&#39;t clean it up in time. She can&#39;t hide the components. She can&#39;t clear out the smoke. None of the doors have locks if he heard any noise he&#39;d

= --you&#39;re a fuckup tayler--

Channeling the last of her energy into a single finger flick she rends a hole through the air and, in a swing of her hand, fires the entire rite upwards. The smoke glitters in an arcing, fading trail through the astral crystals, when,

= --you can&#39;t do anything right--

without a sound,

= --you can&#39;t even manage when Lilith hands the keys right to you--

the hole closes shut.

= --you deserve this.--

Tayler scrambles across her bed to hit the light switch, making it right as footfall creaks up the last steps of the stairwell. Curling into a fetal position, breathing staccato, she braces.

The door to her parents&#39; bedroom opens, hangs still. Then, after a soundless interstice, it closes.

Tayler breathes. She doesn&#39;t try to get up. She doesn&#39;t try to check how she looks. She already knows.

She lies on her bed, motionless, for several hours.

Tayler gets one hour of sleep.

An afterimage of wings is in her eyes when she gets up. She jams a torn binder with a sheath of worksheets, pencil scribbled everywhere except for the answer spaces, and drops it in her bag, dragging it over her shoulders as she exits her room. Dad&#39;s already left -- the remnants of his breakfast rest on the downstairs kitchen table. Mom&#39;s still here -- she tells Tayler to get --his-- shit together. --He-- already has. They get in their car.

As Mom drives Tayler starts to speak about --his-- talk with dad. --He&#39;s-- interrupted a second in.

&#34;You trust him, right?&#34;

&#34;...&#34;

&#34;Right?&#34;

&#34;Yes.&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s my son.&#34; She&#39;s smiling.

Tayler&#39;s dropped off at school several minutes later. She doesn&#39;t do shit. Glue eyes to the chalkboard, slip worksheets into the trashcan before class, keep lips shut. Not like she&#39;d ever want to hear her voice in the first place. When lunch arrives, she slips beneath a stairwell to huddle in the firelight glow of her phone screen, and once it&#39;s over, she returns to the routine.

One of the teachers berates --him-- for missing assignments repeatedly. --He-- says --he&#39;ll-- do better next time.

When school ends she sits by the curb, fingers tapping against her phone. The November breeze stings, brushing across her like a needle dragged across a wound. --Like a scalpel-- It blows harder into her eyes but she doesn&#39;t turn away; with the vantage she&#39;s got, she can see straight down the first stretch of the road leading to home. Any second now a new car should be cruising over the tarmac, pulling up and blocking the cold with its chassis. Any second now it&#39;ll get here, and she&#39;ll find herself --back where she&#39;ll always be.--

The breeze tumbles around her hands. She keeps tapping, --sterilized steel prying in.--

It takes twenty minutes for Tayler to realize that Mom isn&#39;t coming to pick her up.

Avoiding the glances of the few still-remaining students on the block, she walks away.

Radio waves pass through her soul. Practicing with astral projection so much exercises the tethers binding Tayler&#39;s self to her body, building the strength needed to push it and pull it past her body more than normal. A quarter of her is inside her dad&#39;s portable radio; the rest is staring at a math worksheet and pretending the symbols aren&#39;t alien.

Through the encrypted datastreams are the responses of half a conversation.

Clump clump clump. Tayler tugs her soul together and stares at the paper as her dad ascends the staircase, stomps down the hallway, and twists his bedroom door. For a moment he pauses, stepping the opposite direction towards Tayler&#39;s door. A moment passes without sound. Then he heads the other way and exits.

Tayler, letting her pencil clatter to a canvas of graphite scribbles, trudges into bed and shuts off the lights.

Fuck this. 

Tayler jams the phone in her pocket and lunges up from bed, pacing towards the opposite corner of the room. Spinning to face the space&#39;s whole, she can spy all of her belongings. Shelves of books and games she hasn&#39;t thought of for months and posters lining the walls like taunts of escapist daydreams which can never be. She knows that, under it all, is where the occultism is hidden -- sigil sketches, magic sent by friends, resources for no longer being human. All crimes against a normal world.

All evidence.

She grabs her bookbag, dumping the contents. Mom left early for whatever, having bounced without leaving a single note, and dad&#39;s been out. No phone calls about their child skipping are going to arrive until long after Tayler&#39;s done here.  

Maybe her phone is evidence, too, she thinks to herself as she shoves her laptop from her desk into the bag.

Midday is burnt. Smoke blotches the forest canopy and blue sky, the sunlight somehow turning it into a infected orange with its intersecting glare. This isn&#39;t the mystic smoke of the rite -- this is the smoke of simple, raw obliteration.

Around Tayler is an abandoned camping ground, a retreat made in the middle of New York&#39;s nowhere for a flimsy sense of extra-suburban adventure. She doesn&#39;t care what the specifics of its death were; all that matters is that it still has campfire pits she can use.

Ruffling through her bag, she tears out the contents and tosses them without a glance. They drift, skirting over the pit&#39;s metallic rim, and are licked by the flames, dragged down to where the warmth can shred and disintegrate the whole. None of the items are volatile enough to have a potent magical backlash. It carries the same weight as burning unmarked sheets of paper. Nothing here will leave a sign of a presence now missing, nor will it leave a sign of a history now lost; only a mound of nondescript gray.

Having reached the final pieces of evidence to destroy, Tayler grabs a slip of tea-blotched cardboard. Right as she prepares to flick her hand she tenses, leaving her grip intact. The side she stares at is blank. She turns it over.

It&#39;s a present from Vesta, one they made in collaboration with Nova, and Lilith, and Grace, and Cady, and... Everyone she knows, really. There isn&#39;t any fanciness to it. Once you expose the rainbow-holographic runes -- cut from enough Pokémon cards to make a collector cry -- to moonlight it projects prismatic lights, glows of pride flags and the words &#34;your gay.&#34; Scratched in pencil on the bottom-left corner by Lilith is a quick life motto:

&gt; = //~ ~ do the __crimes__ of ur __dreams__ ~ ~//

An elementary school &#34;good work&#34; sticker stamps it.

Thinking of it, Tayler realizes she doesn&#39;t even know how they got the present to her. The question never came up; everyone was getting too into pride month celebrations to care. May be worth asking, considering how much effort it must&#39;ve taken to move the card around. How much effort--

She looks away as she tosses it in.

At the very bottom are the two hardest pieces to get rid of: the laptop and the phone. Phone she could drop in the fire right now and get rid of but...

= Not yet.

She doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s inside the battery. Setting unknown chemicals alight could turn this bonfire a lot less obscure than she&#39;d hope.

The smoke forms a smudge through the air, marred and jarring. The wind, as biting as ever, smears it out in a streak spanning far past Tayler&#39;s vision. From her vantage, lying on this precise patch of ground, she&#39;ll be the only person in existence to witness this exact image.

It&#39;s not one worth remembering, that&#39;s for sure. She stands up and hoists her bag over her shoulder.

The way home is a path of trees bare to the bone. At this time of day school remains far from ending, so no one who could recognize Tayler is around as she walks the streets. A full three hours until dismissal is the safety buffer encompassing the several minutes left of walking down her block. Her eyes are squarely on the pavement, the one realm of this town which feels truly natural to focus on. The cracks in it are certainly more interesting than those anywhere else.

She sighs a long, exasperated sigh. Everything about this sucked. The evidence is disposed of, but a parental wrath is still ensured. When mom gets home it&#39;s inevitable for there to be a one-sided shouting match, maybe a &#34;punishment&#34; in the form of revoking the use of something Tayler never uses, like the living room TV or her allowance, followed with some extra shouts to grind the point in. Tayler can tune it out as always. Simply taking it as it comes works best for these situations.

Perhaps she&#39;ll go more extreme, though that seems unlikely. Even in the worst case scenario, there is likely the whole afternoon to mentally reset before mom begins to consider returning. That&#39;s also an afternoon she can spend--

On the right-most side is a hallway extending further right, leading to a working space, generally unused, and the backdoor entrance, generally unused.

&gt; **##2897ff|tabris:##** i joined after she had died.
&gt; **##2897ff|tabris:##** i only hear of her from others.
&gt; **##d7d350|hybridRainbow:##** I joined at the tail end
&gt; **##d7d350|hybridRainbow:##** a few months before she
&gt; **##d7d350|hybridRainbow:##** before she did it
&gt; **##d7d350|hybridRainbow:##** I was never in the transfem channel she was in because thats not who I am but
&gt; **##d7d350|hybridRainbow:##** sometimes we&#39;d get the chance to talk
&gt; **##d7d350|hybridRainbow:##** did u know how easy it was for her to fake a smile
&gt; **##d7d350|hybridRainbow:##** she would always be working at planned parenthood clinics and she said she never had any trouble being outwardly cheerful while handling other people
&gt; **##d7d350|hybridRainbow:##** or her parents
&gt; **##d7d350|hybridRainbow:##** she said it came instinctively to her, like she was meant to have a persona to keep people at ease with
&gt; **##d7d350|hybridRainbow:##**  because it&#39;d help her better with work
&gt; **##d7d350|hybridRainbow:##**  I wish I couldve given her any advice or reassurance so maybe she could still be here but. I cant blame myself for that. I cant expect my past self to be the perfect therapist. that wasnt who I am.

//Thursday.//

//Midnight.//

//Nova&#39;s chassis gleams under the celestial spotlight. The moon reflects thousands of times between every fold of metal, shimmers at countless angles off the edge of every string and key.//

//Her presence is a commandeering force, one which demands the audience of the moon-set stage she treads upon. She is the show&#39;s sole performer and sole conductor. Her baton is not one of material, but one of self, forming her whole and resonating from her surface in an symphonic nebula of ethereal spectacle. Reaching for its instruments, the world plays along.//

//Vesta isn&#39;t here. What&#39;s here is a song of their own composition: a page of notes written like holes punctured through sheet paper. Chords stride across the plains, glance upon the edges, slip in, descend from music&#39;s presence into music&#39;s absence. It&#39;s a piece of negative-one-and-further-naught harmony assembled for absolute aural negation.//

//Nova has no trouble playing it. It&#39;s like she was meant for this moment her entire life.//

//Tayler throws her house&#39;s door open. The frame collides against the wall with a thunder the song completely mutes with its embrace. She can&#39;t hear her own breath as it burns through her lungs. The wind slams into her face and stabs her skin; she can&#39;t hear it, either. The cold is a dagger to her bones but a sudden warmth sweeps it back -- through the non-melodies Nova smiles at her.//

//She takes a look back at the building. On the upper floor is her dad, deep asleep, unprepared to find a room devoid of a son when morning comes. None of the lights are on. From the outside, the building is as cold and dead as the Earth she stands upon.//

//She&#39;s fine with letting it stay this way.//

//Clutching the straps of her bookbag tight to her chest, Tayler runs.//
