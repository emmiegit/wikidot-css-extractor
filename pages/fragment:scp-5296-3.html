**Item #:** SCP-5296

**Object Class:** Dependent[[footnote]] Dependent anomalies are those whom the Ethics Committee has found to be legally dependent on the Foundation. They are considered Safe to contain, but due to the Ethics Committee ruling, the Foundation is considered to have a moral obligation to sustain them. [[/footnote]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** Per ruling of the Ethics Committee, a veil is to be maintained regarding SCP-5296 so long as it instills genuine belief of SCP-5296&#39;s existence. Personnel with lower security clearance have been provided with a file detailing a false description of SCP-5296 in an effort to reduce any further potential conflict.

In accordance with the ruling made by the Ethics Committee on 25/09/2027, the Foundation is to make no attempts to harm SCP-5296. 

If any concerns are raised regarding the fake description of SCP-5296, they are to be dismissed and, if repeatedly brought forward, to be reported to Site Command who will decide how to proceed.

The only known instance of SCP-5296 (designated SCP-5296-α) is currently in Foundation custody.

**Description:** SCP-5296 is a disembodied, semi-physical humanoid whose existence appears to be tied to the genuine belief of said existence by human observers. Belief in crude images or misrepresentations of SCP-5296 is also sufficient for it to exist. Any genuine belief in its existence is effectively &#34;made true.”

It is currently unknown if SCP-5296-α is the only instance “in existence”; however, there have been several unverified reports by staff of the appearance of other instances.

Humans who perceive instances of SCP-5296 remain inconsistent in their observations, however a larger degree of coherence has been achieved in recent tests involving SCP-5296-α. 

**Addendum-5296-A**
On 25/06/2027, the Ethics Committee held a meeting to decide how to advise Site-11 staff regarding Senior Researcher Aster&#39;s findings about the potential that SCP-5296 relies on humans to exist. 

The following is an extract of the Ethics Committee&#39;s discussion (as taken from the logs of the meeting) on SCP-5296, as well as the statement that was sent to Site Command:

[[collapsible show=&#34;+Log-5296-01&#34; hide=&#34;-Log-5296-01&#34;]]
&gt; **Mathiesson:** If we consider the likelihood of Aster&#39;s theory to be anymore than, say, 10%, then surely we should be allocating resources elsewhere? Especially when there are very real anomalies that pose a significant threat, this seems the only reasonable response to me.
&gt; 
&gt; **Jones:** My problem with this is the possibility that SCP-5296 is sapient. If it is, then surely we have moral obligations to it, the same as to other humans. Isn&#39;t that the basis of our morality, that we assume the sapience of others and therefore have obligations to them?
&gt; 
&gt; **Lee:** Hold on a second, aren&#39;t we getting ahead of ourselves? We still have very little evidence that SCP-5296 even exists. Isn&#39;t it rash to make any assumptions based on its existence?
&gt; 
&gt; **Adams:** Unfortunately, we just have to work with the information we have. Because of this, we need to just accept what we&#39;ve been told. I&#39;d agree that this idea of sapience is very important to our ruling. Our next step should probably be to rule on some basic rights for the anomaly.
&gt; 
&gt; **Mathiesson:** I&#39;d agree with that, but our current information suggests that if that were the case, we would need to release information about SCP-5296 for it to continue existing. That could result in further conflict or even a breach of secrecy regarding SCP-5296.
&gt; 
&gt; **Adams:** It would be possible, given further testing, to experiment with a veil regarding SCP-5296, either for Foundation personnel or the public. This way we can avoid any further discord regarding SCP-5296. Given this, we could also dedicate minimal resources to SCP-5296 so as not to detract from other missions.
&gt;  
&gt; **Lee:** I would agree with you there. But ultimately, I&#39;m just unsure of if that matters when we don&#39;t know that this SCP even exists.
&gt; 
&gt; **Chair:** Ok, I&#39;d like to call the open discussion to a close as we move to vote on any proposed courses of action regarding SCP-5296.
&gt; 
&gt; **...**
&gt; 
&gt; **...**
&gt; 
&gt; **Chair:** Now to Adams&#39; proposal that we establish a veil regarding SCP-5296. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Chair:** Please cast your votes now.
&gt; 
&gt; **...**
&gt; 
&gt; **...**
&gt; 
&gt; **Chair:** Then if there are no more proposals, I shall announce that Adams&#39; proposal was the most agreeable with 64% of votes cast in content with it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Chair:** This meeting is now adjourned.

++++ NOTICE TO SITE COMMAND AND PERSONNEL ASSIGNED TO SCP-5296

Per recent Ethics Committee ruling and subsequent testing of SCP-5296, all personnel who are currently, or were in past, assigned to SCP-5296 are to report to B5-24 for a briefing regarding changes to containment. Site Command is to read over and implement the changes proposed in the attached document.

-- ██████ Mathiesson, The Ethics Committee

**Addendum-5296-B**
&gt; So we still don&#39;t really know much about SCP-5296. In fact, we&#39;re still unsure if it even exists, never mind this whole question of its sapience.
&gt; 
&gt; But the Ethics Committee were quite clear in their judgement: while we acknowledge the likelihood the SCP-5296 doesn&#39;t exist, we must treat them with the respect and care we would expect in their position, just in case they do.
&gt; 
&gt; And not doing so would be an unbelievable **mistake.**
&gt; 
&gt; Senior Researcher Aster</textarea></pre>
