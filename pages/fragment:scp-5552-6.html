    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-5552

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Research is to continue into the stabilization of SCP-5552 affected particles. 

**Description:** SCP-5552 refers to the Order of a particle. Order is a measurement of how well the position, velocity and rotation of a particle can be predicted given the state of the universe at the time of the Big Bang. Since the state of any individual particle is influenced by its collisions with nearby particles, the introduction of low Order particles will result in the lowering of the Order of the entire system. 

Macro-structures with Order below a certain threshhold will lose temporal stability. This lack of stability immediately result in a breaking and rearrangement of bonds between the particles to keep them anchored in their current position and trajectory along the temporal axis. This manifests in the creation of a black-powdery substance that occupies the same space as the structure at the time of stability loss, but will collapse into a liquid-like state upon disturbance. This transformation is termed &#34;wilting&#34;. 

**2018/04/16 Update:** I was going to pitch this to Cindy today, but apparently her whole neighborhood wilted last night. 46 houses, 166 casualties. The Foundation is trying to play it off as a fire.

I guess this means I&#39;m in charge of the CHRONUS Project again. Although I don&#39;t want to rush it. Not this time. I keep just diving back into the past but not this time. This time I&#39;m waiting until I know my theory works. But I think I can figure something out. There&#39;s something about this one that just feels... right.  

**2018/05/03 Update:** I&#39;m finally ready to start making the models. I tried running my theory by Dr. Green. He couldn&#39;t find anything immediately wrong, but then again he specializes in generalized reality-disturbances, so this isn&#39;t exactly his field. In fact, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anyone here who specialized in this field. Well, Cindy used to. 

Either way, I&#39;m ready to start putting together the models. If there&#39;s somewhere that my theories fall apart, it&#39;s here. 

**2018/06/18 Update:** The northern wing of Site-72 wilted today. Luckily none of my equipment was stored there, but they&#39;re moving everyone to Site-53 anyways. They gave me the same office as last time too. 

I&#39;m going to start building the BTTD now. I don&#39;t want to be screwed when this place also wilts. 

**2018/07/23 Update:** I haven&#39;t made any progress. Fucking nothing. This modeling software Cindy used is so damn confusing. Every time I get past one error message it throws another at me. Or I learn that I had the equations wrong. 

**2018/09/02 Update:** I&#39;d been thinking about this for a while and... I don&#39;t know why I haven&#39;t wilted yet. In fact I don&#39;t know how I don&#39;t wilt the moment I activate the time machine. Everything around me seems to collapse but I&#39;m fine. Why am I fine? I shouldn&#39;t be fine.

Maybe the models will give me some insight. I got Dr. Green to help me make the model run. Now all I have to do is play with the parameters until I get a lock on what makes this theory tick. 

**2018/09/26 Update:** I don&#39;t know how Cindy ever did this. There&#39;s so many constants. So many variables to tune. I&#39;ve looked back at her notes and they make no sense. She eliminates so many possibilities so quickly. Like there&#39;s some sort of an art to this that I can never grasp or understand. She was so good at this. 

**2018/10/08 Update:** I think I know why I&#39;m stable... there&#39;s only been one variable changing between each iteration. It&#39;s me. Which would imply that I should be the one wilting. I should be the one crumbling, destablilizing, collapsing into a puddle of particles. But, what if my order from previous jumps carries over? What if I&#39;m being held together by the order from my original timeline?

But then if everything in any given timeline should have stable order, and I have stable order then... the wilting must be coming from me. I&#39;m destabilizing the timeline here. Which is dumb now that I write it out. Of course it was all me. Of course this is all my fault. Of course I&#39;m the reason Cindy turns into a pile of fucking ashes every time I try to fix everything. 

**2018/12/01 Update:** Screw it. I can&#39;t get the models to work. They finished the BTTD yesterday so I&#39;m going back in time and getting Cindy to do it. Then we&#39;ll be able to fix everything. I just need her help.
