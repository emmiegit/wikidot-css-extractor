Welcome back to Parawatch Monthly Discussion. For those unfamiliar with the concept, every month the Parawatch Staff Team goes looking for posts, threads and comments that we find to be strong evidence of the supernatural and proof that the otherworldy exists. Whether you accept the truth that they are putting forward or simply enjoy them as narratives, we hope to shed light on some of the most interesting and chilling stories that the site has to offer.

This month&#39;s theme is: **True Crime**.

For this month&#39;s discussion, I took the time to sit down with one of the site&#39;s best users, the wonderful ##f99|**crewtime**##. ##f99|**crewtime**## has been a member of the community since the earliest days of the forum, going back all the way to the late 90&#39;s. Since then, he&#39;s been returning to us to break down the most confusing and paranormal unsolved true crime cases. I&#39;ll let him speak about the topic and why he finds it interesting.

[[div class=&#34;parapost&#34;]]
I&#39;ve always been fascinated with the true crime genre, but only ever really the unsolved cases. When we know what happened, it just loses the interest for me. The Zodiac Killer fascinates me. What happened there? Dahmer doesn&#39;t. When the details are known, it stops being about trying to uncover the truth and just becomes dwelling upon evil.

Plenty of ink has been spilled over the years about unsolved mysteries, but very little of the time is attention given to cases which have a possible supernatural explanation. The ones that defy all logic and science. These are the cases that will never be solved, and many have a tendency to give up on them, but not me.

I first got into the genre with the [[[SCP-6455|ERD/LAM]]] case, who is apparently the most prolific serial killer in American history -- or a long-line of copycat killers or a coordinated group effort. One of those copycats was caught but couldn&#39;t have been responsible for all the cases attributed to him. My personal theory is that there was an original killer and his ghost possesses people, making them kill as he once did.

But ultimately, what really matters is figuring it out. We&#39;ll never stop the deaths until we do. And the same goes with all of the cases that we cover. Take Morris Mantell Murders, for example -- his wife and children butchered, but he apparently wasn&#39;t home at the time. Nobody entered the house, but security footage has a shadow on the walls, one that doesn&#39;t have an apparent real origin. Could it be that a shadowperson killed his family? Could another shadowperson kill a different family? Has it happened before?

Not every case I look into has a supernatural explanation. The vast majority don&#39;t. That&#39;s why my cases are uncommon: I really try to vet them to make sure &#34;Yes, this could be supernatural.&#34; and then present the facts of the case without speculation of my own. I don&#39;t want to bring forth my (many, many) theories about each case and what could have happened, just the simple facts, summed up and presented for thought.

I doubt we&#39;ll ever know what happened in the majority of these cases. Most of them are long thought cold. But maybe with all this evidence, we&#39;ll figure something out.

This month&#39;s chosen threads for discussion include:

[[div class=&#34;parapost&#34;]]
++ **[[[death-of-aj-fader|The Death of AJ Fader]]]**
 
Someone -- or very possibly a //something// -- chased AJ Fader and four of their friends across the Pacific Northwest for four days, before AJ Fader wound up dead. The four friends have never been seen again. What did they see?
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;parapost&#34;]]
++ **[[[vanishing-of-nils|The Vanishing of Nils Andreassen]]]**
 
An Oslo college student goes out drinking in a bar crawl and winds up dead in Jokkmokk Sweden three days later. Nobody saw him in the intervening time. How did he get there? What was he doing for those three days?
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;parapost&#34;]]
++ **[[[who-killed-silas-emerson|Who Killed Silas Emerson?]]]**
 
A member of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency leaves his work and spends the next two days running around Washington DC, refusing to talk to anyone, before his head is cut off and replaced with a pumpkin. Did he know what was coming for him? What&#39;s with the pumpkin?
[[/div]]

[[div class=&#34;parapost&#34;]]
++ **[[[bigfoot-did-it|Bigfoot Did It!]]]**

A young couple goes camping and hunting for Bigfoot. The lady is beaten to death -- her boyfriend obviously did it, but he tells the courts that the Bigfoot he had been hunting is responsible. Is there any truth to his claims, or is it just another weak alibi?
[[/div]]


[[div class=&#34;parapost&#34;]]
++ **[[[Flight 4145]]]**
 
Two men board an airplane. About thirty people make it off. The rest? Vanish into thin air. What was their motive? Where did the plane go? Did it crash somewhere in the wilderness, or is there a genuinely supernatural explanation? And what is the deal with that strange metal cylinder?

[[div class=&#34;parapost&#34;]]
++ **[[[The Boltmann Ambush]]]**

A family flees to the Pacific Northwest from an unseen pursuer. What occurred in their isolated cabin remains a mystery, but the four emaciated bodies carted out a week later are indisputable fact. The facts don&#39;t quite add up -- how did they starve surrounded by food? Why didn&#39;t they call for help? And the biggest question: what was lying in wait for them in Oregon before they ever get on the plane?

[[div class=&#34;parapost&#34;]]

++ **[[[impossible-murder|An Impossible Murder]]]**

A seemingly open and shut case -- a man walks in to a police station and confesses to a murder. However, the case rapidly begins to unravel and it is anyone&#39;s guess what the hell happened here.

[[/div]]

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Additional Information&#34; hide=&#34;- Out of Universe Explanation&#34;]]
[[div class=&#34;fourth-wall&#34;]]
This is an anthology Parawatch series about True Crime and unsolved mysteries. Each post in the series takes the form of a post by **crewtime**, who breaks down a different true crime case each time. crewtime does not have any personal involvement to the cases, simply working back from newspaper articles, journalism and first-hand sources about each case to present a detailed summary of the information and potential paranormal occurrences.

Inspiration for this series comes from a number of places, but some of the largest are posts on r/UnresolvedMysteries on reddit, Buzzfeed Unsolved (both the Supernatural and True Crime series) and the Unsolved Mysteries television show (again, both the supernatural and cold case episodes). Cases are generally cold cases, although there are some exceptions to that rule.

The series is open, but not in the same way as a canon is on the wiki. If you contact me with another story, I&#39;d be happy to include it, but it has to follow the general outlines of the rest of the series, in both subject matter and presentation.

Some basic rules/guidelines:
* Posts are narrated by **crewtime**, who doesn&#39;t have personal involvement in the case.
* Each post is a different fictional true crime case, typically featuring a death or disappearance, where a supernatural element has gotten involved. Often this element means the case won&#39;t be solved.
* Each case has an intended explanation, but these are rarely explicitly stated in the articles themselves (because crewtime wasn&#39;t there and only has second-hand information).
* Articles are normally just from crewtime, without any other Parawatch members replying to him.
