**Item #:** SCP-1481

**Object Class:** Safe 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1481 is to be kept in a securely locked safe on the second floor of Site-██. Site security is to remain on standby in proximity to tests conducted on SCP-1481.
 
**Description:** SCP-1481 is a plastic recyclable coffee cup.  SCP-1481 rests in an inactive state until it is physically rubbed by a sapient being. When SCP-1481 is rubbed, it will enter its active phase, in which it manifests a spectral humanoid hereby referred to as SCP-1481-1. SCP-1481-1 manifests dressed in multiple coats and torn jeans, all of which are likewise spectral but seem to nonetheless be stained with a variety of unknown substances. SCP-1481-1 has a nervous tic, which occurs every few minutes. 

Once SCP-1481-1 has manifested, it will offer to grant an unlimited number of &#34;wishes&#34; to the individual who caused it to manifest; however, SCP-1481-1 is largely non-compliant with said wishes, and will often ignore them, wrongly claim to have already fulfilled them, or produce an outcome which bears only a slight resemblance to the one requested.

SCP-1481-1 has made a variety of requests, which are typically for alcohol, recreational drugs, money, or warm food. 

**Addendum:** Tests were conducted by Doctor ████. The goal of the tests was to establish a general knowledge of the capabilities of SCP-1481-1. 

**Log of tests with SCP-1481:**

&gt; **Item Requested:** One sandwich
&gt; **Result:** SCP-1481-1 manifested a sandwich, which it promptly ate.
&gt; 
&gt; **Item Requested:** A winning lottery ticket
&gt; **Result:** SCP-1481-1 manifested a losing lottery ticket.
&gt; 
&gt; **Item Requested:** A 100-carat diamond.
&gt; **Result:** 100 g of coal; SCP-1481-1 assured personnel that the coal was pure diamond.
&gt; 
&gt; **Item Requested:** &#34;The meaning of life&#34;
&gt; **Result:** SCP-1481-1 laughed hysterically for three minutes and fourteen seconds, then claimed to have forgotten what had just been requested. Subsequent requests for this item produced the same result.
&gt; 
&gt; **Item Requested:** The means to achieve unlimited energy.
&gt; **Result:** SCP-1481-1 manifested one deviled egg, which it promptly ate.


**Interview log 1481-1-2**
&gt; **Doctor ████:** Hello, SCP-1481-1.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1481-1:** Hey there, young feller!
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor ████:** SCP-1481-1, I have some questions for you. 
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-1481-1 stares at the South wall of the interview chamber for six minutes and nine seconds before answering.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1481-1:** You ever notice how, how //white// this wall is? I f-f-feel like it&#39;s got so much //meaning//.
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor ████:** In relation to the items you are able to manifest, where do you take said items from?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1481-1:** I, I know a g-g-guy who, who, a guy who knows a guy. Y&#39;know?
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor ████:** How--
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-1481 interrupts Doctor ████//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1481-1:** Enough damn questions! Man, I just need a taste. Just a taste! You can’t just order me to tell you stuff! If you get me, like, I dunno... say, thirty, forty grams of the, of the, of the  good stuff or s-s-s-s-something? C&#39;mon, man, please?
&gt; 
&gt;  //SCP-1481-1 was provided with 40 grams of methamphetamine, which it promptly consumed. Upon consuming the methamphetamine, SCP-1481-1 began to speak, and continued speaking for five hours and twenty-three minutes. Much of what SCP-1481-1 said during this time was incomprehensible &#39;word salad&#39; interspersed with profanity, and a large quantity of what are assumed to have been logorrheic neologisms. A full transcript of this &#39;word salad&#39; is available in Document 1481-RL51. One particular passage has been retained in this report, as it may provide clues to the origin of SCP-1481-1//
&gt; 
&gt; __Excerpt of speech from SCP-1481-1__
&gt; 
&gt; -- so there I, I, there I was, right in f-f-f-front of this guy, waiting for him to make his, his fuckin&#39; wishes an&#39;, an&#39;, an&#39;, he looks at me an&#39; he says &#39;for my f-f-f-first wish, I, I, I,... for my...&#39; He says... he... he fuckin&#39; wishes for me to be a fuckin&#39; alcoholic j-j-j-junkie tweaker crackhead! An&#39; then he says that his, his second, his second wish is that the, the, the first wish couldn&#39;t, couldn&#39;t be unwished. An&#39; then he just walks off! I don’t, I, I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t understand it. I really don&#39;t. So now I&#39;m, I&#39;m, my life is, my whole fucking life is r-r-r-ruined. I used to give k-k-kings whatever they wanted, you know? I used to live in, in palaces. Now I got no f-f-f-friends, just the cold nights and the hard ground and nowhere to lay my head down and I --
 

**Interview log 1481-1-7** 

&gt; **Doctor ████:** SCP-1481-1, I was wondering --
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1481-1:** Yeah?
&gt; 
&gt; **Doctor ████:** If you have these powers, why don&#39;t you just manifest the drugs yourself, like you do with the food?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-1481-1 begins weeping; weeping continues for 17 minutes 41 seconds, at the end of which it demanifests and re-enters SCP-1481.//


No further testing of SCP-1481 has been authorized.
