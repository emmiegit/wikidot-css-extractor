++ ##850005| **{{FOREWORD:}}**##
War has changed. No longer do we fight with sword and shield; the Insurgency is now armed with the means to render entire cities inhospitable from afar. We of Delta Command understand that the first step in winning the war against the anomalous is amassing an anomalous arsenal of our own. This is irrefutable fact written in blood and sacrifice. However, we are losing the arms race. The paratechnological prowess of the Coalition and the many monsters and artifacts held under the Foundation&#39;s reins have rendered us obsolete against our foes.

It has been discovered that there exists a means of striking the Overseers where they least expect. Armed with the new Red Right Hand of the Free World, and with our crosshairs aimed at the head of the universe, we shall turn the tides of battle with only a single shot. Let our shot heard round the world ring.

//Hereafter we of Delta Command document the Steps of the Plan as transcribed by the Engineer of the Chaos Insurgency.//

------

++ ##850005| **{{1. STEP 63/001}}**##
The Asset is located at Foundation Area-28 in Egypt. It shall be airlifted to Site-108 soon. Given the impressive level of security at the facility, raiding it at the current moment is suicide, so retrieving it while in transit is our only opportunity.

Dispatch a team of twelve Alpha-class personnel led by two Beta-class personnel to hijack the plane mid-flight and retrieve the Asset using a separate plane. Instruct the Betas to employ the &#34;Faraday Device&#34; to jam all outbound communication from the plane. Instruct the Alphas to leave no survivors in the wreckage.

++ ##850005| **{{2. STEP 63/014}}**##
Gamma-class operative &#34;WHIPLASH&#34; is to deliver an initial report of the newly-retrieved Asset to Delta Command.

##850005|**{{Author:}}**## Agent &#34;WHIPLASH&#34;

##850005|**{{Item Report:}}**## The Asset is a weathered Dragunov sniper rifle, chambered in 7.62×54mmR. Its wooden stock seems to be engraved with a variety of hypnotic symbols which we currently cannot decipher. Mounted is a seemingly ordinary PSO-1 telescopic sight. Initial examination of the scope itself suggests that it is non-functional, showing nothing to a viewer as if it were being blocked by an object. When aimed at a living creature, however, a magnified and glowing silhouette of the target shall appear within the scope.

When fired, the target will be struck in a lethal location, so long as the weapon is used within its effective range of 800 meters. The round seems to alter its trajectory on its own accord in order to guarantee a lethal hit and to strike however many victims were within the sight picture when firing. The round is similarly capable of anomalously adjusting its trajectory in order to bypass (or defeat) any cover a target may be protected behind. The anomalous properties of the scope described before means that concealment is similarly out of the picture for any targets. The audible effect of this phenomenon gives the impression that one is being fired upon from a different location than the shooter.

Disassembling the scope or rifle reveals no anomalous technology involved in the construction of either, but renders the scope totally inoperable if separated from the rifle. Similarly, attaching the scope to any comparable AK-47-like rifle will also render the scope inoperable. The rifle itself is otherwise non-anomalous and fully functional so long as it is maintained properly, even with the scope removed. The reasoning for this connection is currently unclear. I recommend keeping the scope on to maximize its utility.

The results from the most recent test of this anomaly have been most pleasing, but still more information is needed to ascertain its effectiveness as a practical tool for our operations. At the same time, I don&#39;t want to have to waste any of our vital Alpha-class personnel on the Asset like we would with expendable test subjects—we //aren&#39;t// the Foundation, of course.

The ongoing war in Vietnam and the disarray there should provide us with plenty of test subjects for our studies. Let&#39;s make use of this opportunity that Fate has presented us.

##850005|**{{Author:}}**## Dr. X. Richards

##850005|**{{Summary Report:}}**## Continued testing has confirmed the utmost lethality of the Asset, as a single shot is all that is needed to kill a target most of the time. At the request of Agent WHIPLASH, our gunsmiths have added a set of canted iron sights to the Asset, to be used in situations in which using the scope would be impractical, such as close quarters combat. This should prove to be greatly useful to our commandos in the field.

We are currently requesting additional time, funding, and expendable test subjects to continue testing with the Asset. Please understand that given its lethality and the readily available nature of ammunition, we go through people rather quickly here.

A caveat: Caution must be made in fielding this weapon to prevent unnecessary collateral casualties for obvious reasons. Several agents have also observed a slight compulsion to continue using the weapon on as many targets as possible, regardless of their allegiance, while the weapon is visible or slung.

I don&#39;t trust the compulsive nature of this. Keep this away from the Betas, and most definitely the Alphas. 

[[/div]]

++ ##850005| **{{5. STEP 64/029:}}**##
Insurgency R&amp;D Cell &#34;Gun Club&#34; demands more test subjects. Satiate their demands quickly, but find out why they need more.

++ ##850005| **{{6. STEP 64/030:}}**##
A drop-off has been made at Storage Base KL by one of our spies. A Beta-class researcher has analyzed the documents and reported his findings to Delta Command. In short, it appears this anomaly predates the Foundation, but even they had little information on the Asset; it simply seemed to appear in their possession one day.

While a noteworthy fact indeed, this will not help us maximize our efficiency in utilizing the Asset. Let&#39;s continue testing this as much as we can.

++ ##850005| **{{7. STEP 64/035:}}**##
Insurgency R&amp;D Cell “Gun Club” requested more test subjects again, this request was denied. Transfer the Asset to Insurgency Military Cell &#34;Headhunters&#34; instead. Give them ample time and expendable personnel to train with it. 

++ ##850005| **{{8. STEP 64/036:}}**##
The Shot Heard Round the World commences. The Headhunters know their mission.

Further testing of the Asset&#39;s capabilities as a practical tool are required. An opportunity to do so, whilst also shaking up the Foundation&#39;s leadership, has presented itself.

Your mission is to assassinate Foundation Site Director Simon Márkó of Site-108 using the Asset. Director Márkó is known to leave the facility to take a smoke break in the commons every day between the hours of 0700-0730, 1200-1230, and 1700-1730. Given the effective range of the Asset, missing would be impossible once he is in the open.

Any and all questions in regards to this operation are to be given to your Gamma-class commander. Burn this document upon receipt of your instructions.

Was assigned to supervise the Headhunters during Operation &#34;DECAPITATION.&#34; The mission was to eliminate an opposing group of thaumaturges, and while Beta-class Agent Whitehall //certainly// succeeded in that task, he suddenly turned the Asset on his comrades and opened fire. I am unsure as to how many civilians died in the crossfire from him aiming down the scope, though my guess is a couple dozen. Was unable to count the bodies. I believe he intended to kill me too, but ran out of ammunition, and simply fled with the Asset instead of finishing me off. Still in pursuit of the Asset, the Foundation was already on the scene along with local law enforcement, so I egressed from my position soon after Whitehall escaped.

Agent Whitehall is an extremely loyal member of the Chaos Insurgency whom I have worked with many times before, but something in the Asset compelled him to turn against his comrades. Dr. Richards is most definitely correct that there is some sort of compulsive nature to the Asset, and I do not trust it.

So long as he is with the Asset, and has an ample supply of ammunition, Agent Whitehall&#39;s murderous rampage will continue, and securing him will be exceedingly difficult. My best bet is to try a second chance at re-securing it from the Foundation, should they (likely) re-contain the anomaly.

Heard you troopies needed a magic sniper rifle back. I snooped around on Foundation comms for a bit, and now, I happen to know where it is, and I am ready to re-secure it on your command. As for how, I&#39;ve done the whole “re-securing” thing for most of my life back when I worked for the Foundation. As for why, that’s not really important, but gettin&#39; the documentation for this thing from the Skippers wasn&#39;t easy and //definitely// wasn&#39;t clean, so I want the Staff of Hermes[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]###000000|A tool in our Catalogue capable of altering the physical and chemical properties of any matter it touches, usually to a random degree.

//[Hudson&#39;s camera activates as he emerges from some shrubbery to survey the area before him through some binoculars. About a kilometer ahead is an abandoned-looking compound in the middle of some marshland. To his east, a small group of camouflaged MTF operatives can be seen tactically advancing upon the building, their figures partially concealed by the water and various brush in the marsh. They have their weapons drawn and aimed at the windows.]//

//[Hudson maintains his position and remains almost completely still, silently watching the Foundation advance on the building. After some time passes, the loud crack of a gun firing is suddenly heard, as one of the MTF agents suddenly goes down. Blood quickly begins filling the murky water around the body from an open wound in the soldier’s head. The rest of the operatives hasten their advance on the compound as another agent from the rear begins firing upon the windows with an M60 machine gun. Hudson uses the ongoing gunbattle to his advantage to begin moving towards the compound towards the west.]//

//[Upon reaching the westward façade of the building, Hudson equips the Staff of Hermes and presses it against the wall. A small segment of the wall begins to warp and compress, as if it were burning paper. This produces a sizable hole in the wall which allows Hudson to simply step through and enter the building. Already, he can see that the bodies of several MTF agents lie on the floor; one faces Hudson, clutching his neck, slumped against a wall with a long streak of blood behind him, while another lies dead in the hallway.]//

**HUDSON:** //[Whispering]// Hey, bru, &#39;fuck is he?

//[Blood is pouring from an open wound in the MTF operative&#39;s neck, and he only manages a weak gurgle. Multiple heavy thumps from a gun firing are heard on the floor above, but the M60 continues firing upon the building. After this, occurs, Hudson unslings an Uzi carbine from his webbing and quietly advances past the agent towards a flight of stairs going up.]//

**HUDSON:** Useless fuck.

//[Hudson pauses at the top of the stairwell, drops to a knee, and aims down his sights at a doorway facing the stairs. The semi-automatic gunfire inside the room continues as the automatic M60 fire from outside abruptly cuts out. This is followed by the sound of something hollow dropping to the floor.]//

**HUDSON:** //[Muttering]// He’s reloading. Now&#39;s my chance.

//[Hudson opens fire upon the door with his Uzi in a sweeping motion. A loud yelp can be heard inside of the room along with the sound of a body loudly dropping to the floor. Hudson suddenly stops firing, gets up, and quickly breaks into a sprint towards the hallway to the left, diving and rolling into another doorway. He begins shifting as far away from the now bullet-riddled door as possible. Three loud bangs are then heard from inside of the room, as bullet holes appear in the wall. The rounds being fired are tracer rounds which suddenly and sharply turn downwards and continue down the stairwell, striking the MTF operative still alive downstairs and killing him instantly.]//

//[Hudson immediately gets up and runs for the door. After shooting at the doorknob, he kicks the door open and quickly draws his sidearm with his free hand, clearing both halves of the room visually. Whitehall lays on the ground at the center of the room beneath a broken window, his body covered in bullet holes and blood. He is slowly writhing around on the floor.]//

**HUDSON:** Fuckin’ savage, you’re still not dead? Maybe the gun does something to your nerves that I don’t know. //[Scoffing]// Dunno. Either way, I’m here to take your gun, Whitehall.

**WHITEHALL:** //[Wheezing]// No… //[Gurgling]// ours...

//[Hudson lets his Uzi fall to his side on its sling as he switches his sidearm to his dominant hand, slowly advancing towards Whitehall while pointing his gun at the man. The Asset lies a few steps away from Whitehall, covered in some blood. As he approaches, Whitehall tries leaning up and grabbing the Asset, but Hudson is quick to push it away with his foot.]//

**HUDSON:** Ah, ah! No, no no.

**WHITEHALL:** It was... //[Heavy breathing]// ...supposed to be ours. 

**HUDSON:** Mine now. 

//[Hudson picks up the Asset and removes the magazine, racking the charging handle to release the chambered round. He slings the rifle against his shoulder.]//

**HUDSON:** Just one last question, before I put you out of your misery, okay?

//[Whitehall only breathes heavily, his chest rising and falling rapidly. Hudson gestures with a finger to the miniature camera that is currently recording on his chest. Whitehall stares at Hudson; his eyes are heavily bloodshot, and his pupils are contracted heavily.]//

**HUDSON:** Why’d you do it, Whitehall? You were doing so well, Delta had their eyes on you for the newest Gamma, too, from what I can tell. Come on, fess up now, man.

**WHITEHALL:** It was supposed to be ours, Hudson Croix.

//[Hudson scoffs loudly.]//

**HUDSON:** Who the //hell// is &#34;our&#34; supposed to be, man? In case you haven&#39;t realized, the Headhunters are dead, bru. You&#39;ve got no one but yourself.

//[Whitehall gestures to the Asset.]//

**WHITEHALL:** Ours. 

**HUDSON:** Oh, you can&#39;t be serious. Did you just marry that or something?

//[Whitehall is silent. Hudson crouches in front of Whitehall.]//

**HUDSON:** Besides, it&#39;s mine now. Come on, just say something for the record. 

//[A pause. Hudson obnoxiously racks the slide of his pistol and points it at Whitehall&#39;s face, as if urging him to speak.]//

**WHITEHALL:** The Asset and I are one... homogenous unit. We... we have integrated. Do you not understand, Hudson Croix? When we combine, it&#39;s... it&#39;s like we are one. It speaks to me. Our destiny was so, so close.

//[Hudson lowers his pistol from Whitehall&#39;s face, but still keeps it pointed at him.]//

**HUDSON:** I actually don&#39;t understand, but, please. Go on. Enlighten me.

**WHITEHALL:** This is the driver of history. Have you not realized it yet? With my hands I have begun revolutions, killed off tyrants and presidents. This... this power has no limit, it... it is...

//[Whitehall gestures to the Asset, which is still visible on Hudson&#39;s shoulder. Hudson takes a glance at the firearm, then steps back, out of reach.]//

**HUDSON:** Holy fuck. Get it through your thick skull already: you killed your pals with this thing. //Enough// with the fucking gun, for once. 

**WHITEHALL:** But this is the key to the Insurgency! A weapon which we can finally point at the head of the Universe and take control of our destiny! But we cannot understand its true nature yet. I need to protect it for now. I must get it to the Engineer. I need to...-

**HUDSON:** ...Wh-

//[Whitehall tries to stand up and reaches for the gun again but sits back down as Hudson simply throws the weapon out of the room, out of sight. He then scoffs, annoyed, as Whitehall collapses back down onto the floor, apparently out of strength.]//

**WHITEHALL:** Agh- hurts...! Wh-

**HUDSON:** Okay. Fucking hell. Get a grip on yourself, Whitehall, you know about my short temper—wait, what am I fucking saying. You&#39;re obsessed with this thing now. Do you even //know// how crazy you&#39;re sounding right now, man? Telling me about needing to get this to the fucking //Engineer//, telling me this is some fancy fucking trinket or whatnot? It&#39;s a magic gun. Do you know what I think of all that nonsense you just said to me?

//[Whitehall looks confused suddenly.]//

**WHITEHALL:** Wait... wh... H-Hudson? What the-

**HUDSON:** I don&#39;t care about it. I think you&#39;re out of line, and that gun isn&#39;t helping. You&#39;re being decommissioned, Whitehall.

**WHITEHALL:** Wait-

//[Hudson flicks the safety off his pistol, aims at Whitehall&#39;s forehead, and pulls the trigger.]//

##850005|**{{Summary Report:}}**## I don&#39;t know what else to tell you. It&#39;s just a gun, slightly scratched after I tossed it out the door and a little bloody, but nonetheless, a gun. I have it locked in the Staff of Hermes&#39;s case for now since it fits. Other than that, no changes have been made to the Asset.

Whatever is in this thing has very evil energy, so, for the love of God, please keep it locked up. //Don&#39;t// open it up once I give it to you, Command.

A handoff is to be made between Hudson and Delta Command a day from now. Secure the Asset and its Foundation documentation during the handoff. The Staff of Hermes can be recovered later.

##850005|**{{Summary Report:}}**## As of now, the Asset shall be sealed within its case inside of Storage Base KL. Any missions in which it is approved for use are to be cleared through us, regardless of whom the order comes from. It is to remain concealed when not in use. 

One burning question has stuck with me throughout my research: what is the history of the Asset? Where did it come from? The Foundation documentation we recovered suggests that it it seemed to have first emerged in North America in 1775, perhaps earlier, given the presence of documents belonging to the [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/unusual-cargo-hub The Commission on Unusual Cargo], dating it nearly 100 years prior. It took the form of a Brown Bess musket at the time, with similar qualities to the current rifle. It again appeared in 1914, just under a different appearance—a FN Model 1910 pistol this time. The only trait that has not changed are the strange, hypnotic patterns on it.

Only two questions remains: What is possessing it, and how did it become what it is now?
