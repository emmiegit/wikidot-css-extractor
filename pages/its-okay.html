i looked him in the eye
that dirtied man across the standing figures cut from pine
his smile i could not pry

not quite a scent of death
but wetted earth unbaked by hearth and worked in work-stained hands
pervaded every breath

his callus-coated palm
those steep demands upon his hands that craftsmanship commands
in desperate need of balm

say &#34;who am i to judge a man
by face or scent or scar-struck hand&#34;
and hark, say i, such was my plan:
i&#39;d come to find a storied man
and take from him, for price of gold
a chilling story to be told
through trinket, fetish, portend cold
and from such stories...

... look, poets need to eat, too. we can&#39;t all be artists for the sake of art.
(and lest this story fall apart):

upon his stand
(though carved by hand)
of rough-hewn pine unsmoothed by sand
like monsters from some hellish land
stood proud a demon-visage&#39;d band
of thieves and brutes and destitutes, a grand demand
you understand
how such foul things misunderstand
the faces, feel, and forms of man

and //surely// such features accursed
in them carried fortunes perversed

with hope their fates adjoin
upon my own, that i bemoan through poetry their woe
i offered up my coin

and so, wrapped all in twine
the darkest three (at least to me): a demon, crone, and czar
were taken in as mine

and so upon my desk
that beast bazaar&#39;s three beasts bizarre, my three-pronged guiding star,
leer down on me, grotesque

i go to sleep in shudd&#39;ring joy
exulting in my darkened ploy
that some unholy ghost or curse
may feed my future written verse

&gt; ...i dream of sheep.
&gt; they are not angry;
&gt; their do not bleat of my sins in unison;
&gt; their horns are no larger than what i might expect of sheep;
&gt; they are simply sheep.

the beasts that look upon my work
who leer and growl and darkly smirk
make no attempt/seem quite content
to lead me &#39;stray/I go my way
(or if they&#39;ve made their move
i&#39;ve not noticed)

&gt; ... i dream i&#39;m back at the academy.
&gt; i&#39;m late to class;
&gt; it&#39;s terrifying,
&gt; but i can&#39;t say i haven&#39;t dreamed such a thing before.

my next night,
pen alight,
greatness shines in all i write;
but scarcely can i think or see
three icons of grotesquery
play part or muse or daemon to
such lovey-dovey sap.

&gt; ... i don&#39;t even remember what i dream of.

so it turns out
those figurines?
they aren&#39;t actually cursed.
they just look funny.
fuck.

... although
if you ask me
&#34;do you regret your purchase, poet&#34;
&#34;has this ordeal proved fatiguing&#34;
let it be said that
curse or no curse,
the craftsmanship
was quite intriguing.</textarea></pre>
