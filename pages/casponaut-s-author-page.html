[[tab PERSONNEL DOSSIER]]
**NAME:** Roxanne C.

**SECURITY LEVEL:** Level-2 (probational)

**POSITION:** JUNIOR RESEARCHER

**LOCATION:** &#34;Fuck you.&#34; 

**PERSONAL HISTORY:** A student at ██████████ University, █████████████ - Researcher Roxanne C████████ was recruited by the Foundation after their experiences dealing with a localized anomalous incident incited by a fellow student (also recruited by the Foundation, see personnel file for Dr. H. West).

Roxanne C. specializes in anomalous culture, namely, those that arise on the internet. This, along with their age, has led to them being assigned to projects dealing with memetic anomalies as well as online religions and such.

While having an excellent track record with regards to work quality and experience in the field, Junior Researcher C. is held back by their attitude and lack of work ethic. Currently, they&#39;ve been put on probation regarding their Level 2 clearance regarding an incident involving several prominent anartists, including author ██████ ██████. This lack of work ethic and poor attitude is why they have not yet been promoted to full Researcher status.

+ PREVIOUS ASSIGNMENTS

Junior Researcher C. was assigned to the following SCP&#39;s as a leading researcher.

[[[SCP-4328]]]

They assisted in the development of the following documents and research materials.

[[[What if People Were Bees]]]

[[[And I&#39;d Let That Lonesome Whistle Blow My Blues Away... ]]]

[[tab ASSORTED NOTES (about me)]]

Howdy all! My name&#39;s Roxi (long story short I can&#39;t update my Wikidot name anymore so Casponaut is a name long since forgotten). I&#39;ve been writing on and off for the wiki for a few years now, and it&#39;s been such a giant influence in my life.

In terms of inspiration, that can change almost constantly. But if I have to say current inspirations, I&#39;d go with STALKER, Neuromancer, Snow Crash, and, well, the wiki itself.

I go by they/them pronouns at the moment!

Thanks for reading, and hope to catch ya on the flipside!
