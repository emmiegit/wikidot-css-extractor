= **Special Containment Procedures:**
----
Investigations into GOI-850 are ongoing and are headed by Project Labyrinth personnel.

Due to its extremely hazardous capabilities, SCP-3580 is not to be confronted by personnel. Attempts to capture it are to be conducted solely by specialized operatives. Unrelated or standard MTF units are not advised for deployment against SCP-3580. No less than two Nu-7 units are to be immediately dispatched for appearances of SCP-3580.

Disinformation campaigns have been initiated to conceal the nature of the Türkiye incident. Attempts at neutralizing or minimizing the ongoing conflict between Germany and Türkiye are underway.

Locating SCP-3580, as well as other members of GOI-850, has been deemed Priority Level ##orange|BETA##.

SCP-3580 denotes a feminine humanoid entity belonging to GOI-850 (&#34;Order of the Archine Eclipse&#34;)[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]##black|A secretive organization dedicated to collecting and harboring items of importance in anomalous history. All known members are highly dangerous and possess various anomalous traits.##[[/span]].

Physically, SCP-3580 is 190 cm in height with tied black hair reaching down to its waist. It is identifiable by its dark skin tone as well as its prosthetic arm augmentations.

While interactions with SCP-3580 have been scarce, it is known that it possesses incredible proficiency in close-quarters combat, specializing in the usage of edged weapons. It is also capable of moving and reacting at rapid speeds, with one instance displaying an estimated 65 km/h.

In addition, it has been found that SCP-3580 possesses an advanced degree of expertise in combat-related areas of thaumaturgy, utilizing these skills for primarily defensive purposes during observed conflicts.

It has been found through recovered correspondence that SCP-3580 is regarded as &#34;Inquisitor Proxima Ramexe&#34; among GOI-850 members.

----
SCP-3580-A is a humanoid entity, measuring roughly 400cm in height, belonging to GOI-850.

Physically, it has been observed to possess thick wrapping around its entire body with metallic plates placed around the shoulders, shins, thighs, forearms, back, neck, jaw, and head. Its left arm has been replaced by a mounted sextuple-barreled Gatling gun of an unknown model, with built-in ammunition reserves along its body.

SCP-3580-A has publicly identified itself as &#34;Cascade&#34;, and has demonstrated an advanced degree of intelligence.

SCP-3580, alongside SCP-3580-A, has engaged in multiple raids on Foundation sites, leading to various numbers of casualties while stealing artifacts and documents, or releasing persons of interest. Contact with other under-the-Veil agencies has reported few but several occasions of being attacked or approached by either SCP-3580 or SCP-3580-A.
----
= **Discovery:**
----
SCP-3580 was first observed on 18/2/1971 during a raid on Site-41 which resulted in the deaths of fourteen personnel. One person in this group was the Site Director, Malkin Fallen, who refused SCP-3580&#39;s demands for him to open multiple containment cells as MTF moved in.

When the incident concluded, several anomalous items were found to have been stolen, and an open terminal with level-3 submitted clearance entered was discovered. The terminal had been used to access all available topics relating to GOI-850, certain anomalies, and a brief attempt to uncover the location of Area-55 - the base of operations for GOI-850 investigations. This attempt was unsuccessful.

Near the end of the incident, multiple MTFs were deployed to Site-41, including Nu-7 (&#34;Hammer Down&#34;) and Epsilon 11 (&#34;Nine-Tailed Fox&#34;). However, they proved ineffective at stopping SCP-3580.

That same year, SCP-3580-A was first noticed during the failed detainment of POI-9112 [[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]##black|&#34;Kevin Gibson&#34;, an identified member of GOI-850. Wanted for human trafficking.##[[/span]]. During that incident, SCP-3580-A intervened, killing four MTF operatives and injuring the fifth before proceeding to terminate POI-9112.

Before it fled, SCP-3580-A interacted with the fifth agent - Agent Mortimer Woodlock. A transcript of the after-action report has been provided below.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
=  [[size 125%]]**Internal log - Woodlock and Riley dialogue**[[/size]]

//Agent Woodlock and Senior Researcher Jackie Riley are seated in an interview room.//

**Riley:** How&#39;re ya holding up, Morty?

**Woodlock:** I&#39;ve been better.

**Riley:** Mm. I&#39;m really, really sorry for what happened.

**Woodlock:** It&#39;s... part of the job. Come on, Jack, you brought me here for a sob story or what?

**Riley:** Right. We wanted to know the specifics of what went on, on the twenty-first. What went wrong, what was that thing, just what happened?

**Woodlock:** Well, it was all going smoothly. Got the bastard up in cuffs at his home. To be honest, for all he did, just being held in a cell didn&#39;t seem like justice to me.

**Riley:** What would have been justice, then?

**Woodlock:** //Careful what you wish for// played a bit in my mind after the fact.

**Riley:** Mm.

**Woodlock:** So we&#39;d just cuffed him up and we were just about to move out. Suddenly, Kamsky starts shouting in the back. Says &#34;Get down!&#34;. I don&#39;t think he was alive by the time he hit the deck.

**Woodlock:** Bullets start spraying everywhere. Kamsky went first, then Rodriguez, Allison, and the Captain. Was lucky I was behind cover in the kitchen, so I grab Gibson and pull him down with me. I was lucky I only got nicked.

**Riley:** I wouldn&#39;t say almost losing your leg was a &#34;nick&#34;.

**Woodlock:** Sure, Jack. You&#39;d know.

**Riley:** Sorry.

**Woodlock:** Now, as I was saying, I&#39;m holding this idiot and he&#39;s screaming bloody murder. Of course, I can barely hear him since I didn&#39;t have my hearing protection in, and the gun show just started about twenty feet away.

**Woodlock:** But even while Gibson&#39;s crying like a baby, I could feel something - a rumbling. There was a shadow on the wall, and it was coming towards us. I could barely move, so I crawl over to hide behind the kitchen counter. I try to drag Gibson with me, but I was too late. He gets picked up.

**Woodlock:** I look up and see this huge hulking thing standing there, hoisting Gibson by the neck. It&#39;s gigantic - has to get down on one knee just to fit in the room. Covered in black drapes and what looked like roughed-up armor. It had these, these glowing green eyes that pierced through the thing&#39;s mask. And a great big gun on one of its arms.

**Woodlock:** So it holds Gibson up and looks him in the eye. I can&#39;t hear what it says, and it looked like Gibson was just begging for his life. All I see after is a quick movement, shadows and shit, and a dust cloud falling from the wall. Gibson&#39;s brains are splattered everywhere, and his body falls backward from up on top the kitchen sink.

**Woodlock:** So I try to scoot away. I&#39;m losing a lot of blood, so I try to treat it at the same time. I&#39;m panicking - not thinking straight. It notices me, and I start shitting bricks.

**Woodlock:** It nudges over and looms over me. My ears start to clear, and I can hear it speaking.

**Riley:** What did it say?

**Woodlock:** I can&#39;t remember exactly what, but it did say something along the lines of an apology. I tried to raise my gun - big fucking mistake.

**Woodlock:** I take a shot at its face, it clocks me so hard in the arm the pistol goes flying and my hand feels twelve types of broken.

**Woodlock:** It stands up and glares down at me with those cold eyes. It stood there for a minute, just watching me fucking writhing before it pissed off. I pass out and get rescued like a princess.

**Riley:** I don&#39;t know what to say, Morty, I-

**Woodlock:** Like I said: It&#39;s part of the job. Always just a part of the job.

SCP-3580 then proceeded through the facility. It made its way to several lockdown bunkers, breaking into them and searching for a researcher with level-4 clearance.

----
GOI-850 is a highly secretive, loosely organized international religious group comprised of both standard and anomalous humanoids. Evidence of GOI-850&#39;s existence dates as far back as the 18th century, though it is believed that it has existed for far longer than that.

GOI-850 has been credited with the theft of multiple items of interest to anomalous history - an undefined amount of the past that has either been forgotten or hidden from the Foundation or the general public. Such items that have gone missing range widely in subjects, from enchanted weaponry of old to evidence of the Siege of the Hearth.

It is believed that GOI-850 operates outside of multiple unknown locations, having spread out across the Earth following a failed attempt at securing their original facility in the early 1800s. After this attempt, however, GOI-850 went into an elongated state of dormancy as the mission had, purportedly, heavily crippled their ranks.

GOI-850 is primarily maintained by an unknown number of enhanced humanoids - referred to as &#34;Knights&#34; - only one of which has been observed and contained by the Foundation, excluding SCP-3580 and SCP-3580-A. Analysis of this entity revealed a mixture of crude carnomantic[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]##black|Thaumaturgic manipulation of flesh and living matter.##[[/span]], technological, and thaumaturgical procedures had been performed on it, leading to its aforementioned augmentations.

The group is devoted to a figure known as &#34;Archine Primus&#34;, an ancient hero credited for having imprisoned multiple monsters, including a large bird-like beast that had been terrorizing a village.

Recently, however, with the identification of POI-9112, it has become known that GOI-850 engages in acts of slavery. Thus far, no person having gone missing as a victim of POI-9112 has resurfaced.

Further details on GOI-850 are scarce, unprovable, or unknown. Investigations are ongoing.

In light of recent events, multiple resources have been pooled into creating a temporary Mobile Task Force unit for combatting and containing SCP-3580. This group, managed by Captain Mortimer Woodlock, utilizes several kinds of prototypical anomalous weaponry selected for SCP-3580, as well as armor designed for resistance to slash and pierce-based attacks.

Currently, the team (Sigma-8 &#34;Hellbound Cavalry&#34;) is composed of seven operatives picked from multiple high-ranking units, and chosen for having experience in close-quarters combat. Given the threat displayed during Incident-3580-1 and Incident-3580-2, proposals have been made for agents under Sigma-8 to undergo augmentation, pending approval.

Multiple requests have been filed by Junior Researcher Fallen to participate in Sigma-8&#39;s activities, all of which have been denied.

**Woodlock:** I have a name, y&#39;know. What&#39;s up?

**Fallen:** I&#39;m here about that rejection.

**Woodlock:** Look, take it up with the dictator. I&#39;m not the one refusing your applications.

**Fallen:** Sir-

**Woodlock:** I kinda agree with &#39;em. Look, I know what you&#39;re playing here. You&#39;re angry, you&#39;re upset, but throwing yourself at a deranged lunatic ain&#39;t gonna bring your old man back.

**Fallen:** Well what else can I do to help?

**Woodlock:** Stick around, help your mother get through this. I imagine she&#39;s going through the same shit as you. She needs you.

Attached below is an interaction between Captain Woodlock and the assistant director of Area-55, Samuel McManus.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
=  [[size 125%]]**Internal log - Woodlock and Samuel dialogue**[[/size]]

//The two are talking as they walk through the upper facility of Area-55.//

**Samuel:** This place might as well be a fortress, especially now on lockdown. Increased security on standby, an MTF, yours excluded, on standby not far from here, several dozen levels full of architecture designed to handle rampaging anomalies, not to mention the big-bad re-containment specialist themself.

**Samuel:** We&#39;ve collected every piece on GOI-850 the site has and placed it all into a secure area on the lower floors. Personnel with clearance 4 have temporarily had their levels demoted to their lowest necessary access. Lockdown&#39;s a pain, but the safety of the site comes first.

//Woodlock nods along.//

**Samuel:** A team and I examined the recording of it fighting; while its technique is unorthodox, its most alarming facet, besides its swiftness, is its incredible strength.

**Woodlock:** No shit. It sliced through half a task force in one go!

**Samuel:** I watched the recording, same as you.

**Woodlock:** That thing has to answer for that. Twelve good men and women died for its sadistic pleasure.

**Samuel:** Which is why you&#39;re here in the first place. If you are approved for those augments, I&#39;d imagine taking it on would be made much simpler, though tracking it has proved fruitless. The only lead we found was an attack on the GOC, which reported a description similar to SCP-3580 over a year ago. Killed the entire strike force of four mercenaries before kidnapping their target -  some reality bender kid.

**Woodlock:** //Great//, so bupkis on where it is now?

**Samuel:** Unfortunately so. We&#39;re working as quickly as possible to find anything on it, but between the roadblocks we&#39;re already facing and the fact that the woman may as well be a ghost, we&#39;d be lucky to find a single somewhat worthwhile bead.

**Woodlock:** Shit.

**Samuel:** How&#39;s the team going? The director expressed their disapproval of this task force&#39;s creation, and I&#39;d like something to show to hold them over.

**Woodlock:** It&#39;s going about as well as it could be. Not many hiccups or problems. Hell, we even got a mage on the job.

**Samuel:** So you think they&#39;ll be ready to deploy and combat SCP-3580 should the need arise?

**Woodlock:** It&#39;s not about //should it// but //when will it//. It&#39;s a matter of time.

**Samuel:** The last time it surfaced, it disappeared for years.

**Woodlock:** Wouldn&#39;t be wise to depend on that. It disappeared because it screwed up. It couldn&#39;t get what it wanted so it hid from us, like last time.

**Woodlock:** That wasn&#39;t the last period of Order activity either, it was just the last time we saw their ace in action. They probably spent all this time trying to find another site to attack and how to properly get in and out.

**Woodlock:** We&#39;ll have to be ready, and I&#39;ll have to get us there.

Because of her potential information on GOI-850&#39;s affairs, an armored van transport carrying two agents of Sigma-8 was dispatched to secure and deliver her to Area-55 for questioning.

During POI-1492&#39;s transit, however, the van was intercepted by SCP-3580, who proceeded to kill all four Foundation personnel on board and capture POI-1492. Both targets managed to escape before additional forces could arrive.

Because of this, Sigma-8 has been cleared for the use of augmentations sourced from trusted anomalous vendors for combat. These augments will be voluntary to operatives and will be fully covered by the Foundation. These cybernetic additions will aim to enhance agents&#39; abilities during engagements, stimulating increased muscle capacity and speed.

Two of mine are dead, and two of yours are dead. Samuel, I told you that divvying the team up was the wrong move. Lockdown or not, this team was built on cooperation and combined strength, not taking on the black ninja one at a time.

Throwing more and more agents at this thing haphazardly isn&#39;t working. More people who are never going home won&#39;t solve anything. If you want 3580 in custody, then I need to be in control of this operation and how we go about bringing it down, not you. We can&#39;t afford another screw-up.  

Don&#39;t interfere with my end of this again.

**Security Clearance:** 3
**Employed As:** Junior Researcher / Field Agent
**Current Assignment:** Area-55 Engineering / SCP-3580

**Personnel Report:** Following the loss of his father, Site Director Malkin Fallen, during a containment breach, Mr. Fallen was offered a position with the Foundation after assessing his ability to adapt to the workforce and his sufficient talents and intelligence.

At first, he showed a level of maturity regarding the unfortunate incident and acclimated fairly well into the Foundation. However, shortly after the death of his civilian mother, Josephine Fallen, his demeanor took a rapid decline, both in his work and his social skills, and he took up a great interest in SCP-3580&#39;s case.

Presently, Mr. Fallen has submitted five separate requests to enlist in MTF Sigma-8&#39;s activities in the containment of SCP-3580. Upon the fifth attempt, the request was tentatively granted by Director Roufhous with a recommendation from Captain Mortimer Woodlock on the condition that Mr. Fallen would be closely monitored during training and engagements.

It then proceeded to make its way back through the facility, avoiding contact with all personnel along its way, and was eventually confronted by Captain Woodlock. Attached below is the recording of that incident.

//SCP-3580-A is charging down a hallway, continuously bursting through shutting doors and reinforced gates with some effort. It holds the artifact close to its chest as it runs.//

//As it breaks through another barrier, it is met with Captain Woodlock pointing his rifle at it.//

**Cpt. Woodlock:** Been a while.

**SCP-3580-A:** You, I remember you. I hope your recovery was swift.

**Cpt. Woodlock:** Not really. In fact, it was pretty slow and it was pretty painful.

**SCP-3580-A:** I see. My deepest apologies.

**Cpt. Woodlock:** I don&#39;t accept. Put it down.

**SCP-3580-A:** You&#39;re severely outgunned here, my friend.

//A shotgun is racked, and its barrel is tapped against the back of SCP-3580-A&#39;s head.//

**Dir. Roufhous:** Likewise.

**SCP-3580-A:** I see. How unfortunate.

**Cpt. Woodlock:** Yeah, I&#39;d say that&#39;s about right. Now-

//It brings its arm forward first and slams its elbow into Roufhous, sending them backward. Woodlock takes several shots at it, which do not appear to penetrate its armor.//

//It repositions to target Woodlock but is stopped as Roufhous stabs into SCP-3580-A&#39;s gun with their blade. It tries repeatedly to swat them off with its free hand to no avail. They level their shotgun at its chest and take several shots in quick succession. It is visibly hurt by this, and staggers.//

//It manages to unjam its gun, and brings it around to Woodlock.//

//Woodlock aims the rifle at its face and takes a shot.//

//The bullet pierces its frontal plating and it rears back, roaring.//

//Roufhous gets down behind it and fires at the back of its knees.//

//It falls on its back, cracking the linoleum floor beneath it, still clinging to the canister.//

//Woodlock runs over and places his full weight on SCP-3580-A&#39;s gun. Roufhous kneels down, placing the barrel of the shotgun directly atop its head. Woodlock reaches down, grasping his radio.//

**Cpt. Woodlock:** Boys, get down here, Sub-7, Hall-8, on the double!

**SCP-3580-A:** Greatly... unfortunate.

//It takes multiple deep breaths; the duration of these surpassing human capabilities.//

**SCP-3580-A:** However, there is, perhaps, one problem.

//Woodlock levels his rifle at its head.//

**Cpt. Woodlock:** Fuck you mean?

//It pauses, breathing heavily still.//

//It chuckles.//

**SCP-3580-A:** Did you forget? She&#39;s the wizard. She has with her some rather magical hands.

//Suddenly, a rift opens upon the ceiling, and a bloodstained SCP-3580 falls through. In its singular remaining prosthetic, it carries its sword.//

//As it falls, it kicks Woodlock sending him flying back, and stabs Roufhous in the torso, sending them to the floor. They drop the gun. SCP-3580 laughs wildly.//

**SCP-3580:** Just as pitiful as the rest!

//SCP-3580-A gets to its feet, struggling with its wounds.//

**SCP-3580-A:** Proxima, enough. It is finished.

**SCP-3580:** I don&#39;t answer to you, Grand Warden.

**SCP-3580-A:** More than enough blood has been shed. We can leave now. We must leave now before more arrive.

**SCP-3580:** We can kill them too. It&#39;s of little concern.

//SCP-3580-A stomps, cracking the floor beneath it with a loud crash.//

**SCP-3580-A:** Proxima, **enough**!

**Dir. Roufhous:** Oh, sure, you can kill them all if you resort to the lowliest of maneuvers, much like a child too afraid of serious confrontation.

//A sound echoes through their mask before SCP-3580 pulls its sword out. It takes the blade and strikes their mask, causing it to shatter and spill blood.//

**SCP-3580-A:** Inquisitor Ramexe, open the gateway so that we may leave this place.

**SCP-3580:** Fine!

//It stands and creates a thaumic symbol with two fingers in the air. It draws the incantation, creating an elaborate rune of golden sparkling light that expands to a diameter roughly two meters long, its interior depicting another location.//

**SCP-3580:** Satisfied, Warden?

**SCP-3580-A:** Come along now.

//It steps through the portal and stands on the other end, awaiting SCP-3580. SCP-3580 looks down at Roufhous.//

**SCP-3580:** Burn in Hell, //Venator//.

//Woodlock finally gets to his feet and aims his rifle at SCP-3580.//

**Cpt. Woodlock:** Hold it!

//It looks back and laughs.//

**SCP-3580:** We&#39;ve been through this many times already; bullets won&#39;t work, little agent.

//Woodlock pulls back the charging handle of the rifle.//

**Cpt. Woodlock:** Think you&#39;re good enough to keep up two spells at once? You wanna take that chance with just the one hand?

//SCP-3580 crouches down. It is silent for several seconds.//

//It looks down.//

**SCP-3580:** That child back there was cross with me, wasn&#39;t he? His father, he said the man was a manager of one of these branches.

**Cpt. Woodlock:** Site Director Malkin Fallen.

**SCP-3580:** That&#39;s the one. Director, funny. Funny what kinds of honors they bestow upon you honorless batches of men. Junior, senior, lead researcher. Operative, agent, commander, //captain//.

**Cpt. Woodlock:** Kill that portal-

//It grabs onto Roufhous and hurls their body towards Woodlock, who holds his fire as he is knocked down.//

//It dashes after the portal. Woodlock takes several wild shots at it, all miss. It makes it through and the portal closes right after.//

**Cpt. Woodlock:** Son of a bitch!

//He looks around. Director Roufhous has disappeared.//

The document stolen during this incident has been identified as half of an incantation capable of instantly transporting undefined amounts of matter from one location to another, at great expense to the caster. The remainder of this document beforehand remained unaccounted for.

The whereabouts of Site Director Roufhous are currently unknown. Assistant Director Samuel has assumed some of their duties over Area-55 in their absence.

Finding and containing SCP-3580 has been declared Priority Level ##red|ALPHA##. The classification of this situation as a crisis is pending.

On 12/3/1979, a search effort across all known anomalous channels began, attempting to locate SCP-3580. Since this time, no new activity has been noted for either entity, and their current location remains unknown. Retroactive investigations revealed several reports for both entities among other paranormal agencies, with accounts usually including violent depictions but lacked applicable information.

No throughline has been established with sightings of either anomaly, and few identifying details could be found. This venture is ongoing, and increased funds and resources have been allocated to this project; worldwide locating is ongoing, and the O5 Council has been alerted to this issue.

After the events of 11/3/1979, Agent Leonel Fallen was brought into intensive care and remained unconscious for a period of four days. He later awoke on the 15th and stabilized on the 20th. The operatives who died during that incident have been awarded Foundation Stars of Bravery, and their families have been notified and compensated.

//Agent Fallen is lying in a medical bed, Captain Woodlock at his side. Woodlock is looking down, stroking a photograph with his thumb. The image depicts the fully assembled Sigma-8.//

**Fallen:** Both of them. At once.

**Woodlock:** Right when we had her.

**Fallen:** Just as I was about to-

**Woodlock:** You were out of line.

**Fallen:** And if I did manage to do it?

**Woodlock:** Then you&#39;d be demoted.

**Fallen:** And the fat bastard wouldn&#39;t have escaped. Neither would she.

//Woodlock sighs, staring ahead blankly.//

**Fallen:** We had a chance.

**Woodlock:** We blew it. I blew it.

**Fallen:** If I was quicker to the trigger.

**Woodlock:** If I could have positioned the team better. Prepared them better.

//He puts his elbow on the table at his side and leans on it.//

**Fallen:** The turnout would have been the same. You did all you could.

**Woodlock:** And it wasn&#39;t enough.

//The two are silent; the only noise heard is the beeping of the nearby machinery.//

//A knocking is heard on the door. Woodlock stands up and walks over to open it, and Interim Director Samuel steps inside.//

**Samuel:** Mortimer. Leon.

**Woodlock:** What do you want now?

**Samuel:** Besides the obvious, I wanted to discuss the future of Sigma-8.

**Woodlock:** What&#39;s the damage?

**Samuel:** You&#39;ve proven highly ineffective in this case. Every single deployment of your team has displayed high casualties and no results. Higher-up, more professional task forces are being discussed for your replacement.

**Woodlock:** So what&#39;s to be done with us?

**Samuel:** You will receive no further funding for augmentations, training, equipment, or otherwise. The remaining operatives will be reassigned.

**Woodlock:** And myself?

**Samuel:** The Foundation has noticed that you showed extensive bravery during the latest incident; going in without your team and living to tell the tale and all. You showed satisfactory professionalism during it, and your judgment did not appear to be overly influenced by your past. You will be reassigned to whatever task force takes over for this project.

**Fallen:** What about me?

**Samuel:** You displayed the opposite. You will be returned to junior research activities, and your enhancements will be surgically removed.

**Fallen:** That thing cut off my fucking leg!

**Samuel:** After you disclosed your personal history with it and attempted to terminate it without proper authorization.

**Fallen:** Termina- We haven&#39;t even contained it yet!

**Samuel:** And now that affair will be handled by more capable hands. The Foundation thanks you for your service and wishes you a swift recovery.

**Fallen:** Get out.

**Samuel:** Watch your tone, researcher.

//He turns to Woodlock.//

**Samuel:** Mortimer, these are for you.

//He hands Woodlock a file of papers before turning around and leaving. Woodlock takes them and looks over them briefly before tossing them over onto a nearby table.//

**Woodlock:** They got bupkis.

**Fallen:** We worked for months to capture those two-

**Woodlock:** And they reassigned us when we weren&#39;t fit for the job. They&#39;ll put some real good teams on it, I&#39;m sure.

**Fallen:** And I&#39;ll never know with a shitty junior researcher clearance level.

**Woodlock:** It&#39;s in good hands now.

**Fallen:** We thought we were good hands at first too.

**Woodlock:** We were.

**Fallen:** You don&#39;t seem all that phased that the fucker-

**Woodlock:** Quit swearing.

**Fallen:** -That the fuckers who killed your team and my dad are just walking away scot-free right now!

**Woodlock:** //Knock it off//.

**Fallen:** While we sit here on our asses being told off by some dickhead in a suit who didn&#39;t lose shit his entire life!

**Woodlock:** Agent Leonel-

**Fallen:** Ex-agent, Captain!

//The Captain stands.//

**Woodlock:** //Agent// Fallen, shut your trap //for once!//

**Woodlock:** We both have problems. Your dad is dead. My team is dead. You don&#39;t need to keep reminding me every five minutes just to support whatever point you&#39;re trying to make. Either move on or fall behind, but don&#39;t make me have to carry your shitty little emotions on my back as well.

**Woodlock:** Man up!

//He picks up the documents, walks to the door, and heads out.//

//Fallen watches him leave. He visibly strains himself for a moment before trying his best to turn away. His hands move over his face.//
