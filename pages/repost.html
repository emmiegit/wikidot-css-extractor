I&#39;ll be honest with you. This is shit. It&#39;s really only going up because a few people in the chat encouraged me to put it up, and I really don&#39;t know what else to do with it.

Roight. Now that we&#39;re done with the self-depreciation...
***
&#34;Um, sir?&#34;

&#34;Yes, Moyle?&#34;

&#34;We appear to have a spot of trouble.&#34;

&#34;What sort of spot of trouble?&#34;

&#34;Well, you know those SCPs? Those things in all of our cells?&#34;

&#34;Yes?&#34;

&#34;Well, they&#39;ve gone and done it again.&#34;

&#34;Dear lord. Again?&#34;

&#34;Again, sir.&#34;

&#34;What is this, the third time?&#34;

&#34;Fifth.&#34;

&#34;Dear lord. We&#39;ll have to explain why Burma&#39;s not on the map again.&#34;

&#34;Sir. I&#39;m not talking about them doing that again.&#34;

&#34;Ah. Which that again are we talking about?&#34;

&#34;They went and deleted the archive again.&#34;

&#34;How do you mean? They&#39;ve done it so many ways, you know.&#34;

&#34;Well, if you look at the database, it&#39;s returning everything as &#39;access denied.&#39;&#34;

&#34;Have you tried breaking in through the back way?&#34;

&#34;Both my best computing skills and homosexuality have both failed us, sir.&#34;

&#34;Oh dear.&#34;

&#34;I know. The situation appears rather grim.&#34;

&#34;Are the SCPs all there?&#34;

&#34;Well, from what I can tell, most of them are. I can&#39;t exactly check them all right now, sir, but I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;re all still there.&#34;

&#34;Well then, you know what we&#39;ll have to do now.&#34;

&#34;Right then. I&#39;ll go put up the decorations.&#34;

&#34;We&#39;re not going to blow up the bloody base, Moyle. I&#39;m talking about rewriting the SCPs.&#34;

&#34;Oh.&#34;

&#34;You look like you&#39;re hiding something from me. What is it Moyle?&#34;

&#34;Well, you know those employees we have? The scientists and researchers and doctors and whatnot?&#34;

&#34;Yes?&#34;

&#34;They&#39;re all dead.&#34;

&#34;How?&#34;

&#34;Gunshots to the head, sir.&#34;

&#34;Oh dear. Any idea why they did that?&#34;

&#34;Well, I found a note on their corpses, sir.&#34;

&#34;Yes?&#34;

&#34;They all wrote the exact same thing.&#34;

&#34;And that exact same thing was?&#34;

&#34;They have all written, &#39;We have chosen to commit suicide rather than continue working for the Foundation because the bloke running it is,&#39; and I quote, &#39;a lilly-livered, horn-rimmed glasses wearing monster, who we all consider a shitfaced bloody bastard.&#39;&#34;

&#34;Huh.&#34;

&#34;They put a special emphasis on the word bastard, sir.&#34;

&#34;I figured they would. You know what we need to do, correct?&#34;

&#34;Considering the situation, we&#39;ll need to hire some more people.&#34;

&#34;Correct.&#34;

&#34;Well, there&#39;s a problem there too, sir.&#34;

&#34;What would that be?

&#34;Well, we can afford to rehire the guards, and the scientists, and the researchers, and the doctors, and the administrators…&#34;

&#34;But?&#34;

&#34;But the cost of hiring new writers is through the roof. Unless you find someone who is extremely generous, there&#39;s no way to hire a single new author.&#34;

&#34;Why can&#39;t the others do it?&#34;

&#34;Well, even though it&#39;s their jobs, the reports the researchers make are always highly unprofessional. You need a writer to make sure his work is good.&#34;

&#34;We could always do it ourselves.&#34;

&#34;Are you willing to do that much work for yourself, sir?&#34;

&#34;Well, no.&#34;

&#34;And I&#39;m not willing to do it either. So you see the problem.&#34;

&#34;So I do.&#34;

&#34;Do you have any ideas, sir?&#34;

&#34;Well, what did we do the last time this happened?&#34;

&#34;If I remember correctly, it required more cattle prods than we can reasonably afford.&#34;

&#34;And you say it&#39;s too expensive to hire any new writers?&#34;

&#34;Yes, sir.&#34;

&#34;We could trick people on the internet to do it for us.&#34;

&#34;Sir?&#34;

&#34;Look here at this website. Average imageboard, right? Well, what say if I were to do a sloppy write-up of a random SCP? And if we get a few people to promote it as a great writing idea, set up a website around it?&#34;

&#34;I still don&#39;t see how that solves our problem, sir.&#34;

&#34;Well, we&#39;ve got hundreds of thousands of objects to rewrite. If we get enough people on-board with this, they&#39;re bound to come up with something like what we&#39;ve really got. We&#39;ll just take whichever ones we can and use them to fill in the archive. Reject the rest, you know?&#34;

&#34;How will we make it seem… well, not suspicious?&#34;

&#34;Simple enough. Write them off as bad writing.&#34;

&#34;You know, sir, thinking about it, it&#39;s a rather brilliant idea. Just one problem with it.&#34;

&#34;Yes?&#34;

&#34;Neither of us is the best writer. What if they chose to take whichever SCP we put out there and stick it on a pedestal? Make it so that we aren&#39;t able to edit it properly, just because it&#39;s the quote-unquote &#39;First?&#39;&#34;

&#34;Well, once we have enough money to hire some proper writers, we just execute everyone involved.&#34;

&#34;Doesn&#39;t that put us in a similar situation as now if the writers we hire commit suicide as well?&#34;

&#34;Well, then, we think about that when we get there, now don&#39;t we?&#34;

&#34;Isn&#39;t that how we got into this mess in the first place, sir?&#34;

&#34;No. That one involved beers.&#34;

&#34;Ah, yes. Care for one now?

&#34;Sure, Moyle, sure.&#34;
