**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6307 in its entirety is secured on-site at Site-122 in Subterranean Section A. Personnel assigned to the SCP-6307 project, Mobile Task Force Beta-17 &#34;Truck Freaks,&#34; and Logistics and Transportation Division Admin are the only individuals permitted to enter SCP-6307&#39;s containment unit for research and maintenance purposes. Technical personnel are mandated to refrain from tampering with or altering SCP-6307&#39;s current wiring setup.

Any aberrations in SCP-6307&#39;s daily logs and any unusual supply requests are to be reported to the SCP-6307 team immediately.

------

**Description:** SCP-6307 is a massive, sophisticated computer network built some time between the early 1970s and 1982. SCP-6307, in its current state, is made up of the following components:
* Five DataBank 1012 computers[[footnote]]A now-archaic multi-purpose computer built by the Foundation, and used until the late 1980s. These were known, rather infamously, for their bulky nature, with one DataBank taking up almost the entirety of a single room.[[/footnote]], engraved with standard SCP Foundation identification.
* Approximately 0.5km worth of wiring and tubing, connecting the DataBanks to a central mainframe unit.
* A homebrew computer unit constructed from a hybrid of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/prometheus-labs-hub Prometheus Labs] and DataBank 1012 computer parts. This unit is engraved with a &#34;Property of the SCP Foundation&#34; placard on its side.
* A terminal connected to the homebrew computer unit, with an LCD display, keyboard, and mouse, running an outdated version of the Foundation&#39;s current operating system and SkipNet[[footnote]]Slang for the intranet used by the Foundation[[/footnote]].

SCP-6307 greatly assists in the monitoring, maintenance, and fulfillment of virtually all logistical matters pertaining to the Foundation. The system automates most processes regarding supply chain management, Site resupply, personnel transfer, and inventory logging, and maintains constant contact with every major Foundation Site in order to fulfill the supply demands of the Foundation as a whole.

Although many of SCP-6307&#39;s components are outdated by modern technical standards, the system is capable of fully integrating with the rest of the Foundation, provided it achieves regular maintenance.

SCP-6307 requires little human input in order to function properly. This is achieved in part due to an [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ai-classification-guide artificial intelligence construct] housed within the network, a Class-IV Positive-Aligned Narrow Intelligence known as Sneed.aic. //(See: History)//

Sneed.aic, although sentient, is rather narrow-minded in its tasks, only ever choosing to speak if addressed directly. For this reason, and to maximize productivity, personnel assigned to SCP-6307 are advised to refrain from engaging in casual conversation with the AI.

----

**History:** The construction of SCP-6307 began in 1968, when former RAISA computer technician Terry Sneed drafted a proposal to the O5 Council for Project Galactica, an effort to fully digitalize the Foundation&#39;s logistical records for ease of access and storage. While highly-promising on paper, Project Galactica was ultimately rejected, due to the then-superfluous costs associated with fully-digitizing the Foundation&#39;s records. 

However, the O5 Council would direct Sneed to Dr. Isaac Whitaker of the Logistics &amp; Transportation division, whom had a similar goal in mind with his drastic reform of the department he now led. Sneed and Whitaker would later become founding members of the department, and would collaborate on a myriad of projects, including a prototype logistical computer network built inside Section A of the fledgling Site-122.

|caption=Terry Sneed, circa 1970
]]

In 1971, with approval of the O5 Council, Terry Sneed would acquire 5 Foundation DataBank 1012 computers, and began construction of what would later become SCP-6307. Originally unaided in his process, a number of L&amp;T personnel would soon pitch in to the monumental effort, including Dr. Whitaker himself. Although some team members believed that Sneed&#39;s project was ultimately futile, costly, and time-consuming, Dr. Whitaker supported the project wholeheartedly, and personally assisted Sneed in constructing and testing SCP-6307 on multiple occasions.

In March of 1982, halfway through the construction of the SCP-6307 terminal, Terry Sneed would suddenly die in his sleep, and progress on the project froze. With an inspection date of May 1982 approaching, Whitaker took charge of the project and rushed its completion, referencing heavily from Sneed&#39;s rather incomprehensible notes and blueprints.

During the inspection, it was discovered that SCP-6307&#39;s internal software and several hardware components had been modified through anomalous means to account for a 50% increase in processing power and data storage. In addition, an artificial intelligence construct identifying itself as Sneed.aic was present in the terminal, which no member of the team had any recollection of implementing whatsoever.

----

= **Addendum 6307.1:**
= Initial Contact

With no way to properly verify Sneed.aic (then-designated as SCP-6307-B) as a Foundation-made program, SCP-6307 was officially registered as an anomaly in late May of 1982, and was placed into containment in Section A of Site-122. Dr. Whitaker was personally tasked with conducting an interview with SCP-6307-B to ascertain its directive and identify any other changes anomalously made to the machine.

Following the interview, SCP-6307-B, now officially verified as Sneed.aic, was returned to active duty. After a brief consultation with the Classification Committee, SCP-6307 was reclassified as Thaumiel, and a containment unit housing SCP-6307 in its entirety was constructed at Site-122.

= **Addendum 6307.2:**
= Project Update

Below is an update pushed by Dr. Whitaker regarding SCP-6307&#39;s performance on February 16, 1984.

[[&lt;]]
[[div class=&#34;email&#34;]]
[[div class=&#34;tofrom&#34;]]
**To:** SCP-6307 Staff, L&amp;T Admin
**Bcc:** Overwatch Command
**From:** Dr. Isaac Whitaker
**Subject:** 6307 update 2/16/1984
[[/div]]
------
Team,

Impressive is an understatement. SCP-6307 remains in regular working order as of writing this message. Upon its completion and the integration of Sneed.aic, we saw positive results almost immediately. Throughput across the Foundation has increased drastically, and our delivery times have similarly decreased. This machine does not do //all// of the work for us, of course, but to call it useful is an understatement — it is //vital//. That is why, effective immediately, I am asking for the weekly maintenance checks to now become daily maintenance checks. Any abnormalities are to be reported and dealt with.

Following the installation, though, I noticed a few oddities in SCP-6307&#39;s daily reports, as well as a few unusual requests. There is definitely something strange and peculiar to the machine&#39;s mannerisms. One noteworthy example is when I found out it had transferred a great deal of its maintenance staff to Armed Site-21, requesting an equal transfer of technicians from AS-21 to our Site in return. 

In the meantime, I&#39;ve assigned Mobile Task Force Beta-17 &#34;Truck Freaks&#34; to follow up on any unusual requests and their intended destination. Should any more of these discrepancies become known to me, I will push out an additional update.

= **Addendum 6307.3:**
= Additional SCP-6307 Correspondence

Although SCP-6307 remained in regular operation for much of the 90s and onwards, its hardware still remained vastly outdated; old and nearly incompatible with newer, more experimental systems. With the rest of the Foundation speedily digitalizing their systems and records, SCP-6307 was steadily upgraded with more antiquated software and hardware, though its setup remained mostly unchanged.

On 7/18/1998, a heated email exchange between Director Whitaker and Dr. Marcus L. Crassus of Armed Site-21[[footnote]]A large facility located outside of ██████, Colorado, serving as Site-122&#39;s largest client and sister facility.[[/footnote]] was observed, regarding a few incidents in SCP-6307 and its behavior.

Below is the exchange in its entirety.

Dr. Whitaker,

I hope today will be the last time I email you regarding SCP-6307.

Containment for [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5778 SCP-5778] is a very costly endeavor, one which I am sure you are already aware of. So, when an important component for 5778&#39;s containment efforts goes missing, I am sure that you can understand how frustrated I am beginning to feel about the object.

&gt; ||||||||~ Supply Order #9811703, 7/11/1998 ||
&gt; ||||||~ Item Name ||~ Quantity Requested ||||
&gt; |||||| Electrostatic Gate Components || 50 ||||

This order, which I have requested to be overnighted, has not shipped for a week. Our sites are within driving distance of each other, let alone flying, so I anticipate that it won&#39;t be difficult to see this one through.

Please respond if you have any other info regarding this discrepancy.

Marcus,

Firstly, I thank you for coming to me regarding this issue, and I hope to have it squared away within the hour.

Next, I advise that you adjust your tone when speaking to me, as your message has come off as very rude and passive aggressive to me. We are a team, and we should not be bickering with each other.

Mobile Task Force Beta-17 &#34;Truck Freaks&#34; has looked into your order and found that it has been delivered to an L&amp;T Warehouse in Boulder, in which it has remained for approximately a week. I can task a courier to retrieve the order and deliver it to Armed Site-21 by hand.

I apologize for the inconvenience.

Dr. Whitaker,

This is //precisely// the problem that I have with SCP-6307. That warehouse has remained //your// responsibility ever since we transferred control of it to Site-122... a year ago. SCP-6307&#39;s usefulness is not to be underappreciated, but its antiquated hardware and glitches are something that is becoming most concerning with me. Why did it not notify me of this change at all?

Thank you for sending the courier, but this is an error which is far too grave for me to just pass off.

//We// are up to date, why haven&#39;t //your// systems been updated as well?

Marcus,

Again, your tone.

Our asset is fine. L&amp;T will address any errors with SCP-6307 and fix them promptly. There is no need to be so inflammatory and aggressive in your correspondence.

Dr. Whitaker,

I was in the military. I understand logistics just as much as you do, and the importance of it.

My concerns are valid, given the importance of both our sites as cornerstones in the Foundation logistics network. If you have never gotten around to addressing all of SCP-6307&#39;s problems until //now//, you are effectively putting a band aid fix on a severed limb. Your retrofits can only keep it afloat and up to date for so long. I do not wish to speak ill about your asset, but it is only a matter of time before a catastrophic failure occurs with lasting consequences on the entire Foundation&#39;s supply chain.

I only hope a fix comes around before then.

Dr. Whitaker,

Yes. My concerns //are// valid, given the importance of our Sites and the anomalies we contain. I apologize for my heated behavior, but this is no laughing matter.

You were in the Foundation for much longer than me, and you have seen it grow into a truly global organization. The fact that you&#39;ve been giving a ghost the responsibility of operating a computer which automates all of our logistics raises many, many more concerns for me. You have been giving it enormous amounts of power and responsibility -- what will happen if a hostile group decides to take advantage of it?

I&#39;ve got no clue as to what goes on with that machine, and nor do I know why things are moved around to apparently random locations, rather than straight to the site. What I do know is this: the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.

Perhaps SCP-6307 needs to learn this as well.

Marcus,

SCP-6307 requires more power if it is able to function properly. I hope you understand. 

I reiterate that this issue has been fixed, and this argument is now over.

The following recording was delivered to Overwatch Command on June 17, 2000, by Agent Tanner, an operative of MTF Alpha-1 &#34;Red Right Hand&#34;.

= **ARCHIVAL RECORDING #6307-02**
= **ARCHIVE DATE:** 2100 HRS, JUNE 17, 2000
----
= **[BEGIN VIDEO]**

//[The cameraman watches as a white pickup truck marked with &#34;Shaun and Clancy Parcel Couriers&#34; approaches a compound labeled as a &#34;Shaun and Clancy Parcel Couriers Distribution Center.&#34; The pickup truck stops, and a man in a Shaun and Clancy uniform exits with a microcassette voice recorder in hand.]//

**[β-17 Operative:]** Okay... For the record. June 17, 2000. Beta-17 investigating an unusual 6307 daily log, investigating the delivery site.

//[The agent nonchalantly approaches the compound, entering a blind spot on the CCTV camera mounted by the entrance.]//

**[β-17 Operative:]** Distribution center appears to be normal, no sign of a break-in.

//[The cameraman emerges suddenly, drawing a handgun and stepping towards the agent.]//

**[TANNER:]** Recorder. Off.

**[β-17 Operative:]** What the fu—

//[Tanner points his weapon at the man. The operative reaches for his own handgun, but pauses as Tanner&#39;s free hand lifts up his hoodie to reveal a badge on his belt. He then throws his hands in the air, setting the tape recorder down. Tanner picks up the tape recorder, purging its contents up until the confrontation, before placing it back in the Beta-17 operative&#39;s pocket.]//

**[β-17 Operative:]** Oh. You gotta be fuckin&#39; kidding me, man. You&#39;re a—

**[TANNER:]** Delivery #0006175. Is it inside?

**[β-17 Operative:]** Yes.

**[TANNER:]** I was never here. You&#39;ll be back in an hour.

//[The Beta-17 operative begins to say something to protest, but then stops as Tanner reveals a fractal symbol printed on a folded up sheet of copy paper. He lets out a long groan as his eyes roll back into his head, then is rendered incapacitated by the memetic agent.]//

//[Tanner grabs his body as it goes limp, turning a dial on his wristwatch for a moment, then drags the man back to the pickup truck. He places him in the driver seat, then steps away from the truck.]//

----
= **[VIDEO INPUT: L&amp;T DISTRIBUTION CENTER EXTERNAL CAMERA 01]**
----

//[A semi-translucent mass of pixels slowly approaches a white pickup truck parked in front of the facility. What happens next is blurred and incomprehensible due to heavy noise on the video, but the shimmer is seen turning and moving slowly back towards the facility, passing beneath the camera&#39;s blind spot again.]//

//[Further footage is lost due to video corruption.]//

----
= **[VIDEO INPUT: AGENT TANNER&#39;S CAMERA]**
----

//[Agent Tanner places his white and blue keycard from a retractable lanyard against the front door&#39;s RFID reader. The omni keycard unlocks the door with ease, and Tanner steps inside the building. It is empty and dark, and Tanner activates the night vision device mounted on his head and camera to guide his way through the building.]//

//[Tanner passes through an empty lobby and turns the dial on his watch again, passing by a security office with the lights currently on. He enters another door and finds himself in a large warehouse, stocked with unmarked boxes, racks, and pallets full of supplies. He steps past aisles made from metal racks, boxes of miscellaneous items stacked upon the shelves.]//

//[After some time passes, Tanner comes upon a section indicating outgoing items, and approaches a container trailer parked in front of a large garage. He climbs up onto the trailer, and tests the lift gate on it to see if it is locked.]//

**[TANNER:]** //(Whispering)// Locked.

//[Tanner kneels down and pulls out a set of lockpicks, unlocking the trailer&#39;s lift gate and pushing it up. Inside are several boxes on pallets; Tanner approaches one of the boxes and opens it up.]//

**[TANNER:]** //(Whispering)// Computer parts. No— DataBank 1012 components.

//[Closing the box, Tanner inspects yet another box.]//

**[TANNER:]** //(Whispering)// DataBank 1012 Compact Data Drives. 6307 only has four, why do they need six?

//[He closes the box, opening up a third.]//

**[TANNER:]** AIC processor chip—one of the more recent ones. Who the hell ordered this to be sent here?

**[OVERWATCH:]** //(In earpiece)// It appears SCP-6307 did.

**[TANNER:]** But why? These types of components are hard to come by. If that&#39;s to be believed, then 6307 is moving stuff around for its own benefit.

//[Tanner inspects the boxes again for a moment.]//

**[TANNER:]** //Why?//

**[OVERWATCH:]** Your guess as to why this is happening is as good as mine, but don&#39;t be so surprised if the ghost has any ulterior motives. This is something that is most concerning. Find where the shipment is intended to be dropped off.

**[TANNER:]** The destination on this is...

//[Tanner leaves the trailer, lowering the lift gate and inspecting an address attached to the gate lock.]//

**[TANNER:]** ██████, Colorado, ██████.

//[Tanner closes the lift gate on the trailer, locking it.]//

**[OVERWATCH:]** Extract. We have what we need.

**[TANNER:]** Understood.

//[Tanner&#39;s camera deactivates.]//

----

//[An MTF Beta-17 operative gets out of a white pickup truck in front of the facility, yawning loudly. He holds a microcassette voice recorder up to his mouth as he rubs his eyes.]//

**[β-17 Operative:]** Okay... for the record. June 17, 2000. Beta-17 conducting further investigation an unusual 6307 shipment, investigating the delivery site.

//[The agent approaches the compound, entering a blind spot on the CCTV camera mounted by the entrance.]//
