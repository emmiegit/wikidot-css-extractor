**Item #:** SCP-7298

**Object Class:** Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Instances of the SCP-7298 phenomenon are to be removed off store shelves or during manufacturing by inspecting packs of Coca-Cola brand soda for a &#34;Made in Montenegro&#34; sticker, which may be attached to either the back of the packaging or the can itself. The Coca-Cola company executives and CEO James Quincey[[footnote]]James Quincey is the current CEO of the Coca-Cola Company.[[/footnote]] have been made aware of this issue via the United States government. They have given the Foundation full access to check most if not all packs of Coca-Cola brand soda for SCP-7298. This process is intended to limit the number of SCP-7298 phenomena from occurring, as the event itself is incapable of being stopped upon activation. Additionally, the SCP-7298 factory will stay under Foundation surveillance until further notice.  

**Description:** SCP-7298 is a phenomenon that occurs every three years, affecting random packs of Coca-Cola brand soda during manufacturing. This anomaly is always marked by an attached sticker on the beverage showing the flag of Montenegro containing text reading &#34;Made in Montenegro&#34;, only written in different languages depending on the destined location of the shipment. 
 
Upon consuming an SCP-7298 affected Coca-Cola beverage, a red Coca-Cola delivery truck will materialize out of visual sight where it will park in a discrete location. The consumer will then experience a Cognito Hazard causing a wave of enthusiasm regarding the beverage, and subsequentially vocalizing the phrase: //&#34;I need more of this stuff hell yeah!&#34;// Immediately after this exclamation, the consumer will sprint to the location of the delivery truck, which will open its back doors. As the consumer approaches the vehicle, multiple Nintendo brand R.O.B. robot toys over 2 meters tall will grab the consumer and take it inside of the delivery trailer, immediately driving off whilst the Cognito Hazard&#39;s effects wear off.
 
The source of this phenomenon is unknown, however, an investigation by Foundation field agents within Montenegro reveals an undocumented factory run by an undisclosed owner that may have an alias known as &#34;Roger Aluminum&#34; who presumably orchestrates this phenomenon. 
 
**Addendum: Failed Investigation** The following is an exploration log detailing an investigation into the previously mentioned factory through the walk-in tours that were advertised on fliers observed around the city of Podgorica, Montenegro. Agent Elizabeth Diko was chosen for this operation because of her fluent knowledge of the Montenegrin language and her inconspicuous approach to operations. Additionally, she was given a concealable recording device and firearm in case of an emergency.

**Exploration Video Log Transcript**

**Date:** October 21st,12:42pm, 2014

**Member(s):** Agent Elizabeth Diko
 
**Subject:** Undocumented Factory in Podgorica, Montenegro. 
 
Note that this log is roughly translated from Montenegrin.

[BEGIN LOG]
 
//Agent Diko enters the building guided by cardboard signs reading &#34;Free soda!&#34; and &#34;Come on in!&#34;. Upon entering, a middle-aged man is seen frantically shuffling papers at a desk.//
 
**Agent Diko:** Excuse me, I&#39;m here about the tour you advertised. I saw your fliers around town. 
 
//No response. Agent Diko approaches the desk.//
 
**Agent Diko:** Excuse me, I&#39;m here about the tour. Are you still giving those?
 
//The man looks up and stands up quickly.//
 
**Unknown:** Oh, uh-I mean, welcome to the Made In Montenegro Corporation, (M.I.M.). Would you like a soda? Want two? I-I have two of them...
 
**Agent Diko:** No thanks... I just wanted a tour. 
 
**Unknown:** I-I didn&#39;t think anyone was going to come so we canceled it... But you just so happened to walk in before closing time so...Okay, okay. We should-uh, start that now. My name is Radus Branislav, I do just about everything for the boss, Aluminum. I mean, that&#39;s a nickname but he wants to just go by that... N-nothing else. 
 
**Agent Diko:** Okay, good morning Mister Branislav. 
 
**Branislav:** Uh, yeah sure whatever just follow me, Miss. 
 
//Agent Diko follows Branislav around the factory for thirty minutes observing miscellaneous rooms until the main manufacturing room is in view. Numerous people are seen dressed in factory uniforms while applying stickers on copious amounts of Coca-Cola soda cans, all under the surveillance of R.O.B. robot toys. The workers appear to be physically injured, and some are lying on the ground. Branislav takes out a bottle of painkillers and quickly eats them before speaking again.//
 
**Branislav:** This is the manufacturing room. Those cans are M.I.M. Sodas being packaged for the public and ready for shipping next year. Those sodas are very good, you know... You should try one. I&#39;ve had twenty today. 
 
**Agent Diko:** I don&#39;t believe that to be healthy, sir. Do you feel okay? 
 
**Branislav:** Yes...Yes, I do. God... I need more of those sodas, more! I need so much more...
 
**Agent Diko:** Are you... Sir?
 
**Branislav:** Oh! My apologies, I just... My bad, I was in my own little world you know? Heh, heh. 
 
**Agent Diko:** Uhm, Are those workers okay? They seem really hot, maybe you should get some air conditioning here. 
 
**Branislav:** No. 
 
//There is a moment of silence.//
 
**Agent Diko:** I... Okay then. What else is there around here? Maybe you can show me where those sodas are going?
 
//Branislav&#39;s cell phone begins ringing.//
 
**Branislav:** E-excuse me. I need to take this. Don&#39;t go anywhere, don&#39;t touch anything...
 
//Branislav enters a nearby office and closes the door behind him. He begins to yell while talking on his phone, and Agent Diko leans closer to the door listening to the conversation while appearing inconspicuous.//
 
**Branislav:** L-look here Al, I do the most work here, don&#39;t I? I&#39;ve done so much to get this damn company on its feet, and here you are acting like a god. Listen, boss. I ain&#39;t got many workers left, some had to get taken out back and others are borderline dead. I can&#39;t pull any more people than this out my ass, you got it? We pull only, like, what? Less than a hundred people doing this crap? What about all that Coke we stole just so you can act like you own a soda business? 
 
//A moment of silence.//
 
**Branislav:** Shut up with that! I-I&#39;m about to faint! I&#39;m gonna throw up... Just stop yelling at me, please. I don&#39;t want to throw up again I-I just took my meds, I need my meds! This is all your fault you know! 
 
//Another moment of silence.//
 
**Branislav:** Just shut up! Stop yelling at me! I know what&#39;s going to happen if our quota isn&#39;t met! I&#39;m not stupid, I know how to run a business, unlike you Al! 
 
//Agent Diko leans closer in, then notices a R.O.B. robot toy watching her. She immediately turns the other way from the door avoiding eye contact. The toy begins to light up, and a slight whirring sound is heard. It begins to speak shortly after.//
 
**R.O.B. Robot Toy:** Espionage. 
 
**Agent Diko:** Excuse me? 
 
**R.O.B. Robot Toy:** Espionage... Espionage... 
 
//Agent Diko begins to slowly back away.//
 
**R.O.B. Robot Toy:** Threat detected. Code-51, &#34;Eavesdropper&#34;. Kill mode initiated. 
 
//Agent Dinko begins to flee whilst attempting to use her firearm on the toy. The toy in response fires what sounds to be a barrage of bullets at Agent Diko neutralizing her. However, her recording device is still active. A siren is heard around the factory.//
 
**Branislav:** O-oh, god! What the hell have you done? What were you thinking? That&#39;s-
 
//Branislav is heard regurgitating and weeping.//
 
**Branislav:** You s-sick peice of.. You... You! Why?
 
**R.O.B. Robot Toy:** My protocols require me to neutralize threats to the company. She was a spy. I knew from my robot gut. 
 
**Branislav:** What are you talking about? You don&#39;t have a gut! You don&#39;t have guts you&#39;re a damn robot, you don&#39;t! Her brains are s-splattered everywhere! Everywhere! And it&#39;s your fault! Yours! 
 
//Branislav begins to weep again.//
 
[END LOG]
 
Agent Diko&#39;s body was recovered in the rear trash dump behind the factory alongside her recording device. Including other bodies of known missing persons who were most likely affected by SCP-7298. 
 
&#34;Radus Branislav&#34; does not exist according to birth certificates, and The Made In Montenegro Corporation does not exist either as a legitimate company. &#34;Roger Aluminum&#34; is currently being tracked down at the time of documentation.
