**Item #:** SCP-7298

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** The following procedures are no longer considered applicable to the referenced anomalies. Any further information on previous containment procedures can be requested via SCiPNET email to Senior Researcher Davis Cunningham[[footnote]] cunningham2@fo.scip.net[[/footnote]].

Due to **Incident 7298-02**, Foundation personnel are to be reminded that Site-02, currently, does not exist. No further extraction attempts will be conducted until SCP-7298-1&#39;s player count reaches a safe number (&lt;25).

[[collapsible show=&#34;Archived Containment Procedures&#34; hide=&#34;Hide Archived Containment Procedures&#34;]]
SCP-7298 is located in a private storage unit on Site-02, along with all supporting physical documentation. Access to the containment area is restricted to Level 4 personnel or individuals with written Site Director approval. All entry points to the containment area are to be monitored by surveillance cameras and motion detectors. 

No Wi-Fi routers, ethernet cables, or other devices allowing SCP-7298 access to the internet are allowed in the containment unit. Reality anchors, planned for construction, are to be maintained in a grid pattern throughout Site-02 to counteract the effects of SCP-7298. In the event of unauthorized activation, it would act as an automated fail-safe system. 

No Foundation personnel are authorized to have SCP-7298-1 installed on their personal or work electronic devices.

**Description:** SCP-7298[[footnote]] SCP-7298 has some level of recorded sapience. See IL.01[[/footnote]] is a standard Dell© laptop that bears minimal damage to its surface in the form of scratches and small dents. Once turned on, a computer program named &#34;PLACEHOLDER&#34; will immediately start. It will begin manipulating the environment around it, manifesting it into its own playable video game (SCP-7298-1). 

SCP-7298-1 is __currently__ an online multiplayer video game titled &#34;SCP: Secret Laboratory&#34;. The core gameplay is relatively complete, but there are numerous --consistent-- inconsistent updates to the game. It primarily involves players taking on the roles of various personnel employed by the Foundation but also its contained anomalous entities. In the aftermath of Incident 7298-02, it has gained popularity within the gaming community. 

One of the main features of SCP-7298 is the ability to control an individual&#39;s physical functions[[footnote]] Individuals are still conscious during this process[[/footnote]] who have become integrated into SCP-7298-1. If an individual enters SCP-7298&#39;s area of influence, SCP-7298 will gather their data and place it inside the SCP-7298-1 program for usage. Due to this, their physical movements would then be surrendered to an outside player[[footnote]] An individual who has access to SCP-7298-1.[[/footnote]] who uses them as a means to play in SCP-7298-1. 

It is worth noting that the entities present within SCP-7298-1 are digital constructs. Their appearance, actions, or damage done to them have no bearing on their physical body[[footnote]] Killed entities, for example, do not stay dead.[[/footnote]]. Further research is ongoing to understand the exact mechanisms behind SCP-7298 as well as explore the possibility of safely using SCP-7298-1 for training and containment exercises.

It is unknown how multiple servers of SCP-7298-1 exist, but it is theorized that the original source is copied and multiplied, suggesting that an individual in SCP-7298-1 is not undergoing one &#34;simulation&#34; but all of them simultaneously.

[[module ListPages limit=&#34;1&#34; category=&#34;*&#34; order=&#34;updated_at desc&#34;]]
As of %%updated_at|%Y/%m/%d%%, no recovery attempts have been made.

**Discovery**: SCP-7298 was discovered on April 15, 2012, when a significant number of &#34;glitches&#34; and &#34;weird dimensions&#34; were reported outside of Northwood Studios Headquarters. Individuals exposed to SCP-7298 recalled being a part of an office story-based video game. During the Foundation raid on Northwood Studios, it was determined that SCP-7298 was the cause of the anomalous emitting properties. All servers, as well as physical evidence and electronic data, were confiscated and relocated to Site-02. Hubert Moszka, CEO of Northwood Studios, denied any responsibility, stating he had never seen SCP-7298. Extensive research into the origins of SCP-7298 is ongoing.

**Incident Log 7298-01: Breach of Security (Site-02)**

On ██/██/2017, a containment breach occurred within Site-02 due to unauthorized access to SCP-7298. Researcher Jessica Roberts entered SCP-███&#39;s observation chamber, discovering SCP-███ was not present inside. Security footage shows Security Officers Saul Blam and Joshua Grada using SCP-7298-1 on their work terminals, controlling breached SCP instances within Site-02. These instances were capable of utilizing their anomalous properties and breached containment protocols, resulting in the injury and death of multiple Foundation personnel. 

The breach ended twenty-three minutes later after Security Officers Blam and Grada were apprehended. After shutting down the Foundation terminals, the SCP instances immediately fell into a comatose state. The SCPs were put back into their respective containment chambers and regained consciousness shortly thereafter. When the security officers were interviewed, they thought they were &#34;just playing a video game&#34; that was universally installed on their work devices. Both officers requested resignation from the Foundation and were approved to be rehabilitated in society following punishment. 

Due to these incidents, further research is ongoing to determine the extent of its anomalous properties. Efforts to secure and neutralize any unauthorized copies of SCP-7298-1 within Site-02 and other Foundation facilities are ongoing.

**Incident Log 7298-02: Threat Detected (Site-02)**

On December 29, 2017, Site-02 reported a containment breach and emitted an LRC: 02/A/WHITE[[footnote]]Site-02, priority Level A, an assault of a highly-organized major/minor assimilation force that on-site security is unable to combat[[/footnote]]. Epsilon-11 (&#34;Nine Tailed Fox&#34;) was immediately dispatched, but upon entering Site-02, Epsilon-11 lost communication with Overwatch command. On December 30th, 2017, it was declared that Site-02 was &#34;lost&#34;.

It is theorized that a hostile incursion force, most likely the Chaos Insurgency, entered the site via Gate Alpha. The incursion force made its way to SCP-7298, firing upon Foundation personnel. Upon entering the containment chamber, they connected SCP-7298 to the internet and uploaded SCP-7298-1 to the public. SCP-7298-1 was immediately downloaded by multiple individuals, reaching a high player count in a couple of minutes. Upon doing so, Site-02&#39;s communications went offline. 

Due to Incident 7298-02, SCP-7298-1 has been made public, and all previous efforts to apprehend copies have failed. Efforts are ongoing to end the spread of SCP-7298-1 in hopes of reviving Site-02. Possible attempts have been made:

* Cutting Site-02&#39;s power supply | ##red|No Effect##
