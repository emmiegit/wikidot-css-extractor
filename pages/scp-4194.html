**Item #:** SCP-4194

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4194 instances within Foundation possession are to be secured in standard avian containment enclosures. Eggs laid by SCP-4194 instances are to be frozen and held in storage.

**Description:** SCP-4194 is an avian species, genetically identical to passenger pigeons (//Ectopistes migratorius//). While their appearance and behavior are identical to common //Ectopistes migratorius//, SCP-4194 instances are unable to produce offspring with them.

SCP-4194 is unable to perceive human beings. This lack of perception extends to depictions of humans as well, including photos, drawings, and mannequins. No genetic or cognitive cause for this anomaly has yet been discovered.

Due to their anomalous effects, SCP-4194 instances have an extreme disadvantage in the wild. While estimating the original date of SCP-4194 extinction is difficult due to their similarity to passenger pigeons, evidence suggests it may have been as early as 1898, about 16 years before the extinction of common passenger pigeons.

The SCP-4194 instances now contained by the Foundation are clones of original instances, produced by a civilian organization that experimented on extinct species, such as passenger pigeons. Instances were first thought to be the result of an unknown genetic flaw developed during the cloning process, but cognitive testing revealed their anomalous effects when attempting to perceive humans, resulting in the intervention of Foundation personnel.

**Addendum:** In 12/15/2017, the following document was found in the revision history of SCP-████ documentation during a routine check of the Foundation database. The document was severely corrupted. Research to reveal possible connections between this document and SCP-4194 is ongoing.
&gt; **Item #:** SCP-████
&gt; 
&gt; **Object Class:** Keter
&gt; 
&gt; **Special Containment Procedures:** Mobile Task Force Epsilon-3 (&#34;Tyltyl And Mytyl&#34;) are to terminate every instance of SCP-████. If it is considered impossible to terminate all instances in a given area, MTF Epsilon-3 is to abandon the area and terminate any civilians. Containment fails if a million instances are extant, [DATA CORRUPTED].
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** SCP-████ are [DATA CORRUPTED], alike to passenger pigeons (//Ectopistes migratorius//). Objects have a collective consciousness, increasing their intelligence as their numbers grow.
&gt; 
&gt; The growth rate of SCP-████ is proportional to the number of human or human-like things (photos and pictures describing humans, mannequins, etc) they recognize, which is almost per █3█. As a result, a group of SCP-████ instances in an urban area poses a significant threat to human life after one day. Instances are aware of this fact, so they actively seek out human beings.
&gt; 
&gt; A sufficient number of SCP-████ instances are likely capable of surpassing the cognitive abilities of all mankind, combined. Also [DATA CORRUPTED], a SK-Class Dominance Shift Scenario is deemed likely.
&gt; 
&gt; **Addendum:** The current growth rate of SCP-████ projects a containment breach within █9 days. To prevent this situation, p███o██l b██t has been proposed, which would destroy &#39;[DATA CORRUPTED]&#39;, altering the idea of &#39;humanity&#39;. This will cause a intentional IK-Class Idea Failure Scenario.
&gt; 
&gt; It is not certain at this time if this proposal will neutralize all SCP-████. It is possible said action may doom humanity in an unforeseen way. Unfortunately, the Foundation sees no alternative. Only we can assume this burden. [DATA CORRUPTED], we will never miss that again.
&gt; 
&gt; God help our ideas.
