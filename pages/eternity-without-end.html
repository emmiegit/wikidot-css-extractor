I had been on this island for decades now. I should be dead. At the very least, I should be wrinkly and aching. But I&#39;m not. I&#39;m the same age I&#39;ve been since the beginning. They haven&#39;t aged either.

I thought it was paradise. I thought I was in heaven. I remember dying. I was young. Something hit me. Then I woke up here.

@@ @@
Paradise. White sand, sunny, warm, but not too warm. Palm trees as far as I could see. I felt like I had been here before. When I was younger. Maybe a vacation. I don&#39;t remember. Everything I want to remember I can&#39;t. But I still remember names. My family. My friends. Mine. I should&#39;ve forgotten by now. It&#39;s been too long. But I don&#39;t.

@@ @@
I walked for a bit, and found a house. No, a house wasn&#39;t the right term. More like a mansion. I loved it at the time. It was massive. So luxurious. And it was my favorite color. A light teal, the same color as the tropical sky of the island. i had no idea whose it was. I went in. There were two naked women, and a man. They had perfect bodies, perfect faces, perfect hair. Their names were Tom, Jasmine, and Maria. They said the mansion was mine, and they were mine too. I didn&#39;t trust them, but as the sun refused to set and the weather stayed the same, I finally believed them. They did whatever I wanted. It was like a fantasy come true.

@@ @@
I remember indulging. There was fruit everywhere. Some made me see things, others tasted like beer and scotch. I would eat it while lounging in the mansion. I couldn&#39;t imagine a more perfect life. The three served me. Their only goal was to please me. At first, I started simple. I explored the island, and it was mostly the same. A tranquil forest. No animals, no life, nothing. At the time, I thought it was a little strange, but I didn&#39;t mind it. There was a small hot spring in the middle with a rushing waterfall coming off of a cliff. I tried to trace the source of the water, but I couldn&#39;t. It was like the water had just appeared, and kept coming. 

@@ @@
I would relax by the beach. I set up a makeshift volleyball net, but realized I didn&#39;t have a ball. The mansion, as big as it was, was practically empty, besides a bit of furniture. So I hollowed out a coconut and used that. It worked well enough.

@@ @@
Most of my days went like that. I realized that the three would do anything I said, so I took advantage of it. There was lots of sex, with Tom, with Maria, with Jasmine. But I wanted to treat them like people, so I tried to balance it. I ate with them, walked with them, I tried to play coconut volleyball.

I kept trying to come up with activities to do with them, but eventually I stopped out of a combination of boredom and disquietment. I would still try to talk to them occasionally, even as I continued fucking them. But eventually, I stopped trying to humanize them, and treated them more like machines. Because that&#39;s what they were. Machines.

@@ @@
Months went by. My fantasies got more depraved, my days more indulgent. It was sex and drugs. Over and over again. It kept my mind off the growing restlessness I had on the island. The fruits got more and more psychedelic, but eventually I got used to even the most intense ones. Eventually, I couldn&#39;t take it anymore. I stopped the sex, stopped the fantasies, stopped the drugs. Dread had already settled in about the truth of this place; I was trapped here. 

@@ @@
I tried desperately to take my mind off it. I decided to channel my dread. I started drawing in the sand. I would go around the island and carve into it&#39;s soft textures and overlap until images came to fruition. They were terrible. I was never a very good artist. But I kept doing loops around the island, dragging my hands and feet through my works and kicking up waves of dunes until they covered what I had created, and then kept going. I got better. Occasionally, I would get lethargic, and stop. But then, my mind would wander. It usually took less than a day before I went back to drawing.

@@ @@
I did that for months. Years. My skills developed until I was better than any artist I could remember. When I would finish a loop around the island and came back to my old work, I barely recognized it. I kicked it up, and started again. And yet, I could never escape the dread. The panic. Each crash of the waves I heard aganist the shore reminded me of where I was, and where I was going to be for eternity. Each wave is a constant reminder that I was living in an artificial reality; time cannot exist without change. This island didn&#39;t have time; it had a puppet of it, a deeply flawed understanding of reality&#39;s everlasting inertia. 

@@ @@
I kept drawing, but the waves continued, and I eventually looped around the island only to realize I was creating the same things over and over again. I had reached my apotheosis. But there was no divine realization or universal truth. Just another reminder of time without change, existence without end.

I stopped drawing, and looked up at the sun. It had not set. I looked behind me to see the house. I walked towards it in a trance. Tom, Maria, and Jasmine stood outside, statues with smiles. I walked until my body was pressed against Jasmine&#39;s. I stared at her.

I dropped the bat and ran as deep into the forest as I could. As far from the shore as possible. I reached the hot spring, and dove into it. I felt my leg brush against a jagged edge of the rock, and the wound seared with pain. I held my head under the oasis and felt my lungs fill with burning water. Even amongst the rushing bubbles and the exploding pain, I could still hear the beach, and the gentle roar of the current.

I floated back up to the surface, my organs straining against the weight of the gallons of water I had ingested. As the pool filled with the red smoke pouring out of my leg, I drifted to the edge. The pain was unbearable, and yet I remained conscious. I wasn&#39;t allowed to sleep on the island.
