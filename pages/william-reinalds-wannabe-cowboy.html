The sound of music repeated a thousand times play through my headphones, while I mop the floor of a liquid I don&#39;t, and don&#39;t want to, know. Two men stood behind me, arguing over some gambling dispute, until one said something slightly meaner. The second man recommend they take it outside, and in my peripheral I see him brush his hand over his revolver. The first man agrees, and push through the door, with the second close behind. Minutes later I hear a gun fire, and something hard hit the ground. Seconds later, both men return to gambling, the first laughing about how bad of a shot the second is.

What normally would be the highlight of a day was just another example of repetition. Those two men did it almost every day, they would argue, duel, one would die, then return to gambling like nothing happened. Just a cost of working at a Nexus. This nexus forced those to play into stereotypes and literary tropes, usually ones in the past. Since it was in Texas, cowboys were a staple of the area.

Once I&#39;d finish the mess caused either by an anomaly or average customers I exited the building, and walked with the street, to the county police station. Sunshine County Police station was another Foundation front, which I&#39;d only know since I worked there. Being a janitor for the most powerful organization in the world was an interesting thing to bring up, but it could only really be brought up to people who would look at him like he was expendable.

While I didn&#39;t mind my current life, I have always preferred it to be much more adventurous, like any one a level higher would have. If I could choose, a field agent would be my top choice. 

While I daydreamed of that impossibility I entered the &#34;police&#34; station.

&#34; &#39;ey William&#34; The man in the receptionist seat said, focusing on something on his computer.

&#34; Hey Smith,&#34; I replied, while heading further into the facility. The first floor was technically a police station, it held all the necessary requirements, which made emergency calls easy. 

For today I needed to collect some rock, which &#34;could hold the secret to explaining how nexuses work.&#34; Other then that tidbit, I knew little about what I was carrying, and simply took the case to the directed room. 

On my walk there, I grew a sense of unwellness, as if something was going to jump out at me at any moment. I looked behind me, and saw nothing but an empty hallway. I looked the way I was going, same lack of people. Site-83 was usually crawling with people, where was everyone? Then the lights turned off.

The lights quickly turned back on, but now in a deep red. The emergency sound blared from a nearby intercom, while I wildly looked left and right, trying to imagine where the closest emergency shelter is. While I scrambled to think of a plan, the smell of fire crept into my nostrils. Then the sound of screams, which got ever closer every second. I heard a low growl right behind me. I don&#39;t even think of what it is, and run as fast as I can, away from the noise. 

My sprint seemed to surprise the owner of the growl, as it paused for a second. Then the sound of a four legged animal running quickly started to gain on him, until he turned the corner, slamming right into the wall when he tried to squeeze by. The surprising pain to his side pushed him to the ground, and he dropped the container he was holding. The container shattered, the fragments spread across the ground. I try and pull myself up, but a sharp pain in my leg lightninged across my body. 

I breath in and try and think of something, and look across the floor, still hearing the pounding of paws against the floor. A light shines beneath a fragment of the container, which I pull myself towards. I push off the broken container, and collect the thing I was couriering across the site. I easily hold the small crystal in my hand. It looked like a light blue diamond, and seemed to vibrate with every second. I breath in, realizing death was only seconds away, as the pounding of paws got louder and louder. I hold the crystal close, feeling safer with it in my grasp. The beast is practically atop me, its breath feels more like ashes, and it growls at me. I try and pull myself up again, or distance myself, do anything to stop the inevitable, yet I can&#39;t move any of my body. I close my eyes, brace myself for death...



Nothing happens. The emergency alarm is no longer screaming in my ears, and the bright red light is nothing but a memory. I open my eyes. I&#39;m in an antique of a house, in what appears to be a living room. I&#39;m atop a rocking chair, and I see a fireplace ahead of me. I look around, and to my left, a second rocking chair is besides mine. Atop the chair is a man, jaw on the floor, eyes bulging out of his head. 

I realize that I might have just appeared near this man, and realize the danger it poses to the veil. 

&#34;How the hell?&#34; The man says, with the same facial expression. I stare back, and attempt to compose myself.

&#34;I, uh, I fell.&#34; I pause, realizing how stupid that sounds. I decide the truth sounds more like a lie, but I go for it despite that. &#34;I, sir, don&#39;t know.&#34;

We stare at each other for a few more moments. 

&#34;Do you want to go out and get some beer?&#34; The man said, already accepting a stranger popping into existence beside him.
------
I took the man up on the offer, as it seemed easier to amnesticize a drunk man then one sober. That, and the man seemed friendly enough. Now that he allowed his mind to calm a little, he was able to get a better view of the man. 

He was white, seemed to be in his early twenties. He had a stubble, one a teenager might brag about. He was also about the same size of a teen, about being average for a male. Personality wise he seemed like he took nothing less then the death of a loved one seriously, and seemed more than open to making new friends.

Something that confused me however, was the lack of cars. Sunshine County wasn&#39;t infested by cars, a large amount of the streets weren&#39;t paved, but it didn&#39;t shun them. Everyone also looked like they walked out of a western, which was still quite normal for the area. I then thought of a question, to guarantee nothing drastic happened when the crystal... wait. Where&#39;s the crystal? I padded myself feverously, and found a hard spot in one of my pockets. I took it out, and there it was. The crystal looked the same, so I placed it back where it was.   

&#34;So, what&#39;s your name, boy?&#34; The man said, looking at him. The dust kicked up almost made me cough.

&#34;William. Reinalds. William Reinalds.&#34; I said, not expecting the question. I attempted to ask him a question in turn, but he snuck in a comment.

&#34;Well there William. I, am the widely renowned James Pitt.&#34; He exclaimed, doing an exaggerated bow, which made me roll my eyes. The grin James had on since they left his house only grew, as they made the final steps to entering the tavern. 

&#34;James Pitt, I have a bit of an unusual question,&#34; I start, as I take a seat in the tavern. &#34;Who is the president?&#34;

&#34;Oh you stumped me there. I myself am not the most political, nor am I the best at keeping up with the news. I think the president is James Garfield.&#34; Pitt continued to himself, but I zoned out after he said the president, and did some math. Garfield was the 20th president, meaning 1881. I had somehow traveled back in time. My entire life is gone, I have no where to go. The foundation doesn&#39;t even exist...

 I took out the crystal and stared at it, feeling a panic attack breaking down my door and forcibly entering.

&#34;Oh, sorry if I was boring you. You don&#39;t seem to be from &#39;round here. Pretty small town, visitors aren&#39;t common.&#34; Pitt questioned, forcing me out of my head. 

I look up at him, thinking of a lie. &#34;Yeah, I uh, heard there was gold around here.&#34; 

Pitt&#39;s grin vanished, and he looked quite upset. &#34;Oh. sorry, but there ain&#39;t a lick of gold anywhere near this county. This town&#39;s hard to get to, sucks you wasted so much time getting here.&#34; 

I realize I should have thought of a better cover story, but I just run with it. &#34;Well, I guess I could stay? Any work I can find around here?&#34;

&#34;Well.&#34; He said, taking a swig of his beer. &#34;Sheriff has been needing help recently, there&#39;s a nasty gang running around, but I could take some help.&#34; 

&#34;What would the work look like?&#34; I ask, questioning where he got the beer from.

&#34;There&#39;s been rumors that someone is gravediggin&#39;&#39; from the graveyard, since every other mornin&#39; another grave has been dug and the bodies gone. Whoever&#39;s probably been stealing all around.&#34; He scooted closer to me. &#34;I say we steal right back, eh?&#34; He said, grinning. I think about my options, I have nothing on me other then the crystal and my clothes. However, I&#39;ve never done fieldwork before, and I have the smallest inkling on how to use a gun. Another thought inches into my brain. I have always wanted to work in the field.

&#34;I&#39;ll take you up on that, Pitt. Whatcha want from me?&#34; 

He smiled at me, and stood up. &#34;I assume you don&#39;t have a gun, do ya.&#34; I shake my head. &#34;Well lets get you un&#39; then!&#34; He said slapping my back. 

We both exit the tavern, and the sounds of bullets cause me to jump. I follow the sound with my eyes, seeing a small group entering the bank. 

&#34;Hey, what&#39;d I say. Nasty gang right there. Welp, nun of our business.&#34;

&#34;But their criminals,  shouldn&#39;t we do something?&#34;

&#34;The sheriff already knows. Probably dealing with them right now. Now, you want a gun right? I wanna catch that gravedigger.&#34;

I continue to stare at the bank, seeing unusual lights in the building. I shrug, and turn around to catch up to James.
