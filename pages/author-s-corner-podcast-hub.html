[[collapsible show=&#34;[+] Author’s Corner FAQ [+]&#34; hide=&#34;[-] Hide FAQ [-]&#34;]]
**What is Author’s Corner?**

Author’s Corner is an SCP Community podcast based around tales that are posted to the site, which usually get much less love than the standard SCP article. The show serves as a tale-highlighting platform, as well as a way for the community to get to know some of their favorite authors better. The show format consists of a greeting, the author reading their winning article aloud, and then a talkback.

**How do you decide what tales are on the show?**

Authors will submit their tales for a community vote that is held after a sufficient number of volunteered articles are submitted. The tale that is featured on the show is then voted on by the community.

**How do I vote for a tale/submit my tale for the show?**

There is a volunteer/voting form posted to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-4466551/new-podcast-author-s-corner this thread here] every time that a new vote/submission form is posted. Simply follow the instructions on the newest form.

**Can I volunteer tales that I have not written/by another author?**

No. You may only volunteer your own works, as we do not want a tale winning the community vote only to learn the author is not comfortable appearing on a podcast/is no longer active.

**What do I do if I win?**

I, [[*user taylor_itkin]], will contact you via the easiest contact method you have submitted along with your volunteered article (it will be on the volunteer form). From there, we will collaborate to set a date and time for the recording.

**When and where do you record, and can I listen in?**

We record our podcast via [https://discord.gg/6NS4tGH Discord on our server], and yes, you can listen in! We record live, and always post the date and time of the recording to the forum thread in advance, as well as announcements in the discord server.

**How can I be a part of the podcast?**

Aside from volunteering to appear on the show, you can submit questions for the authors in advance of the recording with a form that will also be posted to the forum thread. In addition, because we record live, there are rooms on the Discord server for asking questions live.

**How can I stay up to date on the podcast episodes?**

Episodes will be posted directly to [https://www.djkakt.us/authors-corner/ this website], as well as an announcement in the forum thread and being posted to this page.

**Can I volunteer an SCP article or a GOI format for a reading?**

No to SCP articles, yes to GOI formats. The goal of Author’s Corner is to bring more attention to the side of the site that gets less attention than others - GOI formats and tales get much less attention than SCP articles on a regular basis. Ultimately, it is up to the community vote to decide what will appear on the show, but nothing is stopping you from volunteering a GOI format.

**I have more questions, what do I do?**

Ask them in the forum thread, Discord server, or hit me up through Wikidot PM or the IRC.
