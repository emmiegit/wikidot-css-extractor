You´re definitely lost. You´ve been in the Sea of Words, on your metaphorical ship (You´re not quite sure what it looks like, even though you´ve been on it for a while now), and you´re lost. You think about those you´ve left behind to go on this voyage, but their words of warning melt into the void of forgetfulness. You see something floating ahead of you- some sort of file cabinet. It catches onto your anchor, as if it was magnetized, and you rush down to take it off. You heave it on board- it´s not very heavy- and look inside.

[[tab Mr. E´s Stories]]

A group of documents lay dusty and mildewed in this one. Someone´s written on the pages.

[https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/the-third-death-of-james-brooklyn James Brooklyn: A Thought] {{Baby´s first entry! Definitely an experiment of a story. Let´s hope my future creations learn from its mistakes.}}

[https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/jeremy-s-paradox-of-perspective Jeremy´s Paradox of Perspective] {{did better than I thought it would. I thank the old gods for discussion forums.}}

[https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/a-glisten-in-the-heavens-whatever-you-need-it-to-be A Glisten in the Heavens: Whatever You Need It To Be] {{did worse than I thought it would. Don´t worry, my child, I am still proud of you.}}

[[tab Cole Pitolinsur Ection´s Box of Stuff]]

//This cabinet is filled with a few items- a shirt in a sickeningly rich shade of blue, a box of 2.5-strength clarinet reeds, a MUNI bus ticket, and a pansexual flag. You´ve no idea what they mean. But there´s also a slip of paper!//

{{Hi there! I´m Cole, Mr. Ection, whatever you need to call me. In the real world, I am a high school student in California, USA. Nothing else needs to be said right now. Until next time. Close the drawer on your way out.}}
