This page is a collaborative resource defining terms commonly used on the site or in the community. While erring on the side of inclusion and open to contributions from any site member, new terms should not be added to this page unless they&#39;ve been used in published articles on the site more than once. While you don&#39;t have to cite sources, remember that links to articles that go into more detail can be very useful to people unfamiliar with specific terms. An important caveat is that these terms may not always be used consistently, that&#39;s just inevitable when we have so many different canons and alternate interpretations on the site.

Terms defined elsewhere ([[[object classes]]], [[[personnel-and-character-dossier|characters]]], [[[locations-of-interest|specific locations]]], [[[groups of interest]]]) are omitted from this list to avoid redundancy. If you&#39;re not sure whether a term warrants inclusion, want to clarify a proposed definition, or think a definition already on this page should be amended, post in the discussion thread for this page to get feedback first. Feel free to comment on other people&#39;s suggestions and additions, if you think you have something useful to add!

[[toc]]

+ In-Universe Terms
Terms that may be used in SCP articles, tales and GoI formats.

++ Article Format
Listed by typical order of appearance in an SCP article.
* **Item #** -- The numeric identifier for the SCP. Note that the formal name of an SCP is always &#34;SCP-####&#34;, and not its number alone (&#34;SCP-173&#34;, not &#34;173&#34;), although the number on its own is often used informally.
* **[[[object-classes|Object Class]]]** -- A system of categorization based on the difficulty of containing the entity or object. See the [[[Object Classes]]] guide for more information, and definitions of the most commonly used object classes (Safe, Euclid, Keter), as well as some less commonly used object classes (including Thaumiel, Neutralized and Apollyon). [[[esoteric-classes-complete-list| More esoteric object classes]]] may replace these, and supplementary classification systems may be used (such as adding a **[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/niveaux-de-menace-des-objets-scp Threat Level]**, or using the [[[anomaly-classification-system-guide| Anomaly Classification System]]], which replaces &#34;Object Class&#34; with &#34;Containment Class&#34;).
* **Special Containment Procedures** (**SCP**) -- Instructions to be followed to keep the entity or object contained. May be referred to informally as &#34;conprocs&#34;.
* **Description** -- The section of an SCP article that explains in a clear and concise way what the entity or object does, and why it is contained. The description can be supplemented by one or more addenda, but you should be able to understand the basic function through the Description alone.
* **Addendum** -- (//Plural: addenda//) A section of an SCP article that either expands on specific aspects of the primary Description, shows the progression of information over time, or otherwise provides additional insight that does not fit into the Description block. Addenda can be posted on the main page or in separate **[[[incident-reports-eye-witness-interviews-and-personal-logs| supplement]]]** pages, and can include [/system:page-tags/tag/experiment Experiment Logs], [/system:page-tags/tag/exploration Exploration Logs], [/system:page-tags/tag/incident Incident Reports] or [/system:page-tags/tag/interview Interviews].

++ Foundation Terminology
Other terms used in Foundation documents to describe their own personnel, facilities and containment procedures.
* **[[[o5-command-dossier| The Administrator]]]** -- Mysterious figure in-universe, may (or may not) have been the Founder of the SCP Foundation. Possibly a member of the **O5 Council**, possibly the overall leader of the Foundation.
* **[[[personnel-and-character-dossier| agent]]]** -- An undercover Foundation field agent, typically capitalized when used as a title (e.g. Agent Smith). Note that not all field personnel employed by the Foundation are necessarily &#34;agents&#34; in this sense, nor do all such personnel have the title &#34;Agent&#34;. See also: **containment team**, **response team**, **Mobile Task Force**, and **researcher**.
* **[[[log-of-anomalous-items| Anomalous Item]]]**/**Anomalous Object** (**AO**) -- An object with **anomalous** properties too minor to warrant **Special Containment Procedures** or further research.
* **anomaly**/**anomalous** -- Foundation term for the objects they contain and research. Generally defined as anything that cannot be explained by current scientific knowledge. See also **paranormal** and **anahuman**.
* **Area** -- A type of [[[secure-facilities-locations#area| Foundation Facility]]] completely unknown to the public.
* **containment breach** -- Term used when an SCP object escapes containment. Could involve physically breaking out of a **containment chamber**, could also mean spread of knowledge about it outside of the Foundation.
* **containment chamber** -- A room dedicated to the containment of an SCP object.
* **containment team** -- Field personnel specializing in recovering or retrieving anomalous objects or entities. Members may or may not be field agents as well, but usually have a different title, such as &#34;Containment Specialist&#34;. See also **agent**, **response team**.
* **[DATA EXPUNGED]** -- One of the two types of censorship used on the site, something that is &#34;expunged&#34; has been permanently deleted from all records, typically because the information poses a hazard in and of itself, e.g. if it&#39;s a **memetic** hazard. See also **[REDACTED]**.
* **D Class** -- Foundation employees deemed expendable if necessary for testing or containment. See the [[[Security Clearance Levels]]] guide for more information, as well as the relevant [[[ethics-committee-class-d-housing-regulations|Ethics Committee Regulations]]]. 
* **[[[departments| department]]]** -- Organisations within the Foundation that specialize in a specific task, discipline or field.
* **[[[personnel-and-character-dossier| director]]]** -- The head of a Foundation **Facility** or **Department**. Typically capitalised when used as a title (e.g. Director Jones).
* **Disruption Class** -- Part of the [[[anomaly-classification-system-guide| Anomaly Classification System]]], the Disruption Class refers to an anomaly&#39;s ability to disturb the status quo or break **the Veil** if uncontained. In ascending order, these are Dark, Vlam, Keneq, Ekhi and Amida.
* **[[[scp-ex|Explained]]]** (**EX**) -- A sub-class of SCP object that has either been debunked as a hoax, sufficiently understood so as to be normal scientific knowledge, or so widely disseminated that containment is no longer possible.
* **[[[log-of-extranormal-events| Extranormal Events]]]** -- Anomalous events that occurred too briefly to be contained.
* **[[[secure-facilities-locations|Facility]]]** -- A generic term used to refer to both **[[[secure-facilities-locations#site| Sites]]]** and **[[[secure-facilities-locations#area| Areas]]]**.
* **The Foundation** -- A secret organization that contains **anomalous** objects, entities, and phenomena through the creation of Special Containment Procedures. Usually just &#34;The Foundation&#34;, only rarely referred to as the &#34;SCP Foundation&#34; in-universe.
* **[[[locations-of-interest#free-port| Free Port]]]** -- A larger and more formally recognised type of **[[[nexus-series| Nexus]]]**, an area that is inherently anomalous and entirely behind the **Veil**. This means that there is no need to try to conceal the existence of the **anomalous** from the people who live there, since they all already know.
* **[[[Groups of Interest]]]** (**GoI**) -- A Group of Interest is an organsiation other than the Foundation that is aware of the anomalous. 
* **[[[k-class-complete-list| K-Class Scenario/K-Class Event]]]** -- Hypothetical situations with drastic effects on normality or reality. The most well-known K-Class Event, the XK-Class Event, typically denotes a catastrophic event resulting in the destruction of human society, if not the entire human species, but various other scenarios have their own designations, used with varying consistency across different articles.
* **[[[Locations of Interest]]]** (**LoI**) -- A Location of Interest is an area with anomalous properties, often inhabited by a permanent community and requiring a more diplomatic approach to their containment. See also **Unexplained Location**, **Nexus** and **Free Port**.
* **[[[task-forces|Mobile Task Force]]]** -- A Mobile Task Force (or MTF for short) is a highly-trained and specialized team that is deployed to various locations as needed to deal with specialized threats or conditions. Mobile Task Forces are designated by a Greek letter and a number (e.g. &#34;MTF Alpha-7&#34;, &#34;MTF Omega-15&#34;) and may have a nickname attached, similar to many real-life military units. MTFs are the elite personnel of the Foundation, and run the gamut from highly experienced field researchers to combat-hardened troops.
* **[[[locations-of-interest#nexus| Nexus]]]** -- An actively anomalous location supporting a permanent community. Originally defined and listed [[[nexus-series|here]]].
* **[[[o5-command-dossier| O5 Council]]]** (**O5**) -- short for the &#34;Council of Observers, Level 5&#34; or the &#34;Overseer Level 5 Council&#34;. The highest authority in the Foundation, a council of 12 or 13 individuals who have the power to authorize or veto any action taken by the Foundation as a whole. O5 Council members are only known by their numbers (O5-1 through O5-13), are rarely involved in day-to-day Foundation activities, and are typically not allowed to contact any SCP objects directly for fear of contamination. Note that it&#39;s a capital letter &#34;o&#34;, not the number zero.
* **[[[personnel-and-character-dossier| Person of Interest]]]** (**PoI**) -- An individual that the **Foundation** is investigating or observing due to their involvement with the anomalous. May have anomalous abilities, have had contact with an **SCP object** or be a member of a **Group of Interest**. 
* **[REDACTED]** -- One of the two types of censorship used on the site. Something that is &#34;redacted&#34; is withheld from the article because the reader is not cleared to see the information, but would be made available to someone else with a higher **Security Clearance Level** or on a need-to-know basis. See also **[DATA EXPUNGED]**.
* **[[[personnel-and-character-dossier| researcher]]]** -- A broad term for anyone involved in research and development at the Foundation - they may be referred to as a Researcher, Technician, Doctor or Professor, depending on their qualifications and specialty. Researchers can be involved in anything from figuring out how an anomalous object or entity functions to developing better materials and containment procedures. Field researchers may also accompany containment teams to assess the nature of uncontained anomalies.
* **response team** -- A heavily armed team trained to deal with security or containment breaches, typically at a secure Foundation site. Response team members are also sent into the field to escort containment teams when dealing with highly hostile or dangerous objects or entities, or when enemy [[[Groups of Interest]]] are involved. 
* **Risk Class** -- Part of the [[[anomaly-classification-system-guide| Anomaly Classification System]]], the Risk Class refers to the severity of an anomaly&#39;s effects on an individual person, and how easily one can recover from it. In ascending order, these are Notice, Caution, Warning, Danger and Critical.
* **SCiPNET** -- The Foundation&#39;s intranet and inter-site database, used to sending emails between employees and for accessing SCP files and other documents.
* **SCP** -- An [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialism initialism] for &#34;Special Containment Procedures&#34;, and used informally as a short-form of &#34;SCP article&#34;, as in, &#34;I wrote three SCPs yesterday&#34;. SCP objects or entities are not formally referred to as &#34;an SCP&#34; or &#34;the SCP&#34; in-universe, although characters might do so informally, even using casual pronunciations like &#34;scip&#34; or &#34;skip&#34;. Note that &#34;SCP&#34; is //not// an initialism for &#34;Secure, Contain, Protect&#34;; the motto of the Foundation is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym backronym] derived from &#34;SCP&#34;.
* **SCP object**/**SCP entity** -- An anomaly assigned its own **Special Containment Procedures**. May also be referred to as [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-56 Special Containment Projects (SCPs).]
* **[[[security-clearance-levels| Security Clearance Level]]]** -- Specifies the information that a Foundation employee is authorized to know, ranging from 1 (very limited) to 5 (beyond top secret).
* **Site** -- A type of [[[secure-facilities-locations#site| Foundation Facility]]] disguised behind a mundane front (e.g. as a corporation or government office).
* **Species of Interest** (**SoI**) -- Non-human species with anomalous properties. 
* **[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/niveaux-de-menace-des-objets-scp Threat Level]** -- A complimentary system to the object classes, assigning each anomaly a color code based on the danger it would pose if containment was breached. The threat levels, in ascending order, are White, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red and Black.
* **Undesignated Anomaly** (**UA**) -- An anomalous entity that has not yet been placed into containment. Temporary designation, prior to full documentation as an SCP object.  
* **[[[log-of-unexplained-locations| Unexplained Location]]]** -- A specific place where anomalous phenomena too minor to be assigned **Special Containment Procedures** occur. See also **Locations of Interest**, as well as **Nexus** and **Free Port** for inhabited anomalous locations.

++ Anomalous Science
Terms used by the Foundation and by other groups to describe and categorise the anomalous.
* **acroamatic abatement** -- The processing of waste products and esoteric substance from anomalies into non-anomalous industrial effluent. See [[[acroamatic-abatement|Everything You Need to Know About Acroamatic Abatement But Were Too Confused by the Name to Ask]]] for an elaboration.
* **Akiva Radiation** -- Radiation linked to prayer and divine intervention, possible to measure and quantify in centiAkiva. A place with high levels of Akiva radiation has been visited or touched by a god, while a place with low Akiva radiation may be considered forgotten or forsaken by the gods. Named after a Jewish scholar and religious leader, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi_Akiva Rabbi Akiva].
* **anahuman**/**parahuman**/**superhuman** -- A human being with anomalous properties or abilities.
* **[/system:page-tags/tag/antimemetic antimemetic]** -- Antimemes (also known as counterconcepts) are ideas which, by their intrinsic nature, discourage or prevent people from spreading them. The Foundation has an [[[antimemetics-division-hub| Antimemetics Division]]] investigating and containing anomalous antimemes.
* **[[[personnel-and-character-dossier| Apex Tier Pluripotent Entity]]]** -- An incredibly powerful being, possibly omnipotent. Generally used as a clinical term for a god (although not all divine beings will be &#34;Apex Tier&#34;), alongside alternative terms like **pistiphage**.
* **Aspect Radiation (ARad)** -- **EVE** emissions intense enough to alter reality - the basis of **thaumatology**.
* **backlash** -- Random alterations to reality caused as a side-effect of **thaumaturgy**.
* **bozomorphic** — Clinical term for anomalous entities resembling clowns. See the [[[dread-circuses-hub|Dread &amp; Circuses Hub]]] for a summary of certain types of bozomorphic entities.
* **bureaucratohazards** -- A sub-class of **semiohazards** that affect bureaucratic systems, making certain entities not guilty despite committing crimes or violating rules.
* **carnomancy**/**fleshcrafting** -- anomalous techniques for altering and reshaping the body, most frequently practiced by followers of [[[sarkicism-hub| Sarkicism]]].
* **Cognitive Resistance Value** -- A measurement of the mental fortitude and resistance of an individual to mind-affecting anomalies, particularly those that are **memetic**.
* **[/system:page-tags/tag/cognitohazard cognitohazard]** -- A term used to refer to objects that are dangerous to perceive. This could occur through any or all of the human senses, including sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch. Differs from an **infohazard** in that simply being informed about the **cognitohazard** has no anomalous effect. See also **memetics**.
* **[/system:page-tags/tag/ectoentropic ectoentropic]** -- Entities or objects that produce energy or matter in an unexplained way, in apparent violation of the First and Second [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics Laws of Thermodynamics] - energy (which includes matter) cannot be created, and entropy (the disorder of a system) must always increase over time.
* **Elan-Vital Energy** (**EVE**) -- Mysterious energy emitted from living beings and sapient anomalies that can power **thaumatology**. See [[[goc-supplemental-arad|this lecture]]] for more information. May be referred to by alternative terms, such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aura_(paranormal) Aura], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mana Mana],  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgone Orgone] or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi Qi (Chi/Ki)].
* **essophysics** -- The scientific study of the physical embodiments or manifestations of abstract concepts.
* **extradimensional**/**extra-reality** -- Existing in or originating from an alternate reality. 
* **hemovore** -- Clinical term for a vampire.
* **Hume** -- A unit used to measure the strength or amount of reality in an area. See the [[[and-this-one-explains-humes|FAQ]]] for more information. Named for the philosopher [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume David Hume].
* **infoallergenic** -- An uncommon class of infohazard, capable of exhibiting both **memetic** and **antimemetic** properties. See also **pretermemetic**.
* **[/system:page-tags/tag/infohazard infohazard]** -- A term used to refer to objects that have an anomalous effect whenever they are referred to or described. Differs from a **cognitohazard** in that cognitohazards require the anomalous phenomenon to be directly perceived, whereas infohazards may be spread indirectly, simply through people telling each other about them. Because of this, the effects of **infohazards** are often **memetic**. See [[[memetics-and-infohazards-division-orientation| this orientation]]] for more information.
* **kinetohazard**/**kinetoglyphs** -- anomalous mental and physical effects that occur when an entity performs specific gestures and movements.
* **Large-Scale Aggressor** (**LSA**) -- Clinical term for a giant monster.
* **[/system:page-tags/tag/memetic memetic]** -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme Memes] are the basic units of culture, ideas or behaviours that can be transmitted to others through communication or imitation. In the context of the Foundation, memetic effects are a sub-class of **cognitohazards** and **infohazards** that deal with the transfer of information. Ideas and concepts with anomalous memetic properties can spread much more effectively than non-anomalous memes, and may have anomalous effects on anyone exposed to them. Creators and users of anomalous memetic effects are referred to as memeticists. See [[[Understanding Memetics]]] and [[[memetics-and-infohazards-division-orientation| this orientation]]] for more information.
* **[/system:page-tags/tag/metamorphic metamorphic]**/**polymorphic** -- Clinical term for shapeshifters, entities that alter their own form or appearance.

* **Noosphere** --  The realm of human thought, encompassing dreams, concepts and ideas. 
* **ontokinesis**/**ontokinetic** -- Clinical term for **reality bending**.
* **paranormal**/**paranatural**/**preternatural** -- alternative terms used to describe phenomena that the Foundation categorises as **anomalous**. Anomalous phenomena may also be referred to as occult, supernatural or transmundane.
* **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/pataphysics-dept pataphysics]**/**&#39;pataphysics** -- The scientific study of fictional narratives and their effect on reality. Includes the study of the fictional SCP universe itself by characters that are part of it.
* **psionics** -- The creation of supernatural phenomena solely through the power of the mind, including telepathy, telekinesis, precognition and clairvoyance. The scientific study of psionics may be known as parapsychology or as psychotronics, the later term mostly being used in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Individuals with psionic abilities may be known as psions, psychics, psykers, mentalists or espers. See [[[psi-guide-1| this lecture]]] for more information.
* **[/system:page-tags/tag/pattern-screamer Pattern Screamer]** -- Consciousnesses embedded within the fabric of reality. These entities do not exist, although they may have existed at some point in the past, and may be brought into existence if perceived. Also known as [[[pattern-dwellers-an-expose| Pattern Dwellers]]].
* **pistiphage** -- An entity that feeds on faith, deriving sustenance and power from belief and worship. Often used as a clinical term for a god, a pistiphage may also be a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa Tulpa] or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egregore Egregore], only existing because people believe in it.  An **Apex Tier Pluripotent Entity** may or may not also be a pistiphage.
* **pretermemetic** -- Information that is selectively **memetic** or **anti-memetic** depending on the nature of the recipients or circumstances. Used by groups such as [[[dread-circuses-hub| Herman Fuller&#39;s Circus of the Disquieting]]] to advertise without attracting the attention of organisations like the Foundation. See also **infoallergenic**.
* **[/system:page-tags/tag/reality-bending reality bending]**/**reality warping** -- The anomalous ability to alter reality. May be referred to as **ontokinesis** or magic, although **thaumatology** is generally regarded as something separate. Humanoid reality benders may be referred to as &#34;Type Greens&#34; using [[[goc-supplemental-threat-entities| Global Occult Coalition terminology]]], or as [[[grasp-on-reality| &#34;bixbies&#34;]]], &#34;ontokineticists&#34;, [[[goc-supplemental-thaumatology| &#34;Outside Observers&#34;]]] or [[[grant-request-for-the-manufacture-of-devices-to-regulate|&#34;Objective-Reality Independent persons&#34;]]]. See [[[and-this-one-explains-humes|this FAQ]]], [[[clef101|this orientation]]] and [[[what-we-know-so-far-answering-the-question-of-what-how-and-w| this document]]] for more information.
* **semiontological anomaly**/**semiohazard** -- Anomalies that disrupt the **semiosphere** to create universal axioms that should not be possible.
* **semiosphere** -- The medium through which information about reality travels before it is perceived or measured.
* **spectral entity** -- Clinical term for a [system:page-tags/tag/ghost ghost], spectre or spirit. May also be referred to as a posthumous entity, eidomorph or an ectomorph (an entity made from ectoplasm). See [[[anatomy-of-a-specter| this document]]] for more information.
*  **spectremetry** -- The scientific study of **spectral entities.**
* **[/system:page-tags/tag/surrealistics-dept surrealistics]** -- The scientific study of anomalies too incomprehensible or bizarre to understand, except through illogical thought and the use of **agnostics.** 
* **Tartarean Resonance Energy** (**TRE**) -- Radiation naturally produced by demonic entities. Named for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus Tartarus], the part of the Greek Underworld where monsters and sinners were imprisoned.
* **Tartarean-Class Demonic Entity**/**Tartarean Entity** -- Clinical term for a demon. See the [[[undervegas-hub|Undervegas Hub]]] for a summary of certain classes of Tartarean Entities.
* **thaumatology** -- The scientific study of **thaumaturgy**, a term meaning &#34;wonder-working&#34; and referring to magic, miracles and the occult. Users of magic can be referred to as Thaumatologists, Thaumaturges or &#34;Type Blues&#34; in [[[goc-supplemental-threat-entities| Global Occult Coalition terminology]]], although more archaic terms like &#34;wizard&#34;, &#34;sorcerer&#34; and &#34;mage&#34; may still be used. When considered as distinct from **reality bending**, the phenomena studied by thaumatology generally follow more predictable rules and limitations. See [[[goc-supplemental-thaumatology| this lecture]]], [[[another-goddamn-magic-system| this orientation]]] and [[[sistema-taumaturgico|this document]]] for more information. 
* **tychekinesis** -- Clinical term for probability manipulation, named for the Greek goddess of fate and fortune, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyche Tyche].
* **Way** -- A anomalous connection between two locations, enabling rapid travel between them regardless of distance.

++ Anomalous Technologies
Advanced technologies existing within the Foundation setting.
* **agnostics** -- Substances that makes consumers more open to otherwise incomprehensible anomalous phenomena by altering their thought-patterns to become more illogical. See also **surrealistics**.
* **amnestic** -- Drugs, procedures, or devices that induce memory loss when administered to an individual. While sedatives with amnestic properties are not unknown to medical science, the Foundation&#39;s amnestics have much greater potency and specificity, enabling them to make civilian witnesses forget about anomalous activity. Although the exact details vary, see the [[[amnestic-orientation-manual| Amnestic Use Guide]]] and the [[[Updated Amnestics Guide]]] for more information. 
* **apportation** -- Teleportation through **thaumaturgy**.
* **Artificially Intelligent Conscript** (**AIC**) -- An artificial intelligence created and employed by the Foundation&#39;s [[[aiad-homescreen| Artificial Intelligence Applications Division]]].
* **beryllium bronze** -- A metallic alloy frequently used in anomalous devices.
* **Bright/Zartion Hominid Replicator** -- A device capable of creating non-anomalous humans from raw materials. Individuals can be created at any age, and can be implanted with memories and skills. Essential to the function of [[[SCP-2000]]], may also be used to create **[[[D-2000| D Class]]]** personnel, and potentially other Foundation employees.
* **countermeme**/**memetic inoculation** -- An **memetic** concept, a counter-meme protects against or reverses the effects of an anomalous meme.
* **Dark Web** -- A cloud computing service operated by [[[marshall-carter-and-dark-hub| Marshal, Carter and Dark]]] as a [[[the-dark-web-dke79-o2rg5-4jlw6 | subscription service]]], enabling access to anomalous applications via ordinary computers. Used by the anomalous community to access services such as **Void**.

* **eigenweapon** -- An anomalous weapon of mass destruction, capable of causing widespread devastation and/or massive loss of life. See [[[deus-vulture| this tale]]] for one history of eigenweapon development. Terms like eigenmachine may be used for similar devices intended for purposes other than destruction.
* **Everhart Resonator** -- A device for converting electrical energy into **EVE**, in order to power **thaumatology**. 
* **Geas** -- The use of memetic agents to force a person to obey a set of rules or guidelines. The name comes from Irish mythology, where a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geas Geas] is a magically enforced prohibition against certain actions.
* **gnostics** -- The opposite of an **agnostic**, gnostics make one more certain and sure of things, although this does not necessarily make them correct. 
* **Kant Counter** - Instrument used to measure the **Hume** level of a location, that is, the amount of reality that is present. See [[[and-this-one-explains-humes|this FAQ]]] for more information. Named for the philosopher [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant Immanuel Kant].

May function through the use of the [[[scp-4231| captured reality benders]]], although there are [[[scp-4065| alternative explanations]]] for how they work. See [[[and-this-one-explains-humes| this FAQ]]] and [[[grant-request-for-the-manufacture-of-devices-to-regulate| this Grant Request]]] for more information, and [[[reach-s-blueprint-folder| this page]]] for blueprints.

++ Anomalous Culture
Terms used to describe events and practices involving anomalous individuals and communities.

* **anart** -- Short for Anomalous Art. This can be artwork with anomalous properties, or the use of the anomalous for the purpose of artistic expression. See [[[a-study-of-anomalous-art| this document]]] and [[[anart-lecture| this lecture]]] for further analysis.

The dates and events of the preceding six Occult Wars are not as widely agreed upon.
* **paracrime** -- Illegal paranormal activity, investigated by organisations such as the FBI&#39;s [[[unusual-incidents-unit-hub|Unusual Incidents Unit]]], and punished by imprisonment in institutions such as [[[Paramax]]].

++ Community Terminology
* **clinical term**/**clinical terminology** -- Using scientific (or pseudoscientific) words and phrasing instead of more commonly used equivalents and colloquial language - many examples are listed in the Anomalous Science section! This is used to make SCP files read more like a real scientific document - in-universe, Foundation employees would use these terms because they&#39;re more precise and professional than more widely used synonyms. See the [[[Clinical vs Complex]]] and [[[clinical-tone-declassified|Clinical Tone: Declassified]]] essays for more information on getting this right.
* **cold-post** -- A page submitted directly to the site without any kind of review. Can be well received, but the term is usually used in a derogatory manner, referring to work posted by newer members that would have really benefited from receiving feedback and critique on the **draft**.
* **[[[format-screw-hub| format screw]]]** -- A term for SCP articles that intentionally violate some aspect of the standard SCP format or framework, generally because the SCP itself affects the documentation.
* **headcanon** -- Refers to individual interpretations of inconsistent, ambiguous or non-existent elements of **canon** - people use this term to describe how they imagine aspects of the Foundation universe, while recognizing that it&#39;s only one interpretation. A good example of this would be the exact strengths of the various classes of amnestics, or the precise nature of various K-class Events.
* **hook** -- The aspect of your article or tale that catches your reader&#39;s attention and makes them want to keep reading until the end. A hook has to inspire some sort of curiosity or emotion in your reader; it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be at the very beginning of your article, but it does have to be early enough to make a difference. A hook can also be the aspect of the article or tale that keeps a reader interested after they&#39;re done reading; this can take the form of an interesting revelation or twist ending, and tends to be closer to the end of the writing.
* **Keter duty** -- In-universe threats to demote personnel to Class D or otherwise assigning them to dangerous Keter-class objects as a form of punishment. Considered a type of **lolFoundation**.
* **locked box test** -- An informal thought exercise often used to determine what Object Class on an object or entity ought to have. It is explained as such:
 * //If it&#39;s locked in a box indefinitely and nothing bad will happen, it&#39;s probably **Safe**-class.//
 * //If it&#39;s locked in a box and we have no idea what might happen, it&#39;s probably **Euclid**-class.//
 * //If it&#39;s locked into a box and eventually all hell will break loose, it&#39;s probably **Keter**-class.//
 * //If it// is //the box, then it is probably **Thaumiel** class.//
* **lolFoundation** -- Additions to an SCP article that imply seriously unprofessional conduct among Foundation personnel, such as reckless misuse of dangerous anomalous objects, as well as threats of punishment for such behavior. While generally considered to be too unprofessional for a serious research organization, there is still [[[lolfoundation-hub-page| a place for it]]] on the site.
 * **NeololFoundation** — Refers to the shift of more humorous and light-hearted, as well as narrative- and character-based, articles in the modern days of the SCP Wiki. A reimagining of **lolFoundation**.
* **[[[spc-hub|SPC]]]** -- The Shark Punching Center. A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym backronym] created to make fun of people who misspell &#34;SCP&#34; as &#34;SPC&#34; (e.g. &#34;I like the idea, but what does the Shark Punching Center have to do with it?&#34;), subsequently turned into a **Group of Interest**.
* **Total Winner** -- Refers to articles that have reached a rating of +100 under 24 hours.
