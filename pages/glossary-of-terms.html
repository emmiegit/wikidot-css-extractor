The intention of this page was to create a collaborative resource to define terms commonly used on the site or in the community. While erring on the side of inclusion and open to contributions from any site member, new terms should not be added to this page unless they&#39;ve been used on the site by multiple people. While you don&#39;t have to cite sources, remember that links to articles that go into more detail can be very useful to people unfamiliar with specific terms.

Terms defined elsewhere (object classes, characters, locations, groups of interest) are omitted from this list to avoid redundancy. If you&#39;re not sure whether a term warrants inclusion, want to clarify a proposed definition, or think a definition already on this page should be amended, post in the discussion thread for this page to get feedback first. Feel free to comment on other people&#39;s suggestions and additions, if you think you have something useful to add!

[[toc]]

+ In Universe Terms
Terms that may be used in SCP articles, tales and GoI formats.

++ Article Format
Listed by typical order of appearance in an SCP article.
* **Item #** -- The numeric identifier for the SCP. Note that the formal name of an SCP is always &#34;SCP-####&#34;, and not its number alone (&#34;SCP-173&#34;, not &#34;173&#34;), although the number on its own is often used informally.
* **Object Class** -- A system of categorization based roughly on the difficulty of containing the entity or object. See the [[[Object Classes]]] guide for more information, and definitions of the most commonly used object classes (Safe, Euclid, Keter). Alternative classification systems or more esoteric object classes may sometimes be used.
* **Special Containment Procedures** (**SCP**) -- Instructions to be followed to keep the entity or object contained. May be referred to informally as &#34;conprocs&#34;.
* **Description** -- The section of an SCP article that explains in a clear and concise way what the entity or object does, and why it is contained. The basic description can be enhanced by one or more addenda, but you should be able to understand its basic function through the Description alone.
* **Addendum** -- (//Plural: addenda//) A section of an SCP article that either expands on specific aspects of the primary Description, shows a progression of information over time, or otherwise provides additional insight that does not fit into the Description block. Addenda can be posted on the main page or in separate **[[[incident-reports-eye-witness-interviews-and-personal-logs| supplement]]]** pages, and can include [/system:page-tags/tag/experiment Experiment Logs], [/system:page-tags/tag/exploration Exploration Logs], [/system:page-tags/tag/incident Incident Reports] or [/system:page-tags/tag/interview Interviews].

++ Foundation Terminology
Other terms used by the Foundation (the fictional organisation).
* **[[[o5-command-dossier| The Administrator]]]** -- Mysterious figure in-universe, may (or may not) have been the Founder of the SCP Foundation. Possibly a member of the **O5 Council**, possibly the overall leader of the Foundation.
* **[[[personnel-and-character-dossier| agent]]]** -- An undercover Foundation field agent, typically capitalized when used as a title (e.g. Agent Smith). Note that not all field personnel employed by the Foundation are necessarily &#34;agents&#34; in this sense, nor do all such personnel have the title &#34;Agent&#34;. See also: **containment team**, **response team**, **Mobile Task Force**, and **researcher**.
* **[[[log-of-anomalous-items| Anomalous Item]]]** -- An object with **anomalous** properties too minor to warrant **Special Containment Procedures** or further research.
* **anomaly**/**anomalous** -- Foundation term for the objects they contain and research. 
* **Area** -- A type of [[[secure-facilities-locations| Foundation Facility]]] completely unknown to the public.
* **containment breach** -- Term used when an SCP object escapes containment. Could involve physically breaking out of a **containment chamber**, could also mean spread of knowledge about it outside of the Foundation.
* **containment chamber** -- A room dedicated to the containment of an SCP object.
* **containment team** -- Field personnel specializing in recovering or retrieving anomalous objects or entities. Members may or may not be field agents as well, but usually have a different title, such as &#34;Containment Specialist&#34;. See also **agent**, **response team**.
* **[DATA EXPUNGED]** -- One of the two types of censorship used on the site, something that is &#34;expunged&#34; has been permanently deleted from all records, typically because the information poses a hazard in and of itself, e.g. if it&#39;s a **memetic** hazard. Should always be in all-caps with square brackets. See also **[REDACTED]**.
* **D Class** -- Foundation employees deemed expendable if necessary for testing or containment. See the [[[Security Clearance Levels]]] guide for more information.
* **[[[decom-dept-hub| Decommissioned]]]** (**D**) -- An anomalous object that has been intentionally destroyed.  See the [[[Object Classes]]] guide for more information. 
* **[[[departments-complete-list| department]]]** -- Organisations within the Foundation that specialize in a specific task, discipline or field.
* **[[[personnel-and-character-dossier| director]]]** -- The head of a Foundation **Facility** or **Department**. Typically capitalised when used as a title (e.g. Director Jones).
* **[[[scp-ex|Explained]]]** (**EX**) -- A sub-class of SCP object that has either been debunked as a hoax, sufficiently understood so as to be normal scientific knowledge, or so widely disseminated that containment is no longer possible.
* **[[[log-of-extranormal-events| Extranormal Events]]]** -- Anomalous events that occurred too briefly to be contained.
* **Facility** -- A generic term used to refer to both **[[[secure-facilities-locations| Sites]]]** and **[[[secure-facilities-locations| Areas]]]**.
* **The Foundation** -- A secret organization that contains anomalous or supernatural objects, entities, and phenomena through the creation of Special Containment Procedures. Usually just &#34;The Foundation&#34;, only rarely referred to as the &#34;SCP Foundation&#34; in-universe.
* **[[[Groups of Interest]]]** (**GoI**) -- Organisations other than the Foundation that are aware of the anomalous. 
* **[[[k-class-complete-list| K-Class Scenario]]]** -- Hypothetical situations with drastic effects on normality or reality. The most well-known K-Class Event, the XK-Class Event, typically denotes a catastrophic event resulting in the destruction of human society, if not the entire human species.
* **Location of Interest** -- A location with known or suspected anomalous properties. See also **Unexplained Location**, **Nexus** and **Freeport**.
* **[[[task-forces|Mobile Task Force]]]** -- A Mobile Task Force (or MTF for short) is a highly-trained and specialized team that is deployed to various locations as needed to deal with specialized threats or conditions. Mobile Task Forces are designated by a Greek letter and a number (e.g. &#34;MTF Alpha-7&#34;, &#34;MTF Omega-15&#34;) and may have a nickname attached, similar to many real-life military units. MTFs are the elite personnel of the Foundation, and run the gamut from highly experienced field researchers to combat-hardened troops.
* **Normality**/**Normalcy**/**Baseline Reality**/**Consensus Reality** -- The apparently ordinary state of the world, which the Foundation preserves by containing anomalies. See also **The Veil**.
* **[[[o5-command-dossier| O5 Council]]]** (**O5**) -- short for the &#34;Council of Observers, Level 5&#34; or the &#34;Overseer Level 5 Council&#34;. The highest authority in the Foundation, a council of 12 or 13 individuals who have the power to authorize or veto any action taken by the Foundation as a whole. O5 Council members are only known by their numbers (O5-1 through O5-13), are rarely involved in day-to-day Foundation activities, and are typically not allowed to contact any SCP objects directly for fear of contamination. Note that it&#39;s a capital letter &#34;o&#34;, not the number zero.
* **[[[personnel-and-character-dossier| Person of Interest]]]** (**PoI**) -- Individuals of interest to the **Foundation** due to their involvement with the anomalous. May have anomalous abilities, have had contact with an **SCP object** or be a member of a **Group of Interest**. 
* **[REDACTED]** -- One of the two types of censorship used on the site. Something that is &#34;redacted&#34; is withheld from the article because the reader is not cleared to see the information, but would be made available to someone else with a higher **Security Clearance Level**. Should always be in all-caps with square brackets. See also **[DATA EXPUNGED]**.
* **[[[personnel-and-character-dossier| researcher]]]** -- A broad term for anyone involved in research and development at the Foundation - they may be referred to as a Researcher, Technician, Doctor or Professor, depending on their qualifications and specialty. Researchers can be involved in anything from figuring out how an anomalous object or entity functions to developing better materials and containment procedures. Field researchers may also accompany containment teams to assess the nature of uncontained anomalies.
* **response team** -- A heavily armed team trained to deal with security or containment breaches, typically at a secure Foundation site. Response team members are also sent into the field to escort containment teams when dealing with highly hostile or dangerous objects or entities, or when enemy [[[Groups of Interest]]] are involved.
* **[[[security-clearance-levels| Security Clearance Level]]]** -- Specifies the information that a Foundation employee is authorized to know, ranging from 1 (very limited) to 5 (beyond top secret).
* **SCP** -- An [http://en.wikipedia.org/initialism initialism] for &#34;Special Containment Procedures&#34;, and used informally as a short-form of &#34;SCP article&#34;, as in, &#34;I wrote three SCPs yesterday&#34;. SCP objects or entities should not be formally referred to as &#34;an SCP&#34; or &#34;the SCP&#34; in-universe, although characters might do so informally, even using casual pronunciations like &#34;scip&#34; or &#34;skip&#34;. Note that &#34;SCP&#34; is //not// an initialism for &#34;Secure, Contain, Protect&#34;; the motto of the Foundation is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym backronym] derived from &#34;SCP&#34;.
* **SCP object**/**SCP entity** -- An anomaly assigned its own **Special Containment Procedures**.
* **Site** -- A type of [[[secure-facilities-locations| Foundation Facility]]] disguised behind a mundane front (e.g. as a corporation or government office).
* **Species of Interest** (**SoI**) -- Non-human species with anomalous properties. 
* **[[[log-of-unexplained-locations| Unexplained Location]]]** -- A specific place where anomalous phenomena too minor to be assigned **Special Containment Procedures** occur. See also **Location of Interest**, as well as **Nexus** and **Freeport** for inhabited anomalous locations.
* **The Veil** -- A term referring to the separation of the anomalous and the people aware of it from the ordinary world. Actively maintained by organisations like the Foundation that conceal anomalies. 

++ Anomalous Science
Terms used by the Foundation and by other groups to describe the anomalous.

A place with high levels of Akiva radiation has been visited or touched by a god, while a place with low Akiva radiation may be considered forgotten or forsaken by the gods. Named after a Jewish scholar and religious leader, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi_Akiva Rabbi Akiva].
* **Anart** -- Art with anomalous properties, or the use of the anomalous for the purpose of artistic expression. See [[[a-study-of-anomalous-art| this document]]] and [[[anart-lecture| this lecture]]] for further analysis.
* **Anartists** -- Anomalous Artists capable of creating **Anart**, such as the members of [[[are-we-cool-yet-hub| Are We Cool Yet?]]]
* **Antimeme** (also known as a Counterconcept) -- An idea which, by its intrinsic nature, discourages or prevents people from spreading it. The Foundation has an [[[antimemetics-division-hub| Antimemetics Division]]] investigating and containing anomalous antimemes.
* **[[[personnel-and-character-dossier| Apex Tier Pluripotent Entity]]]** -- An incredibly powerful being, possibly omnipotent. Generally used as a clinical term for a god.
* **Aspect Radiation** -- **EVE** emissions intense enough to alter reality - the basis of **thaumatology**.

* **Kinetohazard**/**Kinetoglyphs** -- mental and physical dangers that occur when an entity performs specific gestures and movements.
* **Large-Scale Aggressor** (**LSA**) -- Clinical term for a giant monster.
* **memetic** -- Memes are ideas or behaviours that can be transmitted to others through communication or imitation. In the context of the Foundation, memetic hazards are a sub-class of **cognitohazards** and **infohazards** that deal with transfer of information. Anomalous memetic agents act like a mental virus, triggering anomalous reactions in people who are exposed to them, and potentially spreading from person to person. See [[[Understanding Memetics]]] and [[[memetics-and-infohazards-division-orientation| this orientation]]] for more information.
* **narremes** -- The basic units of a narrative, much like **memes** are the basic units of a culture.

May be referred to as **ontokinesis** or magic, although **thaumatology** is generally regarded as something separate. Humanoid Reality Benders may be referred to as &#34;Type Greens&#34;, using [[[goc-supplemental-threat-entities| Global Occult Coalition terminology]]]. See [[[and-this-one-explains-humes|this FAQ]]] and [[[clef101|this orientation]]] for more information.
* **Semiontological anomaly**/**semiohazard** — Anomalies that disrupt the **Semiosphere** (the medium through which information about reality travels before it is perceived or measured) to create universal axioms that should not be possible.
* **Surrealistics** -- The scientific study of anomalies too incomprehensible or bizarre to understand, except through illogical thought and the use of **agnostics.** 
* **Tartarean Resonance Energy** (**TRE**) -- Radiation naturally produced by demonic entities. Named for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus Tartarus], the part of the Greek Underworld where monsters and sinners are imprisoned.
* **Thaumatology** -- The scientific study of magic, known as **thaumaturgy** (a term meaning &#34;wonder-working&#34; and referring to magic or miracles). See [[[goc-supplemental-thaumatology| this lecture]]] and [[[another-goddamn-magic-system| this orientation]]] for more information.  Users of Magic can be referred to as Thaumatologists, Thaumaturges or &#34;Type Blues&#34; in [[[goc-supplemental-threat-entities| Global Occult Coalition terminology]]].
* **tychekinesis** -- Clinical term for probability manipulation, named for the Greek goddess of fate and fortune, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyche Tyche].

* **Agnostics** -- Substances that makes consumers more open to otherwise incomprehensible anomalous phenomena by altering their thought-patterns to become more illogical. See also **Surrealistics**.
* **amnestic** -- Drugs, procedures, or devices that induce memory loss when administered to an individual. While there are real chemicals with amnestic properties, the Foundation&#39;s fictional amnestics have much greater potency and specificity, allowing them to make civilian witnesses forget about anomalous activity. Although the exact details vary, see the [[[amnestic-orientation-manual| Amnestic Use Guide]]] and the [[[Updated Amnestics Guide]]] for more information. 
* **Apportation** -- Teleportation through **thaumaturgy**.
* **Artificially Intelligent Conscript** (**AIC**) -- An artificial intelligence created and employed by the Foundation&#39;s [[[aiad-homescreen| Artificial Intelligence Applications Division]]].

* **Deepwell server** -- Specialized data storage servers capable of preserving information across shifts in reality. See [[[SCP-4800]]] for more information.
* **Geas** -- The use of memetic agents to force a person to obey a set of rules or guidelines. The name comes from Irish mythology, where a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geas Geas] is a magically enforced prohibition against certain actions.
* **Gnostics** -- The opposite of an **Agnostic**, gnostics make one more certain and sure of things, although this does not necessarily make them correct. 
* **Kant Counter** - Instrument used to measure the **Hume** level of a location, that is, the amount of reality. See [[[and-this-one-explains-humes|this FAQ]]] for more information. Named for the philosopher [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant Immanuel Kant].

* **mnestic** -- The opposite of an **amnestic**, mnestics are chemical compounds that enhance the user&#39;s memory. This can be used to bring back erased or forgotten memories, counter the effects of amnestics, and resist **antimemetic** effects. See the [[[antimemetics-division-hub| Antimemetics Division]]] and the [[[Updated Amnestics Guide]]] for more information.

See [[[and-this-one-explains-humes|this FAQ]]] and [[[grant-request-for-the-manufacture-of-devices-to-regulate| this Grant Request]]] for more information, and [[[reach-s-blueprint-folder| this page]]] for blueprints. May have been named after the inventor, one [[[scp-3001| &#34;Robert Scranton&#34;]]].
* **Telekill** ([[[SCP-148]]]) -- A metal with the property of blocking or preventing anomalous extrasensory mental effects like telepathy and mind control.
* **Xyank-Anastasakos Constant Temporal Sink**/**Xyank-Anastasakos Constant Time Sink** -- Named after Dr. Thaddeus Xyank and Dr. Athena Anastasakos of the Foundation&#39;s Department of Temporal Anomalies. Capable of protecting a place or an object from temporal changes. See [[[reach-s-blueprint-folder| this page]]] for blueprints.

* **[[[archived-scps|Archived]]]** (**ARC**) -- Pages that are outdated or considered low-quality, but were archived rather than being deleted outright. No longer done, except for guides and official pages. The term is occasionally used in universe to refer to anomalies that were formerly assigned an SCP designation. 
* **[[[authors-pages| author page]]]** -- Also known as &#34;personnel files&#34;, these pages are written by site authors once they have written three or more successful articles, as a place to list their body of work. Their contents are entirely up to the author.
* **author avatar** (**AA**) -- Also called a self-insert or an original character (OC), this is a character considered to represent the author in the fictional setting. Can be grounded in reality, ridiculous and over the top, or anything in between. There&#39;s no rule requiring or prohibiting author avatars, but they will be held to the same critical standards as any other fictional character.
* **Blocks** -- the ten sets of 100 articles in each series, such as the &#34;000s Block&#34;, &#34;100s Block&#34; or &#34;1300s Block&#34;.

* **[[[creepy-pasta]]]** -- a term for short stories or snippets that take the form of urban myths and scary stories that are often copied from place to place without attribution or provenance. In site terms, creepypasta are a sub-class of tales that are original work by site members and generally do not rely on the Foundation&#39;s narrative framework.
* **critique** -- Offering feedback on a draft or published SCP. Can be positive, negative or mixed, but must follow the [[[Criticism Policy]]].
* **CSS** (**Cascading Style Sheets**) -- A coding language that can be used to alter the appearance of elements on the site. See [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/manuel-de-formatage-avance this essay] for more information on simple ways this may be used on the site.
* **[[[archived:decommissioned-scps| Decommissioned]]]** (**D**) -- As a site procedure, this refers to SCP articles deemed so egregiously bad that a story was wrote in which staff members&#39; **author avatars** destroyed it, keeping the original article around as a sort of &#34;hall of shame&#34;. This practice has been discontinued, but the term is still used in-universe.
* **draft** -- Any work in progress. Drafts are not allowed on the main site, nor in the forums; please see the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/sandbox SCP Sandbox Wiki] for instructions on how to create a sandbox page for yourself.

++ Community Terminology
* **cold-post** -- A page submitted directly to the site without any kind of review. Can be well received, but the term is usually used in a derogatory manner, referring to work posted by newer members that would have really benefitted from receiving feedback and critique on the **draft**.
* **[[[format-screw-hub| format screw]]]** -- A term for SCP articles that intentionally violate some aspect of the standard SCP format or framework, generally because the SCP itself affects the documentation.
* **headcanon** -- Refers to individual interpretations of inconsistent, ambiguous or non-existent elements of **canon** - people use this term to describe how they imagine aspects of the Foundation universe, while recognizing that it&#39;s only one interpretation. A good example of this would be the exact strengths of the various classes of amnestics, or the precise nature of various K-class Events.
* **hook** -- The aspect of your article or tale that catches your reader&#39;s attention and makes them want to keep reading until the end. A hook has to inspire some sort of curiosity or emotion in your reader; it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be at the very beginning of your article, but it does have to be early enough to make a difference. A hook can also be the aspect of the article or tale that keeps a reader interested after they&#39;re done reading; this can take the form of an interesting revelation or twist ending, and tends to be closer to the end of the writing.
* **&#34;Keter duty&#34;** -- In-universe threats to demote personnel to Class D or otherwise assigning them to dangerous Keter-class objects as a form of punishment. Considered a type of **lolFoundation**.
* **locked box test** -- An informal thought exercise often used to determine what S/E/K classification an object or entity ought to be. It is explained as such:
 * //If it is locked into a box indefinitely and nothing bad will happen, it is probably **Safe**-class.//
 * //If it is locked into a box and we have no idea what might happen, it is probably **Euclid**-class.//
 * //If it is locked into a box and eventually all hell will break loose, it is probably **Keter**-class.//
 * //If it// is //the box, then it is probably **Thaumiel** class.//
* **&#34;lolFoundation&#34;** -- Additions to an SCP article that imply seriously unprofessional conduct among Foundation personnel, such as playing pranks on each other using dangerous anomalous objects or abjectly stupid behavior that is liable to get people injured or killed, as well as threats of punishment for such behavior. While this kind of behavior is generally considered to be too unprofessional for a serious research organization, there is still [[[lolfoundation-hub-page| a place for it]]] on the site.
* **[[[spc-hub|SPC]]]** -- The Shark Punching Center. A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym backronym] created to make fun of people who misspell &#34;SCP&#34; (e.g. &#34;I like the idea, but what does the Shark Punching Center have to do with it?&#34;), subsequently turned into a **GoI**.
