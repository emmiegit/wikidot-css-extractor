**Special Containment Procedures:**
The current president of the United States of America is to remain under video surveillance at all times, with their face in view of a camera as frequently as possible. Recording the president&#39;s face between 19:45 and 20:00[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]All times in this file use UTC-5 (Washington Time). All dates use ISO 8601.[[/span]] is a Level 5/Amida Response situation.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]First Priority, Foundation resources should be diverted from any other tasks, if necessary, to minimize any risk of failure.[[/span]]

To achieve this task, the White House, Congress, the president&#39;s private residence(s), and common presidential speaking avenues should stay fitted with as many discreet, hidden cameras as are required to keep the president&#39;s nose and/or arms in view at all times. Furthermore, agents embedded in the White House are to keep track of the president&#39;s schedule. The president is to be surveyed on any trips out of Washington with hidden cameras and if necessary, long-range surveillance drones or spy agents. All footage is analyzed live by C5092.amk for deviances from normal behavior. C5092.amk is to be checked for any faults weekly.

Between the times 19:40 and 20:10, MTF Theta-20 (&#34;Sniffle Squad&#34;) is to always be within five minutes&#39; travel distance of the president. If at 19:53, the president does not scratch their nose, Theta-20 is to be immediately dispatched to their location. Site-143 has been established nearby the White House to accommodate Theta-20 and provide them quick access to the president in the case that a 5092-B event occurs inside the White House. Additionally, multiple members of Theta-20 have been embedded in the White House Secret Service, and at least four agents are located there at all times. If a 5092-B event should occur, all available Mobile Task Forces are to be mobilized to enact Protocol 34.

Attempts to engineer an anomalous meme (to incite nose scratching at 19:53) powerful enough to withstand President Trump&#39;s [[[*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5004 | reality sink]]] are ongoing.

**Description:**
SCP-5092 is a phenomenon affecting the President of the United States; every night, at exactly 19:53, the president will scratch their nose,[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]This is designated a 5092-A event.[[/span]] regardless of any external factors. This is not due to a direct compulsion to do so but is simply the result of their nose becoming spontaneously itchy.

Occasionally, for an unknown reason, the president will not receive a spontaneous itch at 19:53.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]This is designated a 5092-B event.[[/span]] If this happens and the president subsequently does not scratch their nose, an instance of SCP-5092-1 will materialize instantly approximately 64 800km away from Earth above the North Pole.

SCP-5092-1 is an asteroid with an estimated diameter of 20km that moves at a rate of 18 km/s in the direction of Earth. Foundation models of a collision event between SCP-5092-1 and the Earth have determined that it would result in an XK-Class &#39;end-of-the-world&#39; scenario, causing humans and all other large animal species to go extinct. Upon materialization, SCP-5092-1 will collide with the Earth in ∼1hr,  unless the president scratches their nose during that time, in which case SCP-5092-1 will instantly dematerialize.

**Discovery:**
SCP-5092 was first discovered in 1982 by the second iteration of the Anomalous Signature Recognition Program[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Also known as A.S.R.P.2, this was one of the first times the Foundation used learning algorithms to find anomalies.[[/span]] after being given access to the Foundation&#39;s //Important Political Actors Video Archive//, which contained enough footage of 5092-A events for A.S.R.P.2 to detect the anomaly.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
At 19:56, The [[[*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-179 | COEWS]]][[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Composite Orbital Early Warning System.[[/span]] detected that an anomalous object, 19.7km in diameter, had materialized in the solar system and was heading towards Earth. It predicted that it would collide with Earth in 1hr and 05m. At 19:59, the O5 Council voted 13-0 to declare a code black emergency and enact Protocols 3 and 34. (Protocol 27 could not be enacted due to the lack of notice to the object&#39;s arrival).
[[collapsible show=&#34;⮝ Open Foundation Protocol Database&#34; hide=&#34;⮟ Close Foundation Protocol Database&#34;]]
||~ Protocol ||~ Description ||
|| 34 || In the case of a large anomalous entity appearing in the solar system without notice, protocol 34 is to be enacted in order to preserve the veil. All astronomical organizations with observational equipment capable of viewing the object are to be disrupted through either direct or indirect means for the duration of the object&#39;s arrival. ||
|| 3 || In the case of an imminent anomalous threat with an unknown cause and no known way to stop it, all SCP objects currently in the Foundation&#39;s possession are to be checked for physical alterations and deviations from normal behavior in order to find a potential cause for, and subsequently, a possible solution to the threat. ||

At 20:15, Site-10 reported to Overseer Command a deviance of behavior in SCP-5092. (The deviance was picked up by A5092.amk and discovered by personnel during the Protocol 3 checkup). Without any other leads into the source of the meteor, Overseer Command ordered that efforts be made to make The President scratch his nose.

At 20:18, Agents at Site-10 contacted President Obama and attempted to convince him to scratch his nose.

 At 20:21, Overseer Command contacted Site-12, located within the Washington metropolitan area, to assemble a temporary MTF for the purpose of making the President scratch his nose.

At 20:36, Temporary Task Force Epsilon-33 successfully infiltrated the White House under the guise of Secret Service agents and achieved the mission goal at 20:51, neutralizing the threat.

**Goal:** To make President Barack Obama initiate nose scratching before 21:00.
 
**Personnel involved**: TMTF Epsilon-33, comprised of Agents Young-Soo Ryu (Commander), Rose Maryland, Henry Farmer, Jarvis Bradley, Sam McCarthy, Sara Lineham, and Benjamin Jackson.
 
**Containment Plan:** Agents Ryu, Maryland, Farmer, and Bradley (ε-33-A) would enter the White House under the guise of Secret Service and locate the President while Agents McCarthy, Lineham, and Jackson (ε-33-B) secure the perimeter under the guise of cleaners and gardeners.

**Agent Ryu:** Everything is going fine comman- RUN THAT RED LIGHT!
 
//ε-33 turns, barely avoiding collision with a blue car. Multiple screams are heard behind ε-33.//
 
**Agent Farmer:** //FUCK!//
 
**Command:** Ryu, we&#39;ve just been informed MTF Alpha-45 (&#34;Janitors&#34;) are on their way to assist with any post-mission cleanup.

**Agent Rose Maryland:** Wait, why are //we// looking for the President? Isn&#39;t that place full of cameras?

**Agent Ryu:** Yes, but they aren&#39;t live. They just store their recordings and send them to Site-10 each hour. They&#39;re old too.  Half of them don&#39;t even- Turn right there! -work right.

**Agent Maryland:** What cheap losers would-?

**Agent Ryu:** (//To Agents McCarthy, Lineham, and Jackson//) Wait three minutes before getting out of the vehicle. Make sure no one sees you exit.
 
**Agent Sam McCarthy:** Understood.
 
**Agent Maryland:** Shit. eight o&#39;clock.

**Command:** Eighteen minutes to midnight.
 
**Agent Ryu:** Any sign of the President yet?

**Agent Farmer:**  (//whispering//) Nothing in the basement so far.
 
**Agent Ryu:** The Oval Office was empty. I&#39;m heading to the Vice President&#39;s now.

**Site-143 Command:** Agent Lineheart, we have been informed that 5092-1 has materialized. Current intel suggests that President Obama is located in the White House. The rest of Theta-20 will arrive in five minutes.

**Agent Rose Lineheart:** Where&#39;s the President at?
 
**Site Command:** Cameras are showing President Obama is in the Resident Villa.
 
**Agent Lineheart:** Copy, heading to Resident Villa.
 
//Agent Lineheart reaches the Resident Villa after five minutes, occasionally diverting paths to avoid suspision.//
 
**Agent Lineheart:** I have reached the target&#39;s location. Is there anyone else in the Villa?
 
**Site Command:** Not currently. Target appears to be asleep. The use of T-128C is suggested.
 
**Agent Lineheart:** Copy, proceeding to target.
 
//Agent Lineheart spends three minutes silently walking towards the target&#39;s bedroom.//
 
**Agent Lineheart:** I have reached the target&#39;s location. Entering now.
 
//Agent Lineheart slowly pushes open the door to the Obama&#39;s bedroom. He is sleeping in his bed. Agent Lineheart slowly walks towards his location and examines him.//

//Agent Lineheart removes T-128C from her suit and removes the cap.//

**Agent Lineheart:** (//whispering//) Deploying T-128C now.
 
**Site Command:** Copy.
 
//Agent Lineheart deploys T-128C on Obama. After seven seconds there is no physical response.//
 
**Agent Lineheart:** //(whispering)// No response from target. Attempting again.

**Site Command:** Understood. Caution is advised.
 
//Agent Lineheart deploys T-128C on Obama for a second time, this time on a different location on the nose. After five seconds, there is still no response from Obama.//
 
**Agent Lineheart:** (//whispering//) No response, preparing for third deployment.
 
**Site Command:** Granted, proceed.
 
//As Agent Lineheart is about to use T-128C again, Obama rolls over in bed. Agent Lineheart pauses briefly, checking the status of the target. Obama appears to still be asleep. Agent Lineheart waits one minute before continuing.//

**Agent Lineheart:** Initiating.

**Use Guide:** T-128C is a metal and rubber cylinder with a flashlight at the top and a thin slit on the base. At the back of the cylinder, there is a switch that is used to turn the flashlight off and on.

A discreet button at the bottom of the cylinder is used to eject a feather-like apparatus from the slit. The same button can be used to retract the feather back into the slit. A plastic cap can be placed over the base to hide the slit. To remove the cap, squeeze both sides and twist.

The feather-like device can be used to create &#39;ticklish&#39; or &#39;itchy&#39; feelings in conscious or unconscious individuals in order to elicit a physical response (rubbing the affected area).

**[Begin Log, 29:57]**
[[/=]]

**Donald Trump:** Hello?
 
**Agent Archer:** Hello Mr President, it&#39;s fantastic to talk to you. I&#39;m from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

**Donald Trump:** Well, thank you very much! You know, I hear there are many fine people- brilliant people- at the FBI.

**Agent Archer:** Thank you Mr. President. I have a very important message for you.

**Donald Trump:** Is this about those anarchists and looters? Right now, they are destroying this fantastic city. If you were here, well you might be but you understand, I guarantee you would be very upset. Everyone here is you know. But many people are scared to say it. But I&#39;m being told, that there isn&#39;t anything else we can do. And you see people say, &#34;oh, we can&#39;t be brutal. The police are being too brutal. We have to save the poor people&#34; But what about our beautiful churches? What about St Johns? They set it on fire, you know. Very horrible.

**Agent Archer:** Yes. Yes, definitely. As I was saying, I have a message from Director Wray.

**Donald Trump:** You know, I sometimes get the sense that Director Wray doesn&#39;t like me very much. But I do admire him. Very strong man.

**Agent Archer:** Agreed. So Director Wray wanted to let you know- (//Agent Archer pauses//) Sorry, I just had a bit of nose itch.

**Donald Trump:** It&#39;s funny. I seem to get a lot of those.

**Agent Archer:** Oh, really? I experience the same thing!

**Donald Trump:** Oh yes. I&#39;ll be doing important work- which, you know, many people say I don&#39;t do work, and it&#39;s just not true, I do a lot more work than many other people, very important work, then I see people saying &#34;Oh, that man doesn&#39;t do work&#34;. But yes, I will be at my desk, and I will often get scratches. And it doesn&#39;t seem to leave. You know, sometimes you have an itch, like a toe itch, and it might be there for a while- and will be very annoying- but it will go away. And it is very strange if it doesn&#39;t go away. And I often think &#34;this itch will go away&#34;, and then a few days later I have another nose itch. And I told- well I don&#39;t remember who it was exactly- but they said &#34;Donald, you should talk to a doctor&#34; and I just think, what a waste of time it would to see a doctor because my nose is itchy. Maybe it isn&#39;t. But I think it is.

**Agent Archer:** Maybe you should see a doctor? You never know with these things. Maybe it&#39;s a symptom of a bigger problem that you don&#39;t know about?

**Donald Trump:** Yes, I did think, maybe it is a problem. But I don&#39;t think it is. I&#39;m very healthy. I often get people- maybe doctors- telling me &#34;You are very healthy for your age. I haven&#39;t met people at your age that healthy&#34; and it would just be very strange- not impossible- but strange if I had, perhaps, one of those, nose cancers, or other very bad diseases.

**Agent Archer:** (//To Operator Atkins//) Has 5092-1 dematerialized?

**Operator Atkins:** Not yet.

**Agent Archer:** Well you know, even very healthy people get health problems. They say that noses are, uh, very vulnerable areas.

**Donald Trump:** Many people say that &#34;Oh, healthy people get just as many diseases as large people&#34;. but I don&#39;t think it is true- maybe in some cases- many healthy people are getting the ChinaVirus, which is very, very unfortunate- but that&#39;s how diseases work, it&#39;s very difficult to avoid. Many people say to wear the facemasks, but we just aren&#39;t sure how much they help. You know, Fauci was saying first, &#34;Oh, don&#39;t wear the mask. They are ineffective&#34;, and now he&#39;s saying &#34;Wear the mask, everyone needs to wear the masks&#34; and, you know, he might be right, he&#39;s a very, very smart man. But we just aren&#39;t sure how important they are right now.

**Agent Archer:** (//To Operator Atkins//) Anything?

**Operator Atkins:** No sir.

**Agent Archer:** (//To Operator Atkins//) This isn&#39;t working.

**Agent Archer:** Well sir, it has been a pleasure speaking to you. It seems we may even have something in common in the nose department! Director Wray just wanted to let you know that he will have a very important report on your desk tomorrow.

**Donald Trump:** Goodbye. Very good talk!

**Containment Log 5092-1-C**
[[/=]]
 
**Goal:** To make President Donald Trump initiate nose scratching before 20:45. 20:49 at the latest.
 
**Personnel involved:** MTF Theta-20 (&#34;Sniffle Squad&#34;), transported in two vehicles.

**Containment Plan:** Theta-20 would break into the Presidential Emergency Operations Center and make President Trump scratch his nose.

**Prior Events:** Theta-20 Agents embedded within the White House Secret Service attempted to reach the President, however, the President had been moved to the underground Presidential Emergency Operations Center (due to safety concerns regarding the protests occurring around Capitol Hill at the time), and the Theta-20 Agents were not given access. Backup was required to forcefully bypass high security.
 
**Event log:**

||~ Time ||~  Event||
||19:48 ||As they drive, Theta-20 vehicles begin dispensing large amounts of tear gas ahead of them to disperse the protestors crowding the streets. Multiple times, protestors attempted to assault the vehicles and had to be shot with rubber bullets to allow Theta-20 to keep moving.||
||20:12||Theta-20&#39;s vehicles stop outside of Lafayette Square.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]A park across from the White House, over Pennsylvania Ave NW, bordered off during the protests.[[/span]] Theta-20 exit the vehicles and approach the police line.||
||20:15||The Theta-20 Commander shows the officers at the front of the police line their valid Secret Service credentials. The police officer expresses surprise, and decides to radio his superiors to ask about Theta-20.||
||20:16||His superior expresses confusion at Theta-20&#39;s arrival, and after 50 seconds it is clear that Theta-20 is not going to be given immediate access.||
||20:17||Theta-20 decides to forcefully bypass the police line. The two vehicles, parked roughly 10 meters away from the police line, begin to dispense aerosolized amnestic/sedative gas in the surrounding area, subduing and amnesticizing protestors, while Theta-20 rush the police line and attack the police officers with electroshock batons.||
||20:18||As the White House security begins preparation for an imminent attack from Theta-20, agents embedded within the White House begin jamming all communications to and from the White House.||
||20:21||As Theta-20 reaches the halfway point across Lafayette Square, hidden White House snipers begin firing upon the Task Force. Multiple agents are hit, mostly due to the lack of cover in the Park.||
||20:25||Cameras show a dozen well-armed Government Agents waiting for Theta-20 in the Diplomatic Reception Room and surrounding area. To ambush them, Theta-20 first deployed a silencing turtle (SCP-███), to surround the White House with a field of sound wave suppression, then detonated remote explosives on the back wall to gain entry.||
||20:26||Theta-20 attack the WH agents from behind, engaging in a firefight that causes considerable damage to the White House interior and results in multiple Theta-20 casualties. White House goes on full lockdown.||
||20:32||Theta-20 uses remote explosives to break through a secure blast door leading into the East Wing. Embedded Agents disable traps.||
||20:33||A Remote Concentrated Energy Turret located in the East Wing hallway terminates four Theta-20 Agents before being neutralized via grenade.||
||20:35||Theta-20 is jumped by five heavily armored officers armed with shotguns. Upon termination, the final officer self-detonates, killing multiple Theta-20 Agents.||
||20:41||Theta-20 Agents use remote demolition to break through a reinforced steel door.||
||20:43||After fighting a few more White House agents, Theta-20 again use remote demolition to break into the underground Presidential Emergency Operations Center.||
||20:44||Theta-20 enter the Operations Center and terminate several hostile agents. Since they cannot speak due to the ongoing effects of the silencing turtle, Theta-20 attempt to communicate to Donald Trump with sign language that he needs to scratch his nose. ||
||20:48||After four minutes of trying various forms of communication without success, a Theta-20 agent grabs onto Trump&#39;s arm and physically forces him to scratch his own nose.||

**Aftermath:** At 20:49, MTF Alpha-45 (&#34;Janitors&#34;) arrived at the White House to perform post-mission cleanup. The White House was repaired, all witnesses were amnesticized (largely through the mass use of aerosolized amnestic gas deployed under the guise of tear gas), witnesses unaccounted for were discredited, and dead US government personnel were erased from all records.

+ Department of Spectral Phenomena
[[size 200%]] Spectral Entity No. 556[[/size]]
[[/=]]
**Status:** Recurring Manifestations, SCP Classification Pending
 
**Location:** USA, District of Columbia, particularly the area surrounding Capitol Hill
 
**Description:** SE-556 appears to be a man in his late 70&#39;s (although ectoplasm dating shows they are actually around 600 years old). They wear black boots, dark pants, a long brown trench coat, a pair of round glasses, and a dark trilby hat with a removable feather attached to its side in an almost magnetic fashion.

SE-556 is a [[[*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4973 | Class II Spectral Entity]]] (It lacks malevolence and expresses a very limited ability to interact with the physical world).
 
**Behaviour:** For most of the day, SE-556 is fairly dormant. They will wander from street to street occasionally but spend most of their day sitting on benches in either parks or the wharf next to Potomac River. While sitting, they may watch pedestrians or animals, read outdated newspapers (Newspapers are also spectral), stare up at the sky, or sleep. Notably, every day at around 7:52 PM, SE-556 seems to produce a portal of some kind, and step through it, only to return ten minutes later. Occasionally, SE-556 can be seen toying with its feather prior to this event.
 
**Addendum:** Analysis of SE-556&#39;s behavior by the Spiritual Psychology Division has concluded that SE-556 is experiencing the early stages of Spectro-Cognitive Degradation Disorder (SCDD).
