**Description:** --SCP-001-J-- Indigo is a male Siberian Husky,[[footnote]]//Canis lupus familiaris//[[/footnote]] approximately 18 months old and currently employed as Dr. Eugene Holland&#39;s service canine. --SCP-001-J-- //Indigo// exhibits --a--typical characteristics and behaviors expected from others of this nature, including a thick double coat, brown-blue heterochromia, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings. --SCP-001-J-- **//Indigo//** is in excellent health --and will probably outlive us all--.

--SCP-001-J-- __**//Indigo//**__ displays --extra--ordinary intelligence and dexterity compared to non-anomalous members of its species. Observed talents include problem-solving skills, memory retention, and a capacity for human communication reaching --far beyond-- parity with other canines.[[footnote]] As per data acquired from subjects equipped with specialized performance-measuring resources, such as tiny treadmills, weighted harnesses, K-12 Common Core learning environments, etcetera.[[/footnote]]

Although harmless to a vast majority of humans, those with specific occupations and intentions (e.g. home invaders, muggers, suspicious postal workers, Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, and so on) should exhibit mild caution while in close proximity. According to Dr. Holland, the canine &#34;can tear bad guys to shreds, but would never hurt a fly elsewise, even if it flew into his ear&#34;. Therefore, no security detail or responsive containment is required.[[footnote]]Containment is accomplished with ease by placing food underneath a box labeled &#34;FREE CHOW&#34;, rigged via a propped-up stick tied with a length of string.[[/footnote]] 

Care is to be delivered the same as any other domesticated canine of this size, age, and lifestyle.

Following first pass revision of this proposal, Dr. Holland was reported for committing several dozen unauthorized changes and reverts to the documentation in RAISA possession. His editing permissions were then emergency revoked, after which Dr. Holland proceeded to submit thirty-five additional (and largely identical) 001 proposals over the next three months, averaging 2-3 per week, all of which were denied. 

A stop order and voluntary summons were provided in triplicate to Dr. Holland, who failed to report to his supervisor within the allotted timeframe. Dr. Holland and his dog of interest[[footnote]] Now designated DoI-001, for ease of reference. [[/footnote]] were then taken in for questioning.

&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** Hey, uh, you wanted to see me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** You could say that. More necessary than desired, and I&#39;m not exactly a dog person.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** Cats?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Allergies. //&lt;Turns to DoI-001.&gt;// Please keep a wide berth around my sinuses. Sound good?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** Hm? Oh, he can&#39;t talk. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** I&#39;m aware. So, Eugene, I&#39;ve requested your presence via email several times now. What gives? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** I haven&#39;t got a thing from anyone today, I assure you; I don&#39;t really get emails nowadays. God, how long //has// it been? //&lt;Trails off in contemplation.&gt;//[[footnote]]Later inspection revealed a loose ethernet cable in the back of Dr. Holland&#39;s computer.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** //&lt;Sighs.&gt;// Dr. Holland, you recently submitted a proposal for SCP-001. Quite a few of them, if you recall.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** Yes, and...? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** And? Wait, //you did that on purpose?//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** //&lt;Taken aback.&gt;// Of course. The article kept being altered without my permission. I don&#39;t even know who edited the thing in the first place.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** //I did.// It&#39;s my job. Do you have //any// idea how much work you have given me? How much time I wasted on this?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** You could&#39;ve consulted me first. I would have cleared things up, or heck, just showed you– he&#39;s right here!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** I know, I can feel his presence now. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** ...//huh?// 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Because- You get it. Allergies. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** Oh, I wasn&#39;t aware, apologies. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** How? I //just// told- forget it. Please explain the impetus for claiming your //dog// should be a candidate for SCP-001?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** Indigo. His name is Indigo, and he&#39;s no ordinary canine companion. He&#39;s an absolute genius. A prodigy among tail-chasers, with complete mastery over every trick in the book; Sit, stay, roll over, even //play dead//. Oh, I can show you! 
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Dr. Holland retrieves a sandwich bag from his back pocket, filled with crushed dog biscuits.&gt;// 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** Agh, I have to stop doing that. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** //&lt;Clears throat.&gt;// My time is valuable. You should know these proposals aren&#39;t for every single mundane thing we come across, no matter how well it may follow simple direction. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** I know, but Indigo //is// extraordinary, in his own, clearly observable and downright adorable way. I mean, did you get a good peep at those eyes? He looks into your soul. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Everyone loves their pets, Eugene, but—
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** No, I mean it. You&#39;re probably standing at the wrong angle. Here.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Dr. Holland picks up DoI-001 and plants it in direct eyeline of Dr. ██████.&gt;//
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** Look into his eyes. They&#39;re like oceans. //&lt;Looking back at DoI-001.&gt;// Okay, one of them is like an ocean. The blue one.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Yes, I see that. What I fail to see is how this makes him anomalous, let alone a fitting proposal for the SCP-001 slot.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;The Husky barks and jumps up on Dr. Holland, tail slapping Dr.██████’s shin as the two playfully wrestle on the floor. Dr. ██████ backs away and, after waiting for several seconds, interjects.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Dr. Holland.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** : Oh! Sorry about that. Anyway, I figure this is enough to get the ball rolling. Right? You can speak to someone, get this situation taken care of and our proposals pushed through? Realistically, I only need one approved. You can probably just toss the others.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Really? You&#39;re serious? Um... //Okay//. Give me a moment. 
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Dr. ██████ sighs, exiting the room shortly afterwards.&gt;//
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; //Note: Dr. ██████ contacted RAISA Director Maria W. Jones to relay progress and discuss plans of action.

&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Alright. While the administration appreciates your... //enthusiasm//, there is still some confusion regarding your rationale behind the choice to submit thirty-six 001 proposals about Diego.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** //&lt;Absentmindedly petting DoI-001 while it salivates on the tiled floor.&gt;// Mhm. Wait, //Diego?// It&#39;s Indigo. Like the color.
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Animal stares at ██████, who returns the gaze, wordlessly. The air between the two is thick with tension.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** Ohhh, looks like he wants some love! I think he likes you. Get in here!
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** //&lt;Backing away.&gt;// No thanks, I&#39;m allergic. Remember? Anyway, getting back to the point, please demonstrate, to myself and the observing parties, any anomalous properties your dog, er, //Indigo//, possesses?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** Absolutely! //&lt;Looking over at the opaque observation window, DoI-001 firmly planted on his lap.&gt;// In technical terms, Indigo is a vessel of essophysically-pure kindness and good vibes, or as I call it, Wholesomatic radiation. It&#39;s a measurably quantifiable emission of positivity![[footnote]]It is not.[[/footnote]] Indigo never barks too loudly, he doesn&#39;t chew on furniture or anyone he shouldn&#39;t, and he&#39;s always there when you need company. In my eyes, an ultimate anomaly; An embodiment of everything good in this often bleak world. Isn’t that worth designation as SCP-001?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Not really. How does that compare to anomalies of untold, Earth-shattering ability? //&lt;Sneezes.&gt;// Pardon. //&lt;Sniffles.&gt;// Items of absolute power, or great value or whatever—//oh//—//&lt;Sneezes.&gt;// Sorry. Never—//&lt;Sneezes.&gt;// Sorry. Never in my twenty years working for this organization has an employee been in my presence with—//&lt;Sneezes.&gt;//—with such a misunderstanding of the designation–//&lt;Sneezes several times in quick succession.&gt;// Sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** //&lt;Lifting DoI-001 to face-height and briefly touching noses with the animal, who reacts positively to the gesture.&gt;// No, we&#39;re on the same page. Well, Indigo and I, of course, but you and I are, too. Not every anomaly has to be flashy or universe-creating, right? Proposals don’t even need to be the actual 001. The few I&#39;ve seen feel like they&#39;re only SCP-001 to the person who submits the proposal. Besides, there&#39;re like, what, fifty of them now? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Fifty-one, in the main archive.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** Is there a maximum number the Foundation allows or something? Doesn&#39;t feel like it to me. At any rate, Indigo fits just as perfectly as any other; He may not control time or shoot lasers from his eyes, but he does have control of my heart. He may not have formed the world we stand on, but he&#39;s my entire world.   
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;A pause. Dr. ██████ sneezes.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Er- Okay. //&lt;Looks to the one-way glass for direction, but the panel refuses to be anything other than a reflective surface. Dr. ██████ waves frantically at the mirror.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** What? Are they doing something?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** I... don&#39;t know? I&#39;ll ask. Be right back. I need an antihistamine, anyway.

&gt; * Indigo, Dog of Interest (DoI-001)

&gt; = {{[BEGIN LOG]}}
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** //&lt;Looking up.&gt;// You&#39;re back again. I heard voices. Seems like things were getting pretty heated, probably &#39;cos none of you have experienced a good boy quite like this before. Got you all rustled.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Uh... I guess so.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** And did I hear someone suggest //launching him into the Sun//? Seems excessive.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** No, we were talking about you. Don&#39;t worry, our only working Sun catapult is on the moon, and we lost the launch data to get there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** //&lt;Pauses.&gt;// Well, any news about Indigo&#39;s Proposal? I decided to name it after him, only fitting. //&lt;Dr. Holland reaches out a hand to his side, without looking, and DoI-001 comes trotting up to him a moment later.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Right. After much deliberation, I regret to inform you that your proposal//s// do not align with the well-established standards for the prestigious SCP-001 slot. I&#39;m going to have to ask you to stop submitting proposals of any kind involving your service animal. If it helps to know, I really went to bat for you, but the admins have very strong convictions about this topic. I&#39;m sure you understand. Do you have any final statements or points you failed to mention as to why this—//&lt;Looks to DoI-001 who is cleaning its underside with its tongue.&gt;//—should be considered?  
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** Look. I know he&#39;s not as important to the Foundation as he is to me. Sometimes, an anomaly is just an anomaly. It’s unique for one reason or another. Indigo is special and unlike any doggo you’ll ever encounter. I want everyone to know how amazing he is, but, alas. I know it would undoubtedly destroy the Veil if Indigo went public. //&lt;Turns to face DoI-001.&gt; Isn&#39;t that right? Destroy the Veil with how cute and smart and talented you are! Gooood boyyyy!// 
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;DoI-001 looks up, tilting its head to the side quizzically, as if expecting some unknown response. The look fades when Dr. Holland starts scratching behind the animal&#39;s ear.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** I hardly consider that a realistic worry to have. //&lt;Sneezes.&gt;// Can- Can you stop petting him for just a few minutes? The meds haven&#39;t kicked in yet and I can see all the hair and dander getting everywhere, oh god- //&lt;Sneezes.&gt;//
&gt;  
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** //&lt;Wistfully&gt;// Ahhh, //Husky Glitter//. He&#39;s brought so much joy and love into my life. If that&#39;s not anomalous, I don&#39;t know what is. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** //&lt;Sneezes.&gt;// While I understand where you’re coming from, your proposal lacks empirical evidence of anomalous behavior. It feels ina-na-naaaa-//&lt;Aims head away to sneeze again, but does not this time.&gt;// Ahem. It feels inappropriate to approve, is what I was saying.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Holland:** I get you. //&lt;Sighs.&gt;// But, for the record, Indigo is still the goodest of good boys. Maybe not the world&#39;s most notable anomaly, but definitely mine. Oh, and he can do this! //&lt;Gestures.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;DoI-001 stands upright on its back legs and begins singing an Italian opera, specifically Ruggero Leoncavallo&#39;s &#39;Pagliacci&#39;.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** Th- //&lt;Sneezes.&gt;// The //fuck?//  
&gt; 
&gt; //&lt;Roughly four minutes later, DoI-001 is observed taking a bow, returning to four legs with a bark shortly thereafter. Dr. Holland then provided DoI-001 with a small piece of biscuit.&gt;//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. ██████:** ...You //really// should&#39;ve led with that.
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; //Note: Following this interview, Dr. Holland&#39;s 36 proposals were given new consideration. Request(s) denied, again. As a compromise, he was allowed to choose another valid alphanumeric slot, so long as it was unused and did not contain &#34;001&#34; in any capacity. Anomaly designated --SCP-OHOHONE-J--.[[footnote]]No. Did you really think that would work?[[/footnote]] Anomaly hesitantly designated SCP-NUMBERONEDOGGO-J.//
&gt; 
&gt; //Dr. Holland is advised to refrain from submitting proposals for SCP-001 in the future. At least, not unless they&#39;re really, **really** badass.//
