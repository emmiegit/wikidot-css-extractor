//We found this piece of poem in a broken jewelry box,
at that time, she had gone already//

Were you there when I descried a dark moon
Were you there when I witnessed a crimson sky
Were you there when I first saw you
That in the azure you wept
And stars cried

Were you there when I was made
Were you there when I was complete
Were you there when you kissed me
And the light in me was brightened

Were you there when I’m drowned in brimful voids
Were you there when I’m within noisy silences
Were you there when I held you
While within there you suffered
And I’m about to die

Were you there when I was grey-haired
Were you there when I was faded
Were you there when you left me
And the cosmos silently died</textarea></pre>
