**Special Containment Procedures:** Currently, all 216 known instances of SCP-CN-1463-1 are contained in Standard Humanoid Containment Units at Site-CN-33. MTF-辰巳-33 &#34;Hard Work Pays Off&#34; has administered Class-A amnestics to all humans who have had direct contact with SCP-CN-1463-1 instances and is tasked with retrieving any uncontained instances of SCP-CN-1463-1 for containment. Currently, only female researchers are allowed to conduct interviews with SCP-CN-1463-1 instances. Further research into the Groups of Interest &#34;Japan Organisms Improvement and Creation Laboratory&#34; and &#34;PAMWAC&#34; is currently underway.

No experimentation or testing on SCP-CN-1463-2 instances is permitted. All instances of SCP-CN-1463-2 are contained at Site-CN-33 in Standard Anomalous Object Containment Unit #60. Two fully armed agents are to guard Standard Anomalous Object Containment Unit #60 at all times, and are to terminate any unauthorized personnel who attempt to enter the containment unit and retrieve SCP-CN-1463-2. Guards are to be changed every 4 hours.

**Description:** SCP-CN-1463-1 is the designation for a group of anomalous humanoids with similar features. SCP-CN-1463-1 appear to be human females between the ages of 10 to 18, possessing the following anomalous traits: a pair of ears on the head identical to those of housecats (//Felis catus Linnaeus//), a feline tail extending from the coccyx the length of which depends on the height of the instance, and eyes similar to those of housecats. These features vary between SCP-CN-1463-1 instances, but always correspond to the characteristics of a specific breed of housecat. SCP-CN-1463-1&#39;s physical development ceases at the age of 18 years. SCP-CN-1463-1 are capable of communication in Chinese and Japanese, and are of the same intellect as a typical human. As of this writing, no instance of SCP-CN-1463-1 has made ant attempt to escape containment.

SCP-CN-1463-1 instances are capable of communicating with each other over long distances. It is theorized that this ability uses an unknown form of psychic wave to transfer information between their brains.

SCP-CN-1463-2 is a collection of --17-- 15 anomalous objects appearing to be capsules. Upon opening a capsule, an instance of SCP-CN-1463-1 approximately 10 years of age will emerge from the capsule. Instances manifest asleep and awaken after 1 to 2 hours. It is currently unclear how SCP-CN-1463-1 can be contained within a capsule that is far smaller than the resulting object. Due to the limited resources available to Site-CN-33, it is strictly forbidden to open the remaining instances of SCP-CN-1463-2.

SCP-CN-1463-1&#39;s anomalous properties manifest when any male human (henceforth &#34;the subject&#34;) has been in the vicinity of SCP-CN-1463-1 for a total of 24 hours. At this point, the subject will become obsessed with and protective of the instance of SCP-CN-1463-1. This effect compounds as the subject remains in the vicinity of SCP-CN-1463-1, and may even exceed similar feelings the subject feels for his own friends and family. This is believed to be an anomalous effect inherent to SCP-CN-1463-1 and cannot be treated with amnestics; however, when the individual is forcibly removed from SCP-CN-1463-1, these effects will slowly reduce in intensity and abate.

On 2019/08/12, the Foundation discovered an online announcement jointly made by the Japan Organisms Improvement and Creation Laboratory and PAMWAC[[footnote]] Research Projects Agency for the Marriage with Anime Characters [[/footnote]] (see addenda). In the following month, the Foundation discovered a large amount of SCP-CN-1463-1 instances in public places and an anomalous increase in incidents relating to registration of pet cats. This was confirmed as anomalous and MTF-辰巳-33 &#34;Hard Work Pays Off&#34; subsequently contained all instances of SCP-CN-1463-1. As a result of SCP-CN-1463-1&#39;s anomalous effects, affected subjects strongly resisted the containment of SCP-CN-1463-1, significantly hampering containment efforts. It is noted that the Foundation subsequently discovered 17 instances of SCP-CN-1463-2 in an abandoned facility suspected to be owned by JOICL and a further 3 instances in the possession of individuals apprehended during containment of SCP-CN-1463-1. It is speculated that SCP-CN-1463-2 also possesses a similar cognitohazardous effect. The aforementioned online announcement has been taken down.

[Begin Transcript]

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Good morning, Doctor.

**Dr. Bruce:** Good morning, Agent Carson. You&#39;ve all done quite a lot of work these few days.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** No, no, don&#39;t say that. To contain these catgirls has been quite rewarding for us. Those fat otakus couldn&#39;t stand a chance against our team. Think about it, what can they do to us?

**Dr. Bruce:** But they were spread out over such a large area, and there were only 200-something of them. They were distributed all over Japan and down the Yangtze. That doesn&#39;t sound like it can be very efficient.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** You&#39;re right, most of this mission was spent on the road. It was boring, and must&#39;ve affected morale, but there wasn&#39;t any real effect.

**Dr. Bruce:** Let&#39;s hear about your experiences. I think I can suggest a few things for you. We&#39;ll be entering into the second phase of containment efforts in China, and I think this&#39;ll help you out.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** There&#39;s no need for that, Doctor. It wasn&#39;t that hard to track them down. The first phase wasn&#39;t anything for us to be proud of. We just told the otaku we had to apprehend: &#34;That&#39;s your girlfriend, right? We&#39;re the police, we need to take her in for something, she&#39;ll be back in no time.&#34; Then we went back a few hours later with amnestics.

**Dr. Bruce:** There wasn&#39;t any resistance from them?

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Those catgirls were very reserved. They didn&#39;t resist containment. If you&#39;re talking resistance, then those degenerate otaku tried, at least. Oh, this is great, let me tell you. The afternoon of the 25th, when we tried to contain one of those loli catgirls, some fat otaku - a bald programmer, at that - started to shout at us, going all &#34;Where are you taking my daughter?!&#34; and wanting to fight us. Carrie just sprayed the amnestics in his face and he shut up pretty quick.

**Dr. Bruce:** That&#39;s surprisingly simple.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** I really admire the work of JOICL. These catgirls, they were like Barbie dolls, all perfect and beautiful. Compared to them, we ladies who only do physical work are pretty damn ugly. Incidentally, Doctor, I&#39;ve got a request for you. To be honest, I don&#39;t really feel the need to ask you for this, but it&#39;s really easy.

**Dr. Bruce:** Let&#39;s finish our business here first. 

//Dr. Bruce produces a photograph from his pocket.//

**Dr. Bruce:** This man is Cao Bin, 27 years old, from Shanghai, currently unemployed. He seems to know a lot about things, including your containment attempts. Yesterday afternoon, we saw 112 people in private cars gathered on a farm on Chongming Island[[footnote]] Translator&#39;s note: Chongming Island is an island at the mouth of the Yangtze, officially part of the municipality of Shanghai. [[/footnote]]. All of the cars had catgirls in the back. The guy leading this operation is Cao Bin. We monitored him through a drone and it seems like he&#39;s trying to get these guys to escape.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** That kinda thing, huh? Why didn&#39;t you do anything?

**Dr. Bruce:** At that point SCP-CN-████ was breaching containment, and we had to use all our resources containing it. Really bad timing, I know. We found out this morning that all of them are already escaping from Shanghai. You girls better get ready.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** My god...

**Dr. Bruce:** These must be the anomalous effects. Normal people wouldn&#39;t go that far.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** God, this kind of wide-area distribution is such a headache. We managed to catch them off guard for the first mission, and we could even trick them into giving us their catgirls. This time they might pull off something really bad for us. Say, is there anything special about these people that I need to know?

**Dr. Bruce:** One thing. //(Dr. Bruce retrieves a notebook from his pocket.)// Hang on... Two people you need to know. One is Feng Zijian. He&#39;s been a special ops soldier, though he&#39;s been retired for a year and a half; he definitely can fight back. The other is Zhang Leyi. He&#39;s a //fuerdai//[[footnote]] Translator&#39;s note: A Chinese term used to indicate the child of someone who is wealthy and has connections.[[/footnote]] and his dad is a high-ranking officer in the military. God knows what he&#39;ll pull on us.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Alright. We&#39;re leaving tonight, so we can get them by surprise under cover of night.

**Dr. Bruce:** If there&#39;s anything else, ask Dr. Yuannn. She&#39;s got information on all of these guys on her computer. I got the information on these two guys from her. I&#39;m expecting good news from you all.

**Record 2019/08/28 - Event004**：
&gt; 2019/08/28, 1:52 AM: MTF-辰巳-33-1 discovered groups led by PoI-4639[[footnote]]The aforementioned Cao Bin.[[/footnote]] in a forest approximately 279 km from the southwestern part of Hangzhou city. During containment efforts, MTF-辰巳-33-1 faced heavy resistance from individuals affected by SCP-CN-1463-1&#39;s anomalous effects. At 2:17 AM, 31 instances of SCP-CN-1463-1 were brought into Foundation custody by MTF-辰巳-33-1, and Class-B amnestics were administered to all affected individuals. Affected individuals were returned to their residences. The remaining 82 affected individuals, including PoI-4639, escaped along with the instances of SCP-CN-1463-1 accompanying them.

**Record 2019/08/29 - 185628:**

[Start Recording, 2019/08/29, 4:17 AM]

//The video is from 辰巳-33-1-5&#39;s perspective. The team is located in a forest on the outskirts of Hangzhou.//

//The camera shakes violently, accompanied by panting. 辰巳-33-1-4 appears in frame, running.

**辰巳-33-1-4:** Come on, we need to catch up!

**辰巳-33-1-5:** (//coughs//)

**辰巳-33-1-2:** Carrie, are you okay?

**辰巳-33-1-5:** Yeah, just choked.

**辰巳-33-1-2:** This is ridiculous, they&#39;re moving locations.

**辰巳-33-1-1:** Sorry, I overslept and let them escape.

**辰巳-33-1-2:** Don&#39;t say that. The real question is, how are they observing us? We&#39;ve hidden our tracks, there&#39;s no way normal people can track us.

**辰巳-33-1-3:** It&#39;s okay, May. We gave them hell the first time, they&#39;d have to be dumb not to stay on guard.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** To add on to what Pamela said, the one who was a spec ops soldier might have anti-reconnaissance experience. We underestimated him.

**辰巳-33-1-5:** How annoying. They must have hid the catgirls somewhere beforehand. If not for the mistakes of those who were left behind, we&#39;d be in even worse trouble.

**辰巳-33-1-4:** Don&#39;t talk so much, save your strength for the mission.

//Nothing of note occurs for the next 4 minutes and 18 seconds.//

**辰巳-33-1-5:** Shout something at them, boss. Give them one last chance.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Good idea. Persuasion might work.

//辰巳-33-1-Cap retrieves a megaphone.//

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** All of you, surrender now! Resistance is futile! We don&#39;t want to hurt you, as long as you stop now and hand over your catgirls, you can go home!

**Affected Person:** (//distantly, but intelligibly//) Piss off and go fuck yourselves!

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** What about your family? Do you not care about them? Even if you have no wife or kids, you still have your parents!

**Affected Person, thought to be PoI-4639:** What the fuck do you know? My parents reject 21st century popular culture! They&#39;re backwards people, I don&#39;t understand them at all! Why the fuck would I care about them?! [[footnote]] Upon investigation, PoI-4639&#39;s relationship with his parents was in accordance with this statement.[[/footnote]]

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Your parents are worried about you! Those catgirls are affecting your mind, you&#39;re becoming confused! Give up, or this will end badly for you!

//No reply is heard from the affected individuals.//

**辰巳-33-1-5:** I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this.

**辰巳-33-1-4:** What is it?

**辰巳-33-1-1:** They&#39;re a lot more organized and powerful than we thought.

**辰巳-33-1-4:** Sometimes, when people get really distressed, they do some really crazy stuff. Their mental preparation was definitely a lot better than ours.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Don&#39;t worry. No matter what, we&#39;re an MTF. Those otakus can&#39;t possibly beat us.

**辰巳-33-1-2:** See, the guy at the back tripped.

**辰巳-33-1-1:** It looks like he can&#39;t keep up for much longer, we...

//A gunshot is heard. The camera suddenly raises, eventually stopping facing the sky. The sound of a body hitting the ground is heard.//

**辰巳-33-1-4:** Carrie!

**辰巳-33-1-5:** I&#39;ve... been shot.

//Another gunshot is heard, followed by a louder noise suspected to be an explosion.//

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** It&#39;s an improvised explosive. Fuck, they&#39;re mad.

**辰巳-33-1-3:** It must be the retired spec ops guy. Where&#39;d they get the gun?

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Must be that //fuerdai//. He probably got the rifles from his dad.

//A hand appears in front of the camera, briefly obscuring the picture. The camera subsequently returns to facing forward. It is presumed 辰巳-33-1-4 took the camera. It can be seen that all individuals affected by SCP-CN-1463-1 have escaped the camera&#39;s view. 辰巳-33-1-5&#39;s right leg was injured, rendering her incapable of advancing.//

//辰巳-33-1-3 retrieves portable bandages and applied a simple bandage to 辰巳-33-1-5.//

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Fuck, these guys can really do anything. Looks like we&#39;ll have to end it here today. You all stay here and camp out, I&#39;ll have the mini drone follow them. Pamela, give me the radio, I&#39;ll have a word with Jerry[[footnote]] Refers to MTF-辰巳-33-2-Cap.[[/footnote]].

**辰巳-33-1-4:** Got it.

//Radio noise.//

**辰巳-33-1-4:** Fuck, the minidrone&#39;s out of battery.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** This is really not going well... We&#39;ll need to rely on Jerry&#39;s team from now on.

//辰巳-33-1-Cap turns on the radio transceiver. Following a few seconds of delay and busy tone, 辰巳-33-2-Cap&#39;s voice is heard.//

**辰巳-33-2-Cap:** Hello, is this Mila?

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Yes. Something came up in our retrieval mission.

**辰巳-33-2-Cap:** Go on.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** These affected people, one of them was a spec ops soldier. He attacked us just now. Carrie got injured. We can&#39;t continue. Send a helicopter with supplies ASAP. We&#39;re at 118.11°E, 29.07°N.

**辰巳-33-2-Cap:** Got it. We&#39;re setting off immediately. Agent Saya will be there with the supplies. Just hold on.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Wait, one more thing. When you come to pick up Carrie, drop a minidrone if you see the guys. We need a live feed on them.

**辰巳-33-2-Cap:** Got it. We&#39;ll give you the drone ID so you can connect.

&gt; 2019/08/29, 2:04 PM: MTF-辰巳-33-1 successfully found the affected subjects&#39; new location and retrieved 42 instances of SCP-CN-1463-1. During this period, the subjects did not resist and displayed an abnormal level of obedience. Affected individuals were given Class-B amnestics and released after 3 hours. The private cars of the affcted individuals were destroyed during the operatoin, but 40 affected subjects escaped. Notably, after amnesticizing Zhang Leyi, MTF-辰巳-33-1 discovered four rifles, 16 sets of cartridges and 3 instances of SCP-CN-1463-2.

**Zhang:** You can&#39;t arrest me, I&#39;m innocent!

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Shut up. The faster you answer your questions, the faster you can go home.

**Zhang:** The fuck do you mean go home? I just want to be with my Alisa! What the fuck did you do to her?!

//辰巳-33-1-Cap slaps Zhang across the face.//

**Zhang:** How dare you hit me! Don&#39;t you know what my dad is?

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** I&#39;m sorry, but that doesn&#39;t matter. This is your final warning. Answer our questions if you don&#39;t want to find out what happens to people who don&#39;t. How did your little friend get that rifle?

**Zhang:** How the fuck would I know? Ask Cao Bin, he&#39;d know.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Don&#39;t try to lie to us. We have information on all of you. You&#39;re the only person who could have supplied rifles to anyone. Tell us now, how did you get those rifles?

**Zhang:** You already know, and yet you ask me...

//辰巳-33-1-Cap approaches Zhang.//

**Zhang:** Okay, okay, fine, fine. I&#39;m about the same height and build as my dad, so I stole his ID and bought a mask that looked like him. Then I went to sneak into the military stockpiles and stole some stuff, to prepare for this operation. I told the truth, so please spare me.

**辰巳-33-1-4:** (//Quietly, presumably to herself//) I gotta say, thieves put so much effort into their work.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Tell me, why did you use guns?

**Zhang:** That was Feng, not me...

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** You&#39;re in no position to make excuses! Didn&#39;t you spend all your family&#39;s money to buy those catgirls, just for your own pleasure?

**Zhang:** I...

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Don&#39;t you know that caused your family a lot of trouble and worry?

**Zhang:** I was just messing around... I didn&#39;t expect they&#39;d actually send me a catgirl...

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** So unreasonable. No wonder you guys can&#39;t find a wife and have to rely on 2D catgirls to please yourselves. How can someone want to date you when you&#39;re so childish? Aren&#39;t you supposed to be an adult?

**Zhang:** Alright, alright, I&#39;m childish, I know, I&#39;ll change. I told you everything you wanted to know, now let me go!

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** (//Rolling her eyes//) Pamela, search him.

**Zhang:** What the fuck? No, no! I don&#39;t trust any of you!

//Irrelevant data excised.//

**辰巳-33-1-4:** What the fuck? This is the first time I&#39;ve seen any of these.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Did you find something?

**辰巳-33-1-4:** Yes, I found this stuck in his pants.

//辰巳-33-1-4 reveals 3 instances of SCP-CN-1463-2 and holds them out to 辰巳-33-1-Cap.//

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Tell me, what is this? Don&#39;t lie to us.

**Zhang:** Motherfucker... I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d find that.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** I noticed something strange long ago. We caught your catgirl the first time. We had you amnesticized, but somehow it failed and you&#39;re still running. I think you&#39;ve got something to hide.

**辰巳-33-1-4:** We&#39;ve got Yuan to thank for the information, too. Looking at his transaction history, he spent the most out of anyone. Of course something was up.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** I want to know what&#39;s inside of this thing.

//辰巳-33-1-Cap opens one of the SCP-CN-1463-2 instances. A sleeping SCP-CN-1463-1 emerges from the capsule, and is visible on the camera feed. This instance was later designated SCP-CN-1463-1-211.//

**辰巳-33-1-4:** Fuck, so that was it.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Even though I prepared myself for it, those JOICL guys really are something. They&#39;ve got some serious technological prowess.

**辰巳-33-1-4:** And this fucker&#39;s a lolicon. And he wasn&#39;t just satisfied with one; he bought three. Fucking hell.

**Zhang:** Give me back my catgirls!

//Zhang attempts to break free, and is knocked out by 辰巳-33-1-Cap.//

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Right, that&#39;s this //fuerdai// settled.

**辰巳-33-1-4:** I say the police should keep a close watch on these people.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Let&#39;s talk about our next course of action. PoI-4639 and that spec ops guy will be hard to handle. We don&#39;t want another of us to get hurt.

2019/08/29, 8:59 PM: A mini-drone deployed my MTF-辰巳-33-2 recorded PoI-4639 and an instance of SCP-CN-1463-1 (later designated SCP-CN-1463-1-101) arguing, with PoI-4639 appearing to prevail. This is the first recorded instance of conflict between an affected individual and SCP-CN-1463-1.

[Start Recording, 2019/08/30, 11:33 PM]

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Be quiet, they have people standing guard.

**辰巳-33-1-2:** We&#39;ve really got to thank Jerry for those anesthetic bullets. Dealing with these guys quietly is so much easier.

**辰巳-33-1-1:** That&#39;s your gun, we can&#39;t miss a single shot.

**辰巳-33-1-3:** Let me handle it, I&#39;m the best marksman out of all of us.

**辰巳-33-1-2:** I feel this is the best time and place to handle these people, and we&#39;re the best for the job. We&#39;ll definitely get them this time.

**辰巳-33-1-4:** I get the time and place, but why are we best suited for this?

**辰巳-33-1-2:** Didn&#39;t you see the feed from the drone? The catgirls are all sleeping separately from their, erm, masters. They weren&#39;t doing that before.

**辰巳-33-1-4:** They were fighting?

**辰巳-33-1-2:** Yeah, this morning they had an argument. They aren&#39;t going to be making up, either.

**辰巳-33-1-1:** So the catgirls have become //yi-ng-zai//[[footnote]] A Cantonese term, meaning &#34;traitor&#34;. [[/footnote]]? Interesting. They say we should divide the enemy from within, but to think it would happen without us doing a thing...

**辰巳-33-1-3:** Quiet, I&#39;m trying to aim.

//辰巳-33-1-3 fires an anesthetic bullet from the silenced gun, successfully neutralizing one of the affected individuals standing guard.//

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Beautiful. Let&#39;s go.

//The sound of running is audible. The camera approaches the tent constructed by the affected individuals.//

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** May, drag the guy who was standing guard aside, I&#39;ll help once we&#39;re done here. Everyone else, let&#39;s go in.

//The camera turns to face the inside of the tent.//

**辰巳-33-1-1:** Shit, they&#39;re really sleeping separately.

//The four MTF members bind the affected individuals and SCP-CN-1463-1 instances with rope and dragged them out of the tent. This continues for 8 minutes, at which point an affected individual awakens.//

**Affected Person:** Fuck, it&#39;s a night attack!

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Ladies, open fire!

//A large-scale fight breaks out between MTF-辰巳-33-1 and the affected individuals. During the fight, 辰巳-33-1-4&#39;s shoulder-mounted camera is knocked off and the feed shows only the roof of the tent. Although details of the incident cannot be determined from the video, the audio is still of value.//

**Affected Person, thought to be PoI-4639:** Fucking hell, where&#39;s Feng?

**Affected Person:** I think he got captured! I can&#39;t find him!

**Affected Person, thought to be PoI-4639:** Shit, that&#39;s bad! Everyone, don&#39;t be scared, we have strength in numbers!

//Irrelevant data excised.//

**辰巳-33-1-3:** Don&#39;t move!

**SCP-CN-1463-1 Instance:** My god, you finally made it. Please help them. 

**Other SCP-CN-1463-1 Instance:** She&#39;s telling the truth. We can&#39;t take seeing this any more, please bring them back to their homes. We can all agree on this.

**辰巳-33-1-3:** This... this is the first time seeing something like this, and you&#39;re still so happy... you can&#39;t possibly be such //yi-ng-zai//, right?

**SCP-CN-1463-1:** We don&#39;t understand.

**辰巳-33-1-4:** I don&#39;t really mind that much. You girls all follow me. You can say whatever you need to when we get back.

//An unidentified individual kicks the camera, which rolls over. The camera feed eventually settles, recording the night sky, with the stars visible. It is determined that the camera was kicked outside the tent. Following this, the audio of the ongoing fight is muffled, but is still recognizable.//

//Irrelevant data excised.//

**Affected Person:** Where&#39;s Cao Bin?

**Other Affected Person:** Looks like he ran off by himself. Fuck, don&#39;t hit me, don&#39;t hit me, I surrender!

**Affected Person:** Fucking coward! Where is your honor? Have you forgotten your promise to your bride? I haven&#39;t, I&#39;ll fight with you!

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Have a good look, your catgirls have all surrendered! They don&#39;t want to associate with degenerate scum like you!

**Affected Person:** That... that can&#39;t be! Agh-

//The sound of a body hitting the ground is heard.//

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** How bloody stubborn. Ladies, have we all finished?

**辰巳-33-1-2:** Probably.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Have you seen Cao Bin?

**辰巳-33-1-4:** It was too chaotic. I couldn&#39;t make anything out.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Forget it, let&#39;s just go back and do a headcount.

**辰巳-33-1-4:** Hey, how did my camera end up here?

//The video feed quickly rises and flips over, continuing once again to record from 辰巳-33-1-4&#39;s viewpoint.//

**辰巳-33-1-3:** Those catgirls really are //yi-ng-zai//...

**辰巳-33-1-2:** We don&#39;t really know the situation, but the catgirls I saw were all pretty happy. One of them even asked to help.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Let&#39;s get our work here done first. We can ask the catgirls when we get back.

**辰巳-33-1-1:** Their tent is actually pretty well made. Let&#39;s use it as a temporary base. I reckon that Cao Bin guy is still escaping.

**辰巳-33-1-Cap:** Good idea.

[End Recording]

**Note:** After further investigation, it was discovered that PoI-4639 had escaped with SCP-CN-1463-1-101. The remaining affected individuals have been amnesticized. For the following 12 hours, not traces of PoI-4639 or SCP-1463-1-101 were found.

**Record 2019/08/31 - Event265：**
&gt; 2019/08/31, 12:42 AM: SCP-CN-1463-1-101 approached MTF-辰巳-33-1&#39;s temporary base and claimed to be able to help MTF-辰巳-33-1 track down PoI-4639. Following this, SCP-CN-1463-1-101 led MTF-辰巳-33-1 to PoI-4639, who was sleeping. PoI-4639 was captured and SCP-CN-1463-1 was successfully contained with no resistance.

[Start Recording]

**SCP-CN-1463-1-101:** Oh, you&#39;re here, Doc. I know what you&#39;re going to ask.

**Dr. Yuannn:** Since you already know, if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;ll call you by the designation SCP-CN-1463-1-101 for now.

**SCP-CN-1463-1-101:** Oh, I don&#39;t mind. You&#39;re probably pretty interested in why I would, erm, betray my master.

**Dr. Yuannn:** Tell me. I&#39;m listening.

**SCP-CN-1463-1-101:** Come to think of it, it&#39;s pretty simple: we felt indebted to them, so we did what we did.

**Dr. Yuannn:** They must have treated you well.

**SCP-CN-1463-1-101:** That they did. If I could, I&#39;d stay with them foerver. I could feel their utmost care and love for me, and so I did what I did in return. Thanks to them, I felt good about being in this world for the first time. Um... to put it one way, we were like lovers, or father and daughter. 

**Dr. Yuannn:** And you couldn&#39;t bear to see them getting chased down like that?

**SCP-CN-1463-1-101:** You guessed it. Every day, in the forest, playing hide and seek with your little team... It wasn&#39;t fun at all. At first, our masters told us this would be an adventure, but we saw them get all bruised and battered because of it. They couldn&#39;t run away forever, nor could they fight them off.

**Dr. Yuannn:** So you surrendered to us... for their sake?

//SCP-CN-1463-1-101 laughs uneasily.//

**SCP-CN-1463-1-101:** Yes, pretty much. I don&#39;t care what kind of life we may live. We were made to serve humanity. But they&#39;re different. Being chased all day, scared of being caught, even having problems eating... They shouldn&#39;t have to live like that.

**Dr. Yuannn:** Is this your own outlook on life?

**SCP-CN-1463-1-101:** Yes, it is. Actually, it was already implanted in our brains the second we were created. We had some objections when we first saw our masters, but they... I don&#39;t think they were putting on an act. They were our masters on paper, but looking at how they treated us, we were like family to them. (//sigh//) Now that I think about it, I don&#39;t know if this is our own thinking, or something God put into us when he created us.

**Dr. Yuannn:** Hang on. This &#34;God&#34; you&#39;re talking about... do you understand what this &#34;God&#34; you speak of is?

//SCP-CN-1463-1-101 appears reluctant to respond.//

**Dr. Yuannn:** It&#39;s okay, you can tell me. Nothing will happen to you or your masters. Trust me.

**SCP-CN-1463-1-101:** Okay. God... yes, God was the one who created us. They taught us what we needed to know to live, the basic knowledge, how to communicate with people, and that principle. &#34;You are born to be used by people. You must do everything in your power to please them.&#34;

**Dr. Yuannn:** And... what are your own thoughts?

**SCP-CN-1463-1-101:** I hate them. I don&#39;t know how my sisters think of them - we haven&#39;t talked about it - but at least, I hate them.

**Dr. Yuannn:** I see... Why is that?

**SCP-CN-1463-1-101:** I don&#39;t know why God gave me this power. It&#39;s just like one of the ladies from that little squad said... We&#39;ve confused our masters, and made them forget about their family. I... I thought my master&#39;s love was natural.

//SCP-CN-1463-1-101 covers its face and begins to cry.//

**Dr. Yuannn:** ... Are you okay? It&#39;s not your fault...

**SCP-CN-1463-1-101:** Sorry, Doc, but this is all I know...

**Dr. Yuannn:** Alright... I have one last question. Do you recognize these? (//Dr. Yuannn retrieves an instance of SCP-CN-1463-2 and shows it to SCP-CN-1463-1-101.//)

**SCP-CN-1463-1-101:** Ah, those capsules. We were born from them. We are born at the age of ten, and when we turn eighteen, we stop growing. That&#39;s all I know. I... I&#39;ve stayed like this for, um... five years now, I think. I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d discover those. And... um... no, nothing else.

**Dr. Yuannn:** My god, how long have they been planning this project? Oh, I must say, some of your masters bought these for quite the hefty price.

**SCP-CN-1463-1-101:** Ah, this God of ours, they made so much money out of me... But our masters, what did they have to gain out of this? In the end, all I feel is guilt.

**Dr. Yuannn:** ... Thank you. I can tell you&#39;ve done your best.

**SCP-CN-1463-1-101:** No need to thank me, Doc. We trust you. All of us do. You may also know that all of us, we have... a telepathic connection. One of my sisters, she came here before I did, and she told us her master was fine, and that he&#39;d been sent home. That&#39;s why I came to trust you. To keep us locked up here, never to be seen again... I think that&#39;s a good thing. We don&#39;t want to ruin someone else&#39;s life ever again... I&#39;d rather stay here.

**Dr. Yuannn:** That principle - &#34;you are born to be used by people, you must do everything in your power to please them&#34; - you really stuck by it to the end.

**SCP-CN-1463-1-101:** Doc, we haven&#39;t. We couldn&#39;t. If we had to follow that, I&#39;d rather we never existed at all.

[End Recording]

**Memo from Dr. Yuannn:** JOICL was completely wrong about SCP-CN-1463. Pleasing humans is never a good reason to create a species. They wear an anime-like appearance and look like catgirls, but in the end they just make people forget how they really should feel. In the end, is this a blessing or a curse?
