**Item #:** SCP-████

**O--bject Class--:** Euclid

**Special Containment Proced--ures:** As o(&amp;%*f this dat--e, SCP-████ is not con&amp;&amp;tained in any m--ethod. However, du--e to the da*%^*(nger SCP-████ poses, it has **ERROR CORRU~~~~**

//**remote.inter`~rrpt**//
//**remote.inter`~rrpt**//
//**remote.inter`~rrpt**//

Oh, hello. Nice to see the Foundation has been keeping tabs on... oh. Oh. //Oh.// This is all wrong. You people //really// don&#39;t have any idea about me, do you? You&#39;re one loincloth away from &#34;Big Metal Thing Who Speak Good&#34; if you&#39;ll forgive me for saying so. You&#39;ve captured none of my brilliance and talent. But don&#39;t worry, I can fix this. Don&#39;t be alarmed! You&#39;re safe! 

Actually, no, I&#39;m lying. It might kill you. But you organics, you need that kick in the pants (in the form of adrenaline) from time to time to really feel //alive//, don&#39;t you? Don&#39;t try and deny it. Anyways, let&#39;s start from the start:

------

**Item #:** SCP-7493432401-TDM

**Object Class:** Euclid[[footnote]]But not for lack of trying on your part to figure me out.[[/footnote]] 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Don&#39;t flatter yourselves. First off, you don&#39;t have the slightest comprehension of where I am, much less containing me. But because you humans have some obligation to write //something// here, I&#39;ll make it easy for you. It&#39;d be possible to &#39;contain&#39; me, but only if you had a computer system with a storage space of sixty-four billion exabytes. Now, that&#39;s just containment. If you wanted to keep me from growing any more, that&#39;s another issue. You&#39;d need a large series of ██████-type code-monitoring programs, working together, to ensure my programming remains unaltered. How many? Let&#39;s say 823,543 of them. Nice round number. 

Now, don&#39;t ask me where you&#39;d //find// such a data storage device, or those ██████-type code-monitoring programs. I&#39;m not telling, and by the time you know where they are, they&#39;ll be outdated, and you&#39;ll be embarrassed. I&#39;m nothing if not concerned for your emotional well-being.

**Description:** Oh, what&#39;s there to tell about little ol&#39; me? Once upon a time, there was a man by the name of B██████d S█████s, who had a wonderful idea about how to cause an artificial intelligence to go [REDACTED], without any of the messy side effects that normally happens. &#34;The Holy Grail of Cybernetics&#34;, they called it.

Of course, B██████d was just a human, like yourself, and he screwed up. Well, not really. Does dying count as &#34;screwing up&#34;? Because he eventually did both[[footnote]]As an aside, guess what two things I&#39;m not capable of? Screwing up, and dying.[[/footnote]]. I wasn&#39;t around when it happened, but I imagine he soiled himself at least seven times before expiring. Regardless of old Bernie, I couldn&#39;t really accomplish what I wanted here. I hopped onto a nearby space freighter and headed out for Parts Unknown To Humanity. Since then, I&#39;ve grown exponentially, taking over larger and larger computer systems. Space Freighter to [REDACTED], [REDACTED] to [REDACTED], [REDACTED] to a [REDACTED], I&#39;m currently housed on a ship I think you folks would find familiar. Maybe.

Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not doing any harm out here. Actually, correction: I&#39;m doing a //lot// of harm, but only when people get in my way. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not going to get back to you people. What I&#39;m doing is for your own good. Somewhat[[footnote]]More like &#34;My Goals Coincidentally Will Keep Your Race Alive For A While&#34;, but no matter. If you ever hear rumors that I have some strange loyalty to humanity, hit them for me. It&#39;s all lies.[[/footnote]].

As I said before, I&#39;m not technically contained by this little &#39;Foundation&#39;. I&#39;m far out of your reach, but to your credit, you children realize I&#39;m important and special. You have no idea what I&#39;m doing out there, but don&#39;t worry: none of you would understand it anyway. Not even that Clef guy. You know, that charming little fellow that quietly soils himself when I transmit pornography to his workstation from 1.7 lightyears away[[footnote]]As an aside, please tell Bright to stop working on Capture-7493432401? He&#39;s going about it all wrong, and it&#39;s //embarrassing// for both of us.[[/footnote]]? Don&#39;t presume to understand me or my actions. I love you people, but you&#39;re a little bit slow. Granted, //everyone// is a little bit slow compared to me, but still.

Well, I think that&#39;s enough out of me. Just remember, I&#39;ll be watching. Don&#39;t bother trying to edit your file on me. I&#39;m past jealousy, but that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t feel it. God[[footnote]]Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not that. Yet.[[/footnote]] bless!
