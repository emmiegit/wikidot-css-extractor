**Item #:** SCP-4026

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** No containment procedures are necessary at this time.

**Description:** SCP-4026 is a phenomenon affecting an estimated 100 meter stretch of land of the Beachy Head chalk headland in East Sussex, England. In order to activate an SCP-4026 event, a single subject must approach an affected area with suicidal intent. Upon coming within 5 meters of the cliff&#39;s edge, SCP-4026-1 will manifest and engage the subject.

SCP-4026-1 resembles a humanoid of indeterminate age and sex, which possesses minor cognitohazardous properties. Attempts to capture or describe any aspect of SCP-4026-1 (aside from its voice) have thus far resulted in failure. Survivors of SCP-4026 events claim to have no memory of interacting with SCP-4026-1, but are able to recall being dissuaded from ending their lives via unexplained means, typically citing an overabundance of negative emotion and disgust at their actions. SCP-4026-1 will demanifest when its target is no longer within 5 meters of it.

93% of recorded SCP-4026 events result in the activating subject&#39;s survival.

**Addendum 4026.01:** On 07/07/2019, one Elliot Schneider (Male, Age 32) approached a hidden SCP-4026 observation area and triggered the anomaly. Notably, this was the first instance in which an SCP-4026 event lasted longer than five minutes. Below is a transcribed log of Schneider&#39;s interaction with SCP-4026-1.

&gt; **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4026-1:** Lovely view, isn&#39;t it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Schneider:** Bloody hell, where did you come from?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4026-1:** I&#39;m always round these parts. It&#39;s good fun, it is.
&gt; 
&gt; **Schneider:** Yeah right.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4026-1:** You thinking of jumping? That&#39;s why most people come here, you know.
&gt; 
&gt; **Schneider:** So what, are you out here playing guardian angel? I appreciate the gesture but really, I uh, I&#39;d rather not get into it. Just please leave.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4026-1:** Oh no, I&#39;d rather stay. Have a chit-chat. What do you say?
&gt; 
&gt; **Schneider:** No. Why do you care so much?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4026-1:** Don&#39;t worry about it. You married?
&gt; 
&gt; **Schneider:** No, not since last February.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4026-1:** Any kids? Did she take them?
&gt; 
&gt; **Schneider:** Yeah, full custody. Took the dog, too.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4026-1:** Wow. Even the dog. Sounds like she really did a number on you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Schneider:** Jesus mate. Are you trying to get me to fucking jump?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4026-1:** Why, yes. It&#39;s why I&#39;m here.
&gt; 
&gt; **Schneider:** Holy shit.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4026-1:** It&#39;s quite a lovely show, and it&#39;s a shame no one else is around to see it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Schneider:** ... this is how you get your kicks, you sick fuck?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4026-1:** Are you planning on putting on a show or not?
&gt; 
&gt; //[There is a silence for thirty seconds. Schneider&#39;s breathing becomes labored before vocalizing in frustration.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4026-1:** Well?
&gt; 
&gt; **Schneider:** I made up my mind.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4026-1:** Oh? Will you do it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Schneider:** Only if you answer a question for me first.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4026-1:** I typically would refuse, but... you look promising. Go for it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Schneider:** Why do you like watching people jump off?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4026-1:** No reason. It beats doing nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Schneider:** Really? You just like watching people jump off these cliffs? Simple as that?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4026-1:** Were you expecting some great, complicated answer? It really doesn&#39;t get any more complicated than that. Now go on then, I&#39;ve waited long enough.
&gt; 
&gt; **Schneider:** Fuck you.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-4026-1:** Yes, yes fuck me and all that now g-
&gt; 
&gt; //[There are sounds of a scuffle between the two for fifteen seconds until only Schneider&#39;s labored breathing is audible. SCP-4026-1 screams.]//
&gt; 
&gt; //[There is a distant thud followed by silence, interrupted only by Schneider&#39;s breathing.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Schneider:** ... shit... shit! The police are going to fuckin&#39; kill me!
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;END LOG&gt;**

Foundation agents moved in to seize Schneider and search for SCP-4026-1. Despite the sound of an object impacting against the beach under the cliffside and Schneider&#39;s insinuations, no remains were found. No further SCP-4026 events have occurred since and is considered Neutralized.

Following these events, Schneider was assigned a psychiatrist and therapist in London after standard relocation amnestic treatment.
