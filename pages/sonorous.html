You are a neon city, darling

filled with sparking glass-backed tubes

and clinking birds. Rest your weary head -

-so light! -

upon your gentle chest, conduct those symphonic bellows

of your lungs. Oh, I wish I could hear you clear! Your instrument breathes in tune

with the mountains, with the sea. You scarcely breathe, darling, but when you do, I would live a lifetime by your side

to hear it again.

When the night fades, so does your metal. Let me describe you again.

You are a sunrise, darling,

all edges and shadows and silhouettes, gleaming knife-edged in your blooming orchestra of colour

like a hundred burgundy flares arcing across a starfield.

You are decorated for a feast, prepared with distant planets

and a side of meteors.

And yet your head hangs heavy still. Dear, why do you not look around? Your midnight city

is suffuse with gold, a flush of rose --

not those crass red things that smell like nothing, you know,

nor those darlings of the garden breeders, putting out delicacies all year round

//rude// guests those roses are, building up their grave mounds through their heyday

petal by browning petal, caressing their self-built tombs in nameless sleep come lightest frost --

But I forget myself. Darling, you are a rose: strong, heady

as those wild roses at the beach, gripping hard-won sand and blooming

choked by salt-toothed weedkillers meant for you

and dashing still.

Sly, superior, free.

I stand before you, you neon city

you wily rose

and behold as you perfume the lilac dawn

with soundful nectar of the divine.

##fcfcfc|This was written in one shot as a piece dedicated to a &#39;painting&#39; made of thin strips of tissue paper of a thousand colours cut and folded in intricate ways over a softly glowing white panel. It produced an effect like soft, borderless stained glass. I hope to see it again soon.##</textarea></pre>
