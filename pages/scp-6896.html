**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6896 is to be kept at Site-103 in a Specialized Indoor Growth Chamber, established in an airtight 4m x 4m x 3m enclosure with an outer decontamination chamber separating it from the rest of the facility. The walls of the chamber are to be constructed of reinforced concrete, and the atmosphere inside the chamber must be cleared of gases and/or compounds that may prove harmful to SCP-6896-A, lest its self-preservation capabilities be triggered. Any personnel entering the chamber outside of approved testing are required to wear full hazmat-protection suits, and the chamber must be cleared of any potential contaminates following an approved test. SCP-6896-A must be watered once every three (3) days and kept under artificial lighting.

--No less than twelve (12) armed security personnel are to be present outside SCP-6896&#39;s chamber during designated testing.-- Testing of SCP-6896 has been suspended until further notice. If any entities are to appear in SCP-6896&#39;s chamber, they are to be immediately subdued and --placed into adjacent containment chambers-- transported to a permanent containment chamber in Site-103&#39;s Heavy Containment Sector until further notice. 

--All documents pertaining to D-Class utilized in testing of SCP-6896 must be kept in a glass document container lined with [[[SCP-148]]]. D-Class are to be terminated following an experiment, regardless of the new personality the test yields in the subject.-- Any remaining D-Class personnel who have participated in testing of SCP-6896 are to be terminated immediately. Any communications between researchers related to affected D-Class personnel are to be handled via written communications utilizing documents held in containers lined with SCP-148. 

**Description:** SCP-6896-A is genetically identical to the white rose (Rosa x alba), also known as the white rose of York. Despite its title, SCP-6896-A generally dons an assortment of colors. SCP-6896-B is the flower pot in which SCP-6896-A is contained, and is shaped like the head of a demonic, horned figure, encompassed by a chain. All attempts to remove the chain from SCP-6896-B have proven unsuccessful due to SCP-6896-B&#39;s anomalous properties. The roots of SCP-6896-A seem to be embedded into SCP-6896-B, and as such, no attempts should be made to remove it from its container. 

Once a sapient being comes into direct contact with SCP-6896-A, it will erase all traces of the subject&#39;s greatest crime or transgression from the memories of everyone aware of it. Physical and digital traces of the offense will remain, though those viewing said evidence will be unable to perceive it as such, instead seeing it as portraying alternate information or simply nothing. Psionic-inhibiting tools and materials, such as SCP-148, will successfully nullify the effects of SCP-6896-A. Memories of the D-Class&#39;s wrongdoings and associated events will be retained temporarily after viewing a document under the nullifying effect of SCP-148, but constant viewings of these documents are necessary in order to continuously combat SCP-6896-A&#39;s anti-memetic effects. In addition, those with a Psionic Resistance Index of 75 or above prove to be completely immune to SCP-6896-A&#39;s anti-memetic abilities.

A portion of SCP-6896&#39;s white petals will change color to represent the incorporated sin:

* ##black|Black## - Violence &amp; Murder
* ##green|Green## - Greed &amp; Selfishness
* ##red|Red## - Romantic and/or Sexual Offenses
* ##orange|Orange## - Apathy &amp; Carelessness 
* ##purple|Purple## - Envy and Arrogance
* ##yellow|Yellow## - Dishonesty &amp; Fraud
* ##blue|Blue## - Overindulgence
* ##pink|Pink## - Indirect Transgressions

SCP-6896-A&#39;s effect appears to work off of the individual&#39;s understanding of their sin, or more specifically, whether they genuinely perceive it as a sin. As such, SCP-6896 seems to have no effect on individuals with psychopathic tendencies, and wrongdoings perceived by the perpetrator as not being morally incorrect will not be affected by SCP-6896-A. The change SCP-6896 has on an individual is dependent on how impactful of an incident the transgression was compared to other memories. See Experiment-Log-6896-01 for a list of documented tests performed on SCP-6806-A.  

**Addendum 6896-01:** SCP-6896-A appears to have a limit of seven (7) sins at one time, and upon going over threshold, the eyes of SCP-6896-B will begin to emit a bright white light, emitting fog in a variety of colors. The fog will then shape itself into humanoid entities, designated SCP-6896-C, and the flower will revert to its pure white appearance. [[footnote]] With the exception of four petals retaining their color, indicating the continued presence of one sin. [[/footnote]] These entities will constitute characteristics pertaining to the offenses or crimes they represent, possessing the primary goal of carrying out this quality or action in full. These qualities generally determine the threat posed by each individual instance. Some, after being summoned, have demonstrated mostly passive behaviors, while others have managed to break containment immediately after manifesting. Upon completing their given objective, the entities will instantly dematerialize. The entities, while able to be subdued, are unable to be killed through any orthodox[[footnote]] Approval for testing anomalous means of termination pending. [[/footnote]] means. As such, the provision of particular items, circumstances, and D-Class in order to allow SCP-6896-C instances to complete their objective is the primary method of termination. Administered tests seem to suggest that these instances do not possess any matter, nor do they possess any weight. Despite this, the entities remain corporeal and can have forces exerted on themselves. See Experiment-Log-6896-02 for a list of documented instances of SCP-6896-C. 

**Addendum 6896-02:** SCP-6896-A has proven to be abnormally resistant, though not impervious, to physical trauma. It also possesses enhanced regeneration, gradually repairing itself from damages over time, the duration of which depending on the extent of the damages. In addition to these extraordinary qualities, SCP-6896-B will release instances of SCP-6896-C upon perceiving a threat to SCP-6896-A. The SCP-6896-C instance, regardless of its designated offense, will attempt to find the source of the danger and suppress it by an means necessary, demonstrating enhanced strength and hostility generally only presented by &#34;black-sin&#34; instances. A similar occurrence will happen if the flower is not provided with the necessary amount of water, nutrients and light for its survival, SCP-6896-C entities will aim to satisfy the needs of SCP-6896-A before reverting to their usual behaviors. SCP-6896-C instances will not demanifest during these periods, so it is critical that the safety and health of SCP-6896-A be maintained to prevent it from enacting these self-defensive measures. 

**Addendum 6896-03:** If SCP-6896-B perceives any threats to SCP-6896-A while it holds no transgressions, SCP-6896-A will absorb the sins of anyone within its immediate radius, regardless of physical contact. This works both as a defense mechanism by disorienting any sapient beings that may mean it harm, and as a method of &#34;re-fueling&#34; so that it may manifest more instances of SCP-6896-C. Despite having a predictable set of rules, SCP-6896-A will break these rules in the name of self-preservation, which may imply a sentience possessed by either SCP-6896-A or SCP-6896-B.

**Recovery:** SCP-6896 was recovered on 11/03/201█, at the University of ███████, located in Miami, Florida. A group of college students, referring to themselves as &#34;The Children of Eden&#34;, intended to use SCP-6896&#39;s anomalous abilities to &#34;free themselves from sin” and to carry out the teachings given to them from an anomalous piece of literature known as “The Garden.” In their attempt, the group brought SCP-6896 to a clearing in the university and took turns relieving themselves of their burdens, inadvertently triggering the release of SCP-6896-C instances and resulting in the deaths of all but one of the group members. In addition, the incident resulted in psychological and physical injuries of a multitude of the university&#39;s students and faculty. Amelia Chen, the surviving member of &#34;The Children Of Eden&#34;, was taken into Foundation custody the following day. An interview conducted with Amelia Chen can be accessed in Interview Log 6896-01. 

[[collapsible show=&#34;↳ Interview Log 6896-01&#34;]]
[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**__Interview Log 6896-01__**

**Interviewed:** Amelia Chen, member of &#34;The Children of Eden&#34; and Person of Interest in an incident involving SCP-6896.

**Interviewer:** Dr. Jacob Torenzo, MTF Theta-4 Researcher, Clearance Level 2. 

**Foreword:** Following the incident involving SCP-6896 at the University of ███████, a known affiliate of the group known as &#34;The Children of Eden&#34; is questioned on the origins of the anomaly and the nature of their organization.

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

**Dr. Torenzo:** Good afternoon Ms. Chen, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve already predicted, I&#39;ll be asking you about the events that transpired at your university yesterday, as well as your group&#39;s involvement in the incident.

**Amelia Chen:** I . . . I want to speak to a lawyer. 

**Dr. Torenzo:** I&#39;m afraid that particular legal preliminary is disregarded in cases involving demon-summoning flowers. It would be in your best interest to cooperate with us.

**Amelia Chen:** Why am I even here? I didn&#39;t break any laws. I didn&#39;t . . . I didn&#39;t //kill// anyone, I-

**Dr. Torenzo:** Though you and your friends were directly responsible for releasing creatures that //did// kill someone . . . //someones//. 

**Amelia Chen:** That . . . that wasn&#39;t supposed to happen. 

**Dr. Torenzo:** Well, what //was// supposed to happen?

**Amelia Chen:** Well . . . Courtney, sh-she said it would be able to free us from our burdens, from our sins.

**Dr. Torenzo:** Courtney? 

**Amelia Chen:** She was one of our group members, the one who brought the flower to us.

**Dr. Torenzo:** Do you know where she obtained the flower? 

**Amelia Chen:** Well, Courtney, she has family up in Western Germany. So she goes up to visit for a week, and comes back with a beautiful flower, mostly a pure white with some black, red and green petals–

**Dr. Torenzo:** Red, black and green? The flower only had a few blue petals when we acquired it.

**Amelia Chen:** Y-yeah, it uh, changes colors when you touch it, I think the color is supposed to represent the sin it removes. Courtney said the red petals were hers, the black and green ones were already there when she found it.  

**Dr. Torenzo:** Intriguing, did she mention where in Germany she obtained the flower?

**Amelia Chen:** Well, from what I remember, some flower shop that she stumbled across, she never gave a name. 

**Dr. Torenzo:** Alright then, now, can you tell me about the flower?

**Amelia Chen:** Well, when I first saw the flower, it felt like it was emanating purity, and after seeing what it did for Courtney, we hoped it would do the same for us.

**Dr. Torenzo:** What exactly did the flower do to Courtney?

**Amelia Chen:** Well, I&#39;m not exactly sure, but from what I can tell, it removed . . . or more accurately, absorbed . . . her greatest sin. She said that it felt freeing, to be freed of her greatest burden, and the rest of us wanted the same. It was exactly what we&#39;ve been looking for. 

**Dr. Torenzo:** Being freed from your sin by removing your memory of it? That doesn&#39;t sound very freeing to me. Our mistakes can certainly weigh on us, but they&#39;re what allow us to do better in the future, they make us who we are, and contribute to our strengths as much as our weaknesses. To rid of them is to rid of a part of yourself.

**Amelia Chen:** No. You . . . you don&#39;t understand. We //have// to be pure. It&#39;s humanity&#39;s greatest purpose, to reach perfection. 

**Dr. Torenzo:** As far as I can understand, you were an excellent student at the university you attended. Sophomore with a 4.0 GPA, pursuing environmental engineering, engaged in an internship program at Bio-Blueprints Incorporated, you seem to have your life in order. This obsession of yours was non-existent until your affiliation with the Children of Eden.

**Amelia Chen:** . . . 

**Dr. Torenzo:** Can you tell me a little more about this group of yours?

**Amelia Chen:** . . . 

**Dr. Torenzo:** Ms. Chen, please, the more you help us, the more we can help you.

**Amelia Chen:** . . . So . . . the Children of Eden was just um, the name of the club that my study group and I formed. Jasmine came up with the name, she is . . . //was// . . . the leader of our group. She said that the name came to her, like intuition, sometime after she found the- um, never mind. 

**Dr. Torenzo:** Come on now, what did Jasmine find?

**Amelia Chen:** Well, she found this book, it was called &#34;The Garden&#34;. She showed the book to us, said it was the most valuable thing she found. I wasn&#39;t exactly sure what she meant by that until after she showed the book to us. It was enlightening, full of everything holy and pure and divine. I discovered a purpose I didn&#39;t know I had, to become pure, whatever the cost. 

**Dr. Torenzo:** Is this book still in your possession?

**Amelia Chen:** Jasmine held onto it. Or, maybe more accurately, she became possessive of it. She wouldn&#39;t let us see it outside of our group meetings, and hid it somewhere only she would find it. Guess she didn&#39;t trust us as much as I thought. 

**Dr. Torenzo:** I see. Can you remember the contents of the book?

**Amelia Chen:** Sort of, it feels less like reading and digesting information, and more like being transformed by the words on the page, or having parts of yourself unlocked. There was one particular line that&#39;s been stuck on my mind since, it went, um, [MEMETIC HAZARD EXPUNGED].

**Dr. Torenzo:** Oh . . . oh I see. I . . . yes. I understand now. I apologize for the inconvenience Ms. Chen. Please, wait one moment.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Closing Statement:** Dr. Torenzo, after abruptly ending the interview, proceeded to relay the memetic hazard to the rest of his colleagues. Eventually, Site Director Max Hardy called in MTF Eta-11 (&#34;Savage Beasts&#34;) to contain a potential auditory cognitohazard. Upon discovering its origin, it was determined that &#34;The Garden&#34; may be an anomalous and memetically hazardous form of literature capable of effectively brainwashing individuals into becoming associated with the organization known as the Children of Eden (GoI-015). MTF Chi-9 (&#34;Page Turners&#34;) have been tasked with discovering and containing any instances of &#34;The Garden&#34; which may exists. The affected personnel, along with Amelia Chen, were given amnestic treatment and kept under observation for a period of 48 hours. After this period, it was considered safe for the afflicted personnel to return to work. Amelia Chen has been released, remaining under the supervision of Agent Mason Ridge of MTF Eta-77 (&#34;Spheres Within Spheres&#34;) until further notice. MTF Theta-4 (&#34;Gardeners&#34;) have been tasked with the discovery and acquisition of any additional SCP-6896 instances in the wild.

**Note:** Three tests were conducted but not fully documented as a result of SCP-6896&#39;s anomalous capabilities. The D-Class personnel involved in these tests, after being subjected to SCP-6896&#39;s anti-memetic effects, would be perceived by the researchers, security personnel, and themselves as ordinary citizens, baffling all parties involved. Attempts to identify the true identity of the subject would generally fail, as documents pertaining to the individual would omit all information related to the subject&#39;s transgression, and therefore their subsequent trial, imprisonment, and incorporation into the D-Class population. Testing would reveal no anomalous qualities in the affected individuals, and as such, the subjects often ended up being amnesticized and released. It was not until operatives of MTF Eta-10 (&#34;See No Evil&#34;) were requested to investigate the presence of a possible anti-memetic entity that the discovery of SCP-6896-A&#39;s main anomalous properties were discovered and effective countermeasures were implemented.

**__Experiment-6896-01__**
**Subject:** D-9302, incarcerated for driving under the influence of alcohol, resulting in an accident that caused the deaths of the three pedestrians. 
**Motive:** Subject claims he had lost his best friend to suicide the same day, and had began heavily drinking as a coping mechanism.
**Test Purpose:** Presumably to confirm the anomalous properties of SCP-6896
**Result:** Four of SCP-6896-A&#39;s white petals change to orange. All persons involved become unaware of the subject&#39;s D-Class status. Subject amnesticized and released. 
**Additional:** It was noted that the subject seemed to lack any signs of depression when discovered following the test, and despite his confusion upon finding himself in Foundation custody, presented himself as upbeat during subsequent questioning. This contradicts his mood prior to the incident resulting in his imprisonment. It is hypothesized that the subject felt more guilty for his friend&#39;s suicide than he did the lives lost later that day, and therefore, this was the moment chosen by SCP-6896 to remove. Because his friend&#39;s lost contributed directly to his drinking, and his drinking led to his crime and imprisonment, all these details were removed from the memories of the subject. 

**--Experiment-6896-01-- __Experiment-6896-02__**
**Foreword:** --Four more of SCP-6896-A&#39;s petals seemed to have changed to orange following Timothy Greene&#39;s random and unexplained appearance in Foundation custody. Reasoning for this, and whether the incidents are connected, is unknown.-- It has been determined that a previous test took place, but was erased from the memories of the researchers as a result of SCP-6896-A&#39;s anti-memetic effects. 
**Subject:** D-3054, incarcerated for being directly involved in a string of bank robberies that occurred across Brooklyn, New York. 
**Motive:** The subject desired to complete a series of successful robberies before fleeing to Switzerland, living comfortably with the money they&#39;ve acquired.
**Test Purpose:** To confirm the anomalous properties of SCP-6896
**Result:** Four of SCP-6896-A&#39;s petals changed from white to green, though no significant changes seem to have been made to the subject, nor have any of the &#34;demonic&#34; instances observed at the university appeared. Upon questioning, the subject appeared to feel no different than he did prior to the test. 
**Conclusion:** Results mostly inconclusive. The only thing that is known is that the color of SCP-6896-A&#39;s white petals changed upon contact with the subject, as mentioned by Ms. Chen during her interview. It is believed that the four orange petals present before the test appeared as a result of Timothy Greene coming into contact with SCP-6896-A, --though how he appeared in Foundation custody remains unknown--.
**Additional:** Perez&#39;s most rewarding heist, the robbery of Brooklyn&#39;s Bank of ███████, seems to have been completely erased from the memories of all those aware of it. This effect was not identified until after countermeasures to SCP-6896&#39;s anomalous effects had been implemented. The reason the subject continued to be perceived as a D-Class seems to be because, despite his greatest heist having been erased from the memory of everyone aware of it, his numerous other heists still had a significant impact on his eventual arrest and procuring of D-Class status.

**__Experiment 6896-03__** 
**Subject:** D-8193, incarcerated for impersonating his twin brother and acquiring his assets upon his death. Whether the subject had contributed to his brother&#39;s demise is unknown. 
**Motive:** To acquire the wealth of his brother. Subject holds a resentment towards his deceased brother, and displayed very little remorse for stealing his brother&#39;s name. 
**Test Purpose:** Presumably to determine the extent of SCP-6896&#39;s anomalous abilities. 
**Result:** Four of the flower&#39;s petals changed to a mix of yellow and green. Again, the subject was seen as a normal citizen rather than a D-Class personnel, questioned, tested for anomalous capabilities or influence, amnesticized and released. 
**Additional:** If the subject who comes into contact with SCP-6896-A has committed a crime fitting into multiple of SCP-6896-A&#39;s given &#34;categories,&#34; the petals on the entity will don a mix of the colors representing those categories. 

**__Experiment 6896-04__**
**Subject:** D-9384, incarcerated for the murder of another resident at the apartment complex where he resided. 
**Motive:** Subject appeared to have no connection or ill-will towards the victim, though the subject was known for consistently being under the influence of illegal mind-altering drugs.
**Test Purpose:** Presumably to determine the extent of SCP-6896-A&#39;s anomalous capabilities.
**Result:** Four of SCP-6896&#39;s petals had become blue. Subject questioned, studied and then released as in previous cases where the subject had only committed one major transgression. 
**Additional:** The petals were believed to have been turned blue to represent hostility and murder, but after studying the SCP-6896-C instances that appeared after Experiment 6896-08, it appears that blue represents overindulgence. Whether the subject saw this as the greater of the two transgressions, the subject&#39;s memory or perception of the murder had been blocked out as a result of being under the influence of drugs, or the subject was actually innocent of the murder remains unknown. 

**--Experiment 6896-02-- __Experiment 6896-05__** 
**Subject:** D-1029, incarcerated for using the online dating platform &#34;Tinder&#34; to lure unsuspecting young men to their deaths. 
**Motive:** Subject demonstrates psychotic tendencies. Upon being questioned on the reason for her actions, she claimed she &#34;loved watching the light leave their love-struck eyes.&#34;
**Test Purpose:** To determine the extent of SCP-6896-A&#39;s anomalous capabilities. 
**Result:** SCP-6896-A demonstrated no anomalous activity upon direct contact with the subject. Experiment terminated.
**Conclusion:** Results once again inconclusive. Subject claimed feeling no different after contact with SCP-6896-A. It is possible that SCP-6896-A&#39;s color-changing properties require the individual who comes into contact with it to be capable of feeling remorse for their actions. 
**Additional:** SCP-6896-A&#39;s anti-memetic abilities also seem to rely on the subject believing they possess a transgression or sin to obscure, and therefore will only be effective when the individual is capable of perceiving their actions as immoral. 

**--Experiment 6896-03-- __Experiment-6896-06__**
**Foreword:** Regarding the recent incidents of civilians appearing randomly in SCP-6896&#39;s containment chamber, consultants from MTF Eta-10 (&#34;See No Evil&#34;) and Lambda-5 (&#34;White Rabbits&#34;) have been requested to investigate the possibility of SCP-6896-A possessing anti-memetic properties and/or presenting space-time anomalous abilities.
**Subject:** D-4920, a teacher who was incarcerated for murder after one of his students had confided in him that they were being stalked on their walk home. The subject had confronted the stalker later that day, resulting in a physical altercation which ended in the subject brutally beating the stalker to death. 
**Motive:** It seems the subject did not have any intention of murdering the victim until the victim began showing signs of hostility upon being confronted.
**Result:** Four of SCP-6896-A&#39;s petals changed from white to red. Those questioning the subject claimed that the subject&#39;s somber demeanor had diminished greatly. The subject did not deny committing the murder, but did become much less accepting of the consequences of his actions, insisting that what he did was in complete self-defense.
**Conclusion:** SCP-6896-A, in addition to once again changing color, seems to have changed the subject&#39;s perception of the crime he committed, though in what way is still uncertain. The subject doesn&#39;t seem to perceive the details of the incident any differently, but his attitude towards it has change quite significantly. More testing is required.
**Additional:** Based on the information obtained from the SCP-6896-C entities, red seems to represent lust. The subject was previously married, but was caught in an affair with another woman, leading to his eventual divorce. It is believed that the subject viewed this incident as a more significant offense than his crime. The guilt lifted from him upon contact with SCP-6896-C would account for his altered mannerisms.

**__Experiment-6896-07__**
**Subject:** D-1430, incarcerated for hiding in the back of his employer&#39;s car and suffocating them with a chain.
**Motive:** The subject was laid off from his place of employment three days prior to the murder. 
**Test Purpose:** To test the effects of SCP-6896-A on a subject who has committed only one major transgression.
**Result:** The subject, as in previous undocumented tests of a similar nature, appeared confused as to where he was. Implemented countermeasures utilizing SCP-148 were successful in inhibiting SCP-6896-A&#39;s anti-memetic influence on documentations. Despite losing all memories of the crime he committed, it could not be ensured that the subject would not kill again were a similar circumstance to arise. Subject terminated. 
**Conclusion:** SCP-6896-A possesses anti-memetic properties, and upon a subject coming into direct contact with the entity, it will remove the memories of a subject&#39;s greatest crime or offense from everyone aware of it, along with the offense&#39;s subsequent consequences. Flower petals changed to black, which seems to contradict the results of both Experiment-6896-04 and Experiment-6896-06, where the petals turned blue and red, respectively, upon an individual convicted of murder coming into contact with the entity. More tests necessary to understand the reasoning behind this apparent contradiction, and whether the colors presented really mean anything. 
**Additional:** It has been determined that black petals represent transgressions of murder and violence, and that red and blue represent different transgressions than originally believed.

**__Experiment-6896-08__**
**Subject:** D-4729, incarcerated for the murder of up-and-coming actor Franklin Slater. 
**Motive:** The two seemed to be acquaintances, attending the same fitness center. The subject gradually became jealous of his victim&#39;s physique, fame, and wealth over time. The subject began stalking Slater, until eventually poisoning him by depositing arsenic into his food at a public diner.
**Test Purpose:** To test what would happen if a non-psychopathic individual were to come into contact with SCP-6896-A when it did not possess any white petals.  
**Result:** As expected, the subject, upon having his greatest transgression removed from memory, expressed significant confusion. Shortly after the subject&#39;s contact with SCP-6896-A, the eyes of SCP-6896-B began to glow white, and semi-humanoid entities, designated SCP-6896-C, were released from the vase. One of the instances attempted to terminate D-4729 before being subdued by the security personnel present outside the chamber. Instances were subsequently taken to containment chambers adjacent to SCP-6896’s enclosure and studied, the findings documented in Experiment-Log-6896-02. All of SCP-6896-A&#39;s petals reverted back to white, followed by four of its petals donning a black-violet appearance. 
**Conclusion:** SCP-6896-C instances appear once a subject comes into contact with SCP-6896-A when it has no remaining white petals. As SCP-6896 possesses twenty-eight petals, and four are affected when the flower comes into contact with a subject, it can be determined that SCP-6896-A is capable of incorporating seven transgressions at one time, before they are released in the form of SCP-6896-C instances. The anti-memetic effects of SCP-6896-A persisted following this incident.

**Note:** Every instance of SCP-6896-C is unique in appearance, with the exception of the devil-like tail and horns that each possess, the color of which correlates with one of the colors present on the petals of SCP-6896-A. 

**__SCP-6896-C-01__**
**Foreword:** Due to SCP-6896-C-01&#39;s enhanced capabilities, it could not be contained before demanifesting. The following information was collected from eyewitnesses and security footage. 
**Description:** SCP-6896-C-01 appears to be capable of absorbing the light that hits it, giving it a pitch-black appearance, with the exception of its green tail and horns. The entity has demonstrated remarkable speed, flexibility and agility, managing to evade the security personnel responsible for detaining it following its initial appearance.
**Behavior:** The instance proceeded to make its way through the facility, bypassing locked Foundation doors and seizing the most valuable items it could find.[[footnote]]Fortunately, Site-103 does not contain any SCP objects SCP-6896-C-01 would consider valuable or obtainable.[[/footnote]] After taking a variety of different objects for a period of about 4 minutes, SCP-6896-C-01 demanifested, leaving behind the things it acquired. 
**Additional:** The entity, corresponding with SCP-6896-A&#39;s green petals, has been determined to represent greed. 

//It is critical in future testing of SCP-6896-A for the test subject to have not been incarcerated for crimes involving infiltration or exfiltration, it is simply too dangerous to have an entity capable of these operations loose in the facility. – Researcher Isabella Giselle//

**__SCP-6896-C-02__**
**Description:** SCP-6896-C-02 has the appearance of a slim and twitchy humanoid of indeterminate race, age and gender. The entity&#39;s pupil and iris in both eyes seemed to have been replaced by a multicolored spiral, which enables the entity&#39;s anomalous abilities.
**Behavior:** SCP-6896-C-02&#39;s main desire is to ingest any form of hallucinogen it is capable of acquiring. Upon being detained, the entity consistently made attempts to bribe and/or persuade the security personnel into providing it with known hallucinogenic drugs, requests including LSD, DMT, PCP, and Ketamine. Upon making eye contact with the entity, the security personnel began to display signs of psychosis, experiencing hallucinations and displaying paranoid and agitated behaviors. Amidst the chaos, SCP-6896-C-02 escaped and made its way through the facility, inducing psychosis in the site personnel it encountered. It eventually made its way into a on-site greenhouse filled with non-anomalous botanic organism. Any plants coming into contact with SCP-6896-C-02 would be converted into hallucinogenic and psychoactive herbs. Identified herbs include cannabis, jimsonweed, salvia, opium poppies, and peyote. The subject then proceeded to ingest several of the converted plants until eventually demanifesting. 
**Additional:** The entity, corresponding to the blue petals of SCP-6896-A, has been determined to represent overindulgence. 

//The researchers and personnel who observed the incident claimed that it did not seem that the entity intentionally induced psychosis in its victims, as it would never actively attempt to look into the eyes of those around it, only doing so in evasive action. Still, it is my belief that the wisest course of action would be to cease all testing of SCP-6896, as its unpredictability presents an evident threat to the Foundation, especially to a facility possessing light-to-moderate defenses such as Site-103. – Researcher Isabella Giselle//

**__SCP-6896-C-03__**
**Description:** SCP-6896-C-03 took the appearance of Theta-4 Commander John Hathaway.[[footnote]]Who at the time of the incident was assisting Site-104 botanical personnel in the maintenance of SCP-628.[[/footnote]] This was not discovered until the entity demanifested in the middle of a conversation with Dr. Glastonbury. 
**Behavior:** SCP-6896-C-03 manifested out-of-view of the present security personnel and researchers. The phoney Hathaway claimed to have made an early return from Site-104, and possessed a significant amount of information about Foundation operations. Mr. Glatonsbury stated that SCP-6896-C-03 behaved very similarly to Commander Hathaway, but had a demeanor that seemed &#34;off&#34;. The entity possessed information pertaining to Site-103&#39;s contained SCPs, containment, and Theta-4 operations, but appeared to be abnormally hesitant in engaging in topics related to Hathaway&#39;s personal affairs. SCP-6896-C-03 had on his possession identification and access cards identical to that of Commander Hathaway. Upon its demanifestation, it was revealed the entity had in its possession several Level-4 classified documents.
**Additional:** The entity, corresponding to the green-yellow petals of SCP-6896-A, represented both greed and fraudulence. 

//As this is the second incident of an SCP-6896-C instance gaining access to classified Foundation intelligence, I implore that we cease all testing of SCP-6896. – Researcher Isabella Giselle//

**__SCP-6896-C-04__**
**Foreword:** After multiple incidents resulting from other SCP-6896-C instances, it was decided that D-Class should be the only personnel allowed to interact with these entities.
**Description:** SCP-6896-C-04 is a slender and pasty humanoid of indeterminate race, age and gender. It appears to lack anatomical features necessary for human sensation and perception, most notably the eyes, ears, and nose. Closer inspection and testing have revealed it to also be missing a tongue and any sensory receptors. The entity appears to be in a state of degeneration, possessing a withering body in addition to rotting teeth and gums. The entity wears stained and worn clothes, in addition to effusing an odor described by the researcher team as &#34;sickeningly abhorrent.&#34; 
**Testing:** Despite its condition, SCP-6896-C-04 appears perfectly capable of locomotion and navigating its surroundings. All attempts to procure the attention of the entity will fail. Individuals attempting to grab the attention of the entity will gradually become more depressed and more persistent on obtaining the entity&#39;s attention until they inevitably take their own life, as was the case with the D-Class subject assigned to the entity. The entity demanifested immediately following the incident. 
**Additional:** The entity, corresponding with SCP-6896-A&#39;s orange petals, has been determined to represent apathy.

**__SCP-6896-C-05__**
**Description:** SCP-6896-C-05 appears to be a meager humanoid possessing substandard qualities. The entity is shorter, frailer, and seemingly less intelligent than the average individual, and detainment of the instance proved to be easily accomplished. 
**Behavior:** D-0291 was ordered to interact with SCP-6896-C-05. In their subsequent conversations, the entity displayed an increasing amount of disdain towards the D-Class subject, consistently mentioning how the subject was &#34;Always trying to prove he was better&#34; or was &#34;compensating for something.&#34; Eventually, the instance cease all conversation with the subject, and D-0291 was returned to his containment cell. Approximately 12 hours after the interaction, SCP-6896-C-05 disappeared from its cell. Shortly after, D-0291 began to complain that SCP-6896-C-05 was watching him at all times, disappearing from view when the subject attempted to focus on it. Attempts of outsiders to observe SCP-6896-C-05 proved unsuccessful. D-0291 became increasingly more paranoid, claiming that the instance appeared more and more often. The subject died of arsenic toxicity approximately 6 hours after SCP-6896-C-05&#39;s initial appearance, and it is presumed that the instance demanifested shortly after. 
**Additional:** The instance, corresponding to the purple-black petals of SCP-6896-A, represents both violence and envy. 

//We are fortunate that the new security measures were put in place, anyone on SCP-6896&#39;s research team could have met the same fate. The anomalous abilities of the SCP-6896-C instances have proven almost impossible to predict and defend against. If we continue working with SCP-6896-A, and more of there instances manifest, we could risk the loss of numerous Site-103 personnel. – Researcher Isabella Giselle//

**__SCP-6896-C-06__** 
**Description:** SCP-6896-C-06 bears the appearance of an attractive, male humanoid. The instance dons a well-tailored suit with black dress gloves and shoes. 
**Behavior:** SCP-6896-C-06 possesses a passive demeanor, and showed little to no resistance when security personnel escorted him to his containment cell. The instance attempted to flirt with the female security personnel during transport to its containment cell. The instance appears to display some psionic ability, as females, including those with no romantic or sexual attraction towards men, found themselves allured by SCP-6896-C-06&#39;s charms. SCP-6896-C-06 displayed no activity after its confinement. If the objective of the instance is similar to the nature of the offense it represents, there is no practical or ethical way to get it to demanifest. As such, the instance will remain in a permanent humanoid containment cell until further notice.
**Additional:** The instance, corresponding to the red petals of SCP-6896-A, represents lust. 

**__SCP-6896-C-07__**
**Description:** SCP-6896-C-07 is concealed in a full-body cloak, and proves too dangerous to inspect further. Both of its hands appear to have been replaced by steel chains. The instance emits no sounds, with the exception of the clank of its chains when it attacks.
**Behavior:** SCP-6896-C-07 proved to be the most violent of the SCP-6896-C instances, attacking the security personnel tasked with containing it immediately upon detecting them. Its primary method of attack is using its chain, which it wraps around its victims in an attempt to suffocate them. The instance appears to have abnormal strength and was capable of holding its own against multiple security personnel before being detained. The entity had to be held in a heavy containment cell due to the enhanced strength it possesses. Upon realizing it could not damage the walls of its containment cell, the entity proceeded to pace around its space. As the entity seems to not pose a threat while in its cell, no further action is to be taken at this time.
**Additional:** The instance, corresponding to the black petals of SCP-6896-A, represents violence.

**__Incident-6896-01__**
After the initial set of SCP-6896-C instances were observed, testing continued on SCP-6896-A. Upon once again surpassing SCP-6896-A&#39;s limit, the entity released instances of SCP-6896-C as normal. However, a &#34;black-sin&#34; instance, absorbed by SCP-6896-A from a D-Class subject incarcerated for murderer, detonated during transport[[footnote]] The instance seems to have waited until it was far enough from SCP-6896-A and its containment chamber to detonate. This implies that SCP-6896-C instances are incapable of carrying out actions that could prove harmful to SCP-6896-A.[[/footnote]] to its permanent containment cell, resulting in the demanifestation (deaths?) of every other SCP-6896-C instance, along with the losses of several security personnel and three researchers.[[footnote]]Esmerelda Booking, Danielle Pastings, and Thomas Giselle[[/footnote]] It has been determined that SCP-6896-C instances present too great of a threat, and that all testing into SCP-6896 is to cease immediately.

//Giselle has been placed into administrative leave following the unfortunate loss of her brother, though the incident seems to have left her with a disdain of both myself and the Foundation as a whole. It is my recommendation that a psychiatrist be summoned to the site to evaluate Giselle&#39;s mental state. If it is revealed that Giselle cannot recover from the incident, or that she poses a threat to herself or the Foundation, that she undergo amnestic therapy and be provided with a new life outside of the Foundation. - Site Director Max Hardy//
