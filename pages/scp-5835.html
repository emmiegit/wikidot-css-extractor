**Item#:** SCP-5835

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment of SCP-5835 can only be achieved through the designation of a human subject in Foundation custody as SCP-5835-A (currently, D-69273 at Site-59 has been designated SCP-5835-A-27.)

In the event of SCP-5835 being released from SCP-5835-1, either through a Forgiveness Event or the subject&#39;s death, a new host is to be designated through the following procedure:

# A D-class staff member will be selected.[[footnote]] As of Incident-5835-51, in which Junior Researcher Jacobs was killed when a SCP-5835 manifestation interrupted her maintenance check of the SCP-████ enclosure, only D-class personnel are to be used as SCP-5835-A. [[/footnote]]
# The candidate will repeat the statement &#34;Yellow is the ugliest color in the world, and I wish I could never, ever, ever see it again.&#34; (This statement has been determined to be the most effective in initiating SCP-5835-A.)
# Following the initial SCP-5835 manifestation event, the SCP-5835-A instance will be given preventative anger management seminars to ensure long-term containment.

**Description:** SCP-5835 is a tutelary parasite[[footnote]] &#34;...while none of these types of reality-bending entities can be traced back to a single source, tutelary parasites all share a common purpose: defenders of abstract concepts from dissent. Though apparently omniscient, their potential for direct hostility is limited...&#34; Dr. Isaiah Henderson, __Advanced Classification of Reality Benders__, 1987 [[/footnote]] that takes the form of a male domestic canary[[footnote]] //Serinus canaria domestica// [[/footnote]]. It is capable of speech and answers to the name &#34;Mr. Cadmium Charleston Conrad Cole the Canary-Colored Canary, Esquire&#34;, or &#34;Cadmium&#34; for short.

SCP-5835 appears only when a human subject expresses a desire to no longer see the color yellow. When this happens, SCP-5835 will manifest before the human subject, remove their ability to perceive yellow, then disappear. (The location of SCP-5835 between manifestation events is unknown.) Subjects have described yellow objects appearing to be white or gray.

While the perception of the color yellow is not necessary for human life[[footnote]] It should be noted that Junior Researcher Jacobs became an instance of SCP-5835-A by writing this article. [[/footnote]], SCP-5835 will continue to manifest before the subject, harassing them with facts about the color and its apparent importance. During this time, the subject is designated SCP-5835-A. 

SCP-5835 will continue its binding to SCP-5835-A until either the apology or death of the subject. Multiple instances of SCP-5835-A cannot exist at the same time. 

Additionally, as demonstrated by SCP-5835-13 and corresponding behavioral citations, SCP-5835 is unaffected by blunt-force trauma and gunfire.

&gt; &lt;Begin Log&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Mundy:** Read from the sheet of paper.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-29583:** Um... &#34;I hate yellow.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Mundy:** Use the exact wording.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-29583:** What?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Mundy:** Your cooperation is mandatory.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-29583:** I said I hate yellow. This says basically the same thing. The fuck&#39;s your problem?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Mundy:** You need to -- [hesitates.] Actually, fine. Use that energy, really //resent// the color.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-29583:** Sure. Fuck yellow. Yellow&#39;s a piece of shit. I hope someone comes along and kicks yellow in the dick.
&gt; 
&gt; [SCP-5835 manifests.]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835:** Tweetle-y-woo and howdy-doo!
&gt; 
&gt; **D-29583:** Uh...
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835:** &#34;Uhhh,&#34; yourself! The name&#39;s Cadmium! When I looked in the mirror this fine //yellow// morning, a little birdie told me that you got a problem with the best color in the ding-dang world!
&gt; 
&gt; **D-29583:** I mean, I was just saying what that guy over there told me to--
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835:** Oh, excuses, excuses! You dug this hole with your own two hands, mister -- and by golly-gee-whillikers, you&#39;re gonna //stew// in it! I&#39;ll grant your wish -- no more yellow for you!
&gt; 
&gt; [D-29583 becomes SCP-5835-A-16. SCP-5835 disappears.]

&gt; 
&gt; **Time:** 13:40 EST
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;begin log&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; [SCP-5835-A-16 eats from his provided lunch tray. SCP-5835 manifests on his mashed potatoes.]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835-A-16:** Oh, fucking Christ--
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835:** Whatcha eatin&#39;? In the wild, knowing what the color of your food means can even save your gol-dern life!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835-A-16:** Get off my food. Now.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835:** Sure thing! But first, pop quiz: what am I standin&#39; on? Is it mashed potatoes? Hominy grits? Mac &amp; cheese? Tappity-oka?
&gt; 
&gt; [Approx. ten seconds of silence.]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835:** ...answer, please.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835-A-16:** It&#39;s oatmeal, now fuck off.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835:** Wrong! It was mashed potatoes all along! Perhaps if you had an expanded color spectrum, you could have --
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835-A-16:** Go. Away.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835:** //Toodle-oo!//
&gt; 
&gt; [SCP-5835 aggressively defecates on the mashed potatoes, then disappears.]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835-A-16:** [incoherent screaming]
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;end log&gt;

++++ Final Manifestation

&gt; **Date:** 7/25/2017
&gt; 
&gt; **Location:** Site-59, D-Class block, Cell 1594
&gt; 
&gt; **Time:** 01:45 EST
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;begin log&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; [SCP-5835-A-16 sleeps in his cot. SCP-5835 manifests on his nose.]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835:** Havin&#39; a dream?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835-A-16:** [stirring from sleep] ...huh?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835:** Notice anything different? Anything... missing? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835-A-16:** //I&#39;m trying to fucking sleep!//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835:** But since you hate yellow //so much//, I thought I&#39;d take away all the marigolds and dandelions from your dreams! Oh well, suppose you won&#39;t miss &#39;em anyway!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835-A-16:** Look, I don&#39;t even hate yellow anymore. I hate //you. GO AWAY!//
&gt; 
&gt; [SCP-5835 hums to indicate thinking for approximately 15 seconds. SCP-5835-A-16 feels around for his shoe.]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835:** Well, I suppose I //could// bring yellow back. Left hand on your heart, and your right hand raise, and solemnly swear as I solemnly say&#39;s!
&gt; 
&gt; [SCP-5835-A-16 moves his hands as indicated.]
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835:** Do you swear, on everything good and yellow, that you&#39;re gonna love the color of bees and honey and lemons and bananas for as long as you shall live, and never again sully its name with such a disgusting wish as the one you made to have it disappear, So Help You //Jaune?//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835-A-16:** Yes. Fine.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835:** And the next time you see a bright little tulip of the yellow persuasion, your heart will aflutter with the happiest of pitter-patterings, for it is now your favoritest of favorite colors?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835-A-16:** Sure. I swear. Are we done here?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835:** And if yellow ever comes up to you, can it do whatever it wants to your mind, body, life, soul, and feelings? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835-A-16:** Yes, I -- wait, what?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5835:** //Tweetle-y-dee!//
&gt; 
&gt; [SCP-5835 demanifests in an explosion, causing minor facial burns to D-29583.]
