[[tab Special Containment Procedures]]
SCP-4621 is currently uncontained within the Black Forest of Germany and is to be classified as Keter upon successful containment.  Its last known location was outside of Feldberg. SCP-4621 is to be reclassified a Keter-level threat until further notice.

All forest fires created by SCP-4621 are to be contained with minimal involvement of local fire services.  MTF-β-6 (&#34;Flower of Battle&#34;) is to engage with SCP-4621 as appropriate to keep it away from population centers.  Personnel who are not experts in hand-to-hand combat are not to approach SCP-4621 under any circumstances.   
[[/tab]]
[[tab Previous Special Containment Procedures]]

SCP-4621 is to be contained in a secure locker within a standard humanoid containment chamber in Containment Site-812.  SCP-4621-1 is to be furnished with their preferred weapon of choice in a non-lethal form, and access to foundation combat instructors for the duration of containment. At this time, no access to SCP-4621 is to be taken by anyone other than SCP-4621-1.  A Zartion-Diaghilev Somnambulus Apparatus is to be used to view and record dream sessions for further study and catalog.

[[/div]]
[[tabview]]
[[tab Current Description]]

SCP-4621 has been reclassified as the hostile entity formerly described as SCP-4621-2.  SCP-4621 is a hostile humanoid entity composed of fire and plasma, occurring in a solid state through unknown anomalous means.  SCP-4621 is hostile to all humans and will attempt to terminate any persons approaching its line of sight.  SCP-4621 has heretofore always been observed to be wielding a German-style longsword.  
[[/tab]]
[[tab Previous Description]]

SCP-4621 is a leather-bound manuscript copy of &#34;The Flower of Battle&#34; by Fiore DiLiberi with significant alterations, formerly owned by the D&#39;Angelo family in Teora, Italy.  SCP-4621&#39;s primary anomaly manifests as a hostile entity (hereafter referred to as SCP-4621-2) within a recurring dream/nightmare of the affected subject (hereby after referred to as SCP-4621-1). SCP-4621-1 will invariably have the same recurring nightmare of a burning building, in which they are chased by a hostile entity.  SCP-4621-1 is selected by the first living human touching SCP-4621 without a current SCP-4621-1 subject. 

This entity has been described universally as a burning humanoid figure wielding a German longsword typical of the 15th century.  SCP-4621-2 will attempt to chase down SCP-4621-1 and terminate them within the dream world.  This is invariably fatal to the subject.  After being terminated by SCP-4621-2, SCP-4621-1&#39;s body will begin to burn, and over time immolate their surroundings.  The fire produced via this effect burns between 713 and 812 degrees C, and presents a significant difficulty to extinguish, and will re-originate from the body shortly after being extinguished.

This effect ceases upon the acquisition of a subject as SCP-4621-1.  If SCP-4621-1 manages to evade or defeat SCP-4621-2, the subject will wake with no ill effects beyond mild fatigue, and general complaints of a lack of restful sleep. 

See Addendum 2 for additional details of SCP-4621.

[[tab D-22647]]
**Subject #:** 13
**Subject Name:** D-22647
**Duration of Successful Containment:** 1 week
**Containment Notes:** D-22647 had significant training in hand-to-hand combat, and was considered an expert in knife combat before their acquisition by the Foundation.  D-22647 successfully contained SCP-4621-1 for six nights before being forced into a physical confrontation with SCP-4621-2.  D-22647 lasted approximately the equivalent of six real-time seconds before being terminated by SCP-4621-2.  

//Hand-to-Hand combat skills do not necessarily transfer over.  Further subjects will need skills more closely matched to SCP-4621-2&#39;s.//
//-Dr. Giannaris//

[[tab Andrej Kowalczyk]]
**Subject #:** 16
**Subject Name:** Andrej Kowalczyk, Former Lt. of MTF-β-6 (&#34;Flower of Battle&#34;) 
**Duration of Successful Containment:** 342 days
**Containment Notes:** Lt. Kowalczyk was incarcerated by The Foundation following the discovery of the addiction to an illicit demonarcotic substance.  Since his ingestion, Lt. Kowalczyk has displayed symptoms of extreme withdrawal consistent with stimulant and opioid withdrawal.  Attempts to treat these symptoms with chemical therapies have proven ineffective.  Lt. Kowalczyk was recommended by Captain Giancarlo DeLuca for assignment to this containment detail due to his extreme competence in hand-to-hand combat, specifically in Japanese fencing. 

Lt. Kowalczyk&#39;s recordings can be viewed under Video Evidence Tag #0F3445A67. Lt. Kowalczyk contained SCP-4621-2 for 342 days; See Addendum 1.

[[collapsible show=&#34;▶ Transcript of Journal excerpts from Andrej Kowalczyk&#34; hide=&#34;Close Transcript&#34;]]
&gt; 
&gt; Containment, Day 1:
&gt; 
&gt; They offered me a second chance.  I know I fucked up, but I don&#39;t know if I can even lift my sword anymore.  Every time I try to wrap my hand around the handle, my hand shakes so bad she falls out of my fingers.  All I can do is try.  They&#39;re making me keep this journal for &#34;research purposes&#34;.  Whatever, enjoy reading about how fucked my hands feel, doc.
&gt; 
-----
&gt; 
&gt; Containment, Day 2:
&gt; 
&gt; Things are...different in the dreams.  I can move like I&#39;m used to, the cravings are gone.  I&#39;m not sure if the docs are just pumping me full of the shit or what, but when I find my sword, it&#39;s like it used to be.  The smooth cloth under my fingers.  The nicks in the tsuba.  I feel like myself again.  The first time I crossed swords with &#34;it&#34;, it was clumsy.  I managed to defeat it relatively quickly.  The next morning I felt...good.  
&gt; 
-----
&gt; 
&gt; Containment, Day 28: 
&gt; 
&gt; I think it&#39;s learning.  The moves that worked before no longer work.  It gets its sword in the way at the last moment now and manages to counter some of my motions.  When I wake up, my arms hurt.  I feel like my fingers are burning now.  The doctors say that the addiction isn&#39;t getting worse, but it&#39;s not getting better.  It probably never will.
&gt; 
-----
&gt; 
&gt; Containment, Day 134:
&gt; 
&gt; All I can think about is the fucking Ash.  They said the addiction isn&#39;t getting worse, but it just won&#39;t fucking stop.  My hands are basically useless, and they&#39;re feeding me at meal times now.  Giancarlo came by to see me a few weeks ago.  He said he was proud of my progress and for rising above the Ash.  I feel like such a fucking failure, he doesn&#39;t even realize I&#39;m falling apart. I haven&#39;t risen above shit.
&gt; 
-----
&gt; 
&gt; Containment, Day 341:
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m sorry Giancarlo.  I can&#39;t take it anymore.  I&#39;ll never hold my sword again, and he&#39;s getting better every goddamned night.  I&#39;m so tired. So shaky.  I just can&#39;t take it anymore.  Thank you for believing in me.
[[/collapsible]]

Lt. Kowalczyk did not attempt to defend himself on the 342nd day of containment.  SCP-4621-2 had demonstrated significant improvements in its combat ability over the course of the time that Lt. Kowalczyk contained it.  It&#39;s estimated that SCP-4621-2 would have overpowered Lt. Kowalczyk within the next month.

++++ __**Addendum 2: Transcription of SCP-4621**__ 
[[/div]]



Transcription of the extra sections of SCP-4621 is available as a contiguous story of the fencing master Fiore Dei Liberi traveling through the German states during his study of the European schools for the writing of Fior di Battaglia.  It&#39;s hypothesized that SCP-4621 is the original manuscript of Fior di Battaglia.  The story is recounted as three encounters with an unnamed Germanic nobleman.  
[[collapsible show=&#34;▶ First encounter with &#39;The German&#39;&#34; hide=&#34;▼ close transcription&#34;]]
I found myself, as I usually do, roaming the countryside looking for some Masters of the Arte with whom I can either improve my own skills or offer my services as a fencing master. 

I happened upon a manor within which was a young lord, and his son.  I offered my skills as a fencing master to pay for a few more weeks travel.  I was informed there was already a fencing master in residence and decided to pay my respects to another wandering swordsman.

I met The German in the parlor of the man&#39;s house, sipping upon some victual and relaxing before a fire. I introduced myself, giving my full name and profession.  I asked where he studied and received quite an odd answer. 

I offered to have a friendly bout to determine if we could learn from one another.  With padded blades or the Academy if he felt it was appropriate. He relented to this bout after much plying with words and wine, which I found odd as well.  

On the next morrow, I found out his reticence.  The German had little skill with a blade, and whatever he taught to the young Lord&#39;s son was of no quality.  I handily dispatched him on the pitch, and the young Lord dismissed him out of hand.  I cannot abide fakers and cheats and took no pity on watching him thrown out of the manor.

I stayed at this house for several weeks, taking food and supplies with me after instructing the young Lord and his son in the arte for as long as they had time for such diversion.  
[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show=&#34;▶ Defeat of &#39;The German&#39; in the Lichtenhaur Academy&#34; hide=&#34;▼ close transcription&#34;]]
Betimes I find myself approaching a school of the Arte of some renown.  I try and pay my respects to the Master of the school, and offer whatever insights I may have in exchange for their own into my technique.  

I found myself at the famed Lichtenhaur academy, a place I honed my own skills before penning this manual.  Fond memories brought me back to the halls of the academy, where the ringing of young blades provides a constant chorus.  Master Lichtenhaur himself, of course, had long since retired, but his first apprentice had gladly taken over instruction in the Arte.

I was surprised to find The German as I&#39;ve come to think of the fraudulent fencing &#39;master&#39; I&#39;d encountered before in residence as a guest instructor.  I approached the Master of the school and informed him of my observations from my past encounter, inquiring if he&#39;d become more skilled.  The Master informed me he was accepted on the recommendation of several other fencing masters, and he had not had the time to test his skills himself.

The next morning, The German was called to demonstrate a simple Oberhau, to show the students why the Roof was such a deadly stance within the Germanic Arte.  His form and understanding were less than rudimentary.  

In a rage, he accused me of conspiring to disgrace him, calling my honor in to question.  His defeat was swift and total, before the assembled school. 

Once more, I took no pity on him as he was thrown out of his residence, built upon fraud.
[[/collapsible]]
[[collapsible show=&#34;▶ Death of &#39;The German&#39; within Hausach&#34; hide=&#34;▼ close transcription&#34;]]
I found myself at a manor house in Hausach, at the invitation of a local Magistrate whose children were interested in pursuing a military commission and wished them instructed in a foreign arte in order to improve their breadth.

The pay I was offered was generous, and I set off immediately from my previous employ after finishing my tutelage to a satisfactory degree. I was brought in to the manor with open arms.  The young men to instruct appeared able and ready to learn.

Several days passed with instruction going in a favorable fashion. Upon my second week of instruction, I was informed that there would be a banquet for several guests, and my host pressed upon me to regale them with tales of my travels.  I readily agreed, it was not such an unreasonable request.  As etiquette demanded, I came unarmed, which brought me to a surprise.  The German was apparently the guest of honor, armed and fully ready for battle.  

I found myself armed with only my belt knife and my wits.  The Magistrate&#39;s young sons were similarly arrayed against me.  I find that young men overly appreciate their blades, and neglect their brawling and grappling.  Had they let me teach them for several more weeks, the young man guarding the door would have kept his shoulder in its socket, and his sword arm intact.

As I recovered my arms from my quarters, I smelled the acrid tang of smoke upon the air. As I entered the house again, sword aloft, The German stood in front of me guarding the door.  Flames had begun to lick up and down the frame of the house.  

The German believed he could defeat me, as we had clashed twice.  I do not take pleasure in the cutting down of the untrained, but in this case, I was gratified to remove this pretender from the earth.

I can still remember the curse flying from his lips as I dispatched him.  This is the last memory of that dabbler, may he be forgotten forever.

++++ __**Addendum 3: Re-classification of SCP-4621**__ 
[[/div]]

Following the death of Lt. Kowalczyk, Cpt. Giancarlo DeLuca petitioned to be allowed to contain SCP-4621-2.  As a practitioner of the Liberi school of Italian swordsmanship, he was uniquely qualified to contain SCP-4621-2 .  While initially opposed by the containment director, a direct override by Director Diaghilev and Commander Donnarson allowed him to take up the post.  Cpt. DeLuca spent exactly one night containing SCP-4621-2.

Of note, the Zartion-Diaghilev Somnambulus produces transcriptions through the subject&#39;s stream of consciousness.  As such any mistakes, divergences, or word choice is purely based on the subject&#39;s mental description of their dream-state.  

[[collapsible show=&#34;▶ Output of Zartion-Diaghilev Somnambulus Apparatus log&#34; hide=&#34;▼ Close Transcription&#34;]]

&gt; BEGIN AETHERIC TRANSCRIPTION...
&gt; @@==========================================@@
&gt; Cpt. DeLuca gains &#34;consciousness&#34; within the burning building, and immediately finds his sword on the floor next to him.  He holds it in front of him and advances slowly through the halls towards the foyer.  Down near the entrance, SCP-4621-2 waits for Cpt. DeLuca.
&gt; 
&gt; Cpt. DeLuca cautiously advances down the stairs, keeping his sword in front of him the entire time.  SCP-4621-2 appears transfixed, his eyes locked on to Cpt. DeLuca&#39;s sword.  Cpt. DeLuca reaches the bottom of the stairs, and stands across from SCP-4621-2, in a defensive stance, detailed as &#34;Tutta porta di ferro&#34; (full iron door). 
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-4621-2: LI...BERI.
&gt; 
&gt; Cpt. DeLuca: You can speak? 
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-4621-2 advances towards Cpt. DeLuca.  Cpt. DeLuca waits for a half moment, then steps to his left, raising his sword to intercept the Oberhau from SCP-4621-2.  He completes the motion, bringing his sword across in a parrying motion, and striking at SCP-4621-2&#39;s back.  
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-4621-2 emits a high pitched sound.  Within SCP-4621&#39;s containment chamber, SCP-4621 begins to vibrate within its containment locker.  
&gt; 
&gt; Cpt. DeLuca and SCP-4621-2 exchange several more blows, with Cpt. DeLuca wearing SCP-4621-2 down.  With the approval of the containment director, SCP-4621&#39;s locker is opened.  SCP-4621 has begun to smolder. 
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-4621-2: NEVER AGAIN!
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-4621-2 lunges at Cpt DeLuca who moves in a complex series of steps ending with his sword sweeping through SCP-4621-2&#39;s torso.  SCP-4621-2 dissipates, as per usual on its defeat, but Cpt. DeLuca does not immediately wake. 
&gt; 
&gt; SCP-4621 has burst completely into flames in the real world, destroying SCP-4621 despite the use of fire suppression systems. Cpt. DeLuca&#39;s unconscious body is moved out of the containment chamber. Cpt. DeLuca awakens several hours later.
&gt; 
[[/collapsible]]

After these events, an entity matching SCP-4621-2&#39;s description was sighted in the Black Forest in Germany, leading SCP-4621-2 to be reclassified as SCP-4621.  Cpt. DeLuca is no longer classified as SCP-4621-1.
