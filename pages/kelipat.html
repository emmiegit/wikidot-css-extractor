[[size 125%]]**SCPF Project Proposal**[[/size]]
[[/=]]
**FROM:** Dr. Judith Low
**TO:** Overwatch Command
**DATE:** November 09, 2019
**RE:** The Kelipat Nogah Initiative.
----
The threat represented by the growing strength of the Sarkic cults cannot be underestimated. While long thought to have been rendered ineffectual by their long persecution at the hands of the Church of the Broken God, it has become clear in recent months that the Sarkic Cults are not as toothless as once believed.

While we have known for quite some time that the Sarkic cults represent the remnants of a once-unified and powerful state, we were mistaken in believing that they were ever truly defeated. The conflict that we now call the War of the Flesh was devastating in both its reach and impact. We now estimate that that conflict alone was responsible for the deaths of upwards of 30 million people, and was the likely cause of the Bronze Age Collapse. 

This war represented one of the single most catastrophic events in human history and had the net effect of drastically reducing the population in a way that we have yet to fully comprehend. Whole genetic lineages that may have represented entirely different branches of //homo sapiens// were wiped off the planet in a mere handful of years.

The impact of this conflict cannot be understated, as a modern equivalent would be nothing less of global nuclear war. 

It should be noted that if the Sarkics were ever able to attain the level of sophistication and organization that gave rise to the Kalmaktama Empire, the world as we know it would be forever changed. Let us not kid ourselves, the Foundation and other international organizations are not ready to face a threat of this magnitude, and if such a threat truly does exist, they have had millennia to plan and prepare for every possible response.

My proposal is simple. The apparatus of the Foundation is already in place throughout the world to begin moving against the Sarkic cults that we know about. Up until this point, we have been mostly content to let sleeping dogs lie, but I believe the time has come to dramatically increase our efforts in containing the Sarkic contagion. We are finding more and more offshoots of the Sarkic tree every day, and many of the groups we are locating have already had centuries to set down deep roots.

Project Sitra Achra was a good test bed for how well the Foundation can interact with elements of both the [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/church-of-the-broken-god-hub Church of the Broken God] and the [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goc-hub-page Global Occult Coalition]. Those surviving Project personnel could be easily reassigned to the Initiative and would serve as an experienced veteran core, one that would provide excellent resources in training and outfitting a full-scale Initiative such as this. 

We know the threat, now we must act on it.

**Date:**  2019/11/11 @ 11:02
**Present:** O5-01, O5-02, O5-03, O5-04, O5-06, O5-07, O5-08, O5-09, O5-11, O5-12
**Virtual:** O5-05, O5-10
**Absent:** O5-13
**Agenda:** //The Kelipat Nogah Initiative.//
-----
[BEGIN LOG]

**O5-01:** I don&#39;t think this will take very long, but I thank you all for attending. I assume that everyone&#39;s had a chance to look over the impact study provided by Dr. Low?

**O5-12:** I believe so. I find it concerning that none of us have been aware of the extent the Sarkic threat poses until now, however.

**O5-08:** I disagree. We&#39;ve heard rumblings from those flesh cultists before, this is nothing new. I think that Dr. Low is either working too hard and seeing threats where there are none, or this is just a blatant power grab. Frankly, I am more inclined to believe the latter. She&#39;s gone too-

**O5-12:** //[interrupting]// That&#39;s enough. This is neither the time nor the place for you to bring up your past issues with her. Your animosity blunted the success of Project Sitra Achra and we all know it. 

**O5-08:** Sitra Achra was a mistake. Giving that much access to the GOC was a mistake. We&#39;ve got a tenuous enough relationship with the UN, and allowing them to get an even better understanding of the scope of our operations has only emboldened the elements in the UN that want to shut us down.

**O5-03:** Oh come on, Eight. You may think that your position on Overwatch grants you unlimited power, but that&#39;s not what the Charter is for. Your blustering and belly-aching doesn&#39;t-

**O5-08:** I didn&#39;t come here to be insulted by someone who only pretends to be my peer.

**O5-01:** //[Gavel]// ENOUGH. Bickering amongst ourselves won&#39;t solve a damn thing. The fact of the matter is is that Dr. Low is merely the messenger here. All of her analysts agree, the independent analysis provided by Twelve&#39;s Overwatch Committee also agrees. The Sarkic threat has gotten too big to ignore, and something must be done.

**O5-12:** My analysts do agree that-

**O5-08:** Of course they would.

**O5-12:** Look. You may resent Dr. Low, and you may resent my position within this body, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that I am a member of this body, and it sure as hell doesn&#39;t change the fact that these reports exist. Did you even read them?

**O5-08:** To be frank? I didn&#39;t bother. Dr. Low has been fear mongering ever since she got her promotion to L03. This so-called &#34;Sarkic Threat&#34; of hers has been a dirge she&#39;s been playing for years, and quite frankly, I&#39;m tired of it. We&#39;ve poured hundreds of millions of dollars down the Sitra Achra drain, and I&#39;m done with it. 

**O5-03:** That&#39;s rich, coming from you. How much money got pumped into SCP-████ before we decided that it just wasn&#39;t going to do what you want, despite how much you wanted it to?

**O5-08:** So now we&#39;re gonna talk about that? What about SCP-

**O5-01:** //[Gavel]// Gentlemen, please. If either of you step outside the scope of this meeting again, I will have you censured. By a show of hands, who here has actually read the report provided by Dr. Low?

//[The sound of rustling and movement can be heard.]//

**O5-01:** That is more than enough to meet quorum. Call the vote.

||~ YEA  ||~ NAY  ||~ ABSTAIN ||
||O5-01  ||O5-02  ||O5-13 ||
||O5-03  ||O5-04  ||          ||
||O5-06  ||O5-05  ||          ||
||O5-09  ||O5-07  ||          ||
||O5-10  ||O5-08  ||          ||
||O5-12  ||O5-11  ||          ||

**O5-01:** With deadlock, the motion is tabled until O5-13 is available to cast their vote. If there is no other business-

**Administrator:** The Charter states that in the event of a deadlock, I may cast the deciding vote.

**O5-01:** Yes sir. I didn&#39;t think that you-

**Administrator:** //[Interrupting]// Just because I decline to vote more often than not doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t keep myself informed, One. Twelve, you have faith in Dr. Low&#39;s assessment. I have faith in you. However, Eight raises a good point. I&#39;m not willing to dump unlimited funds into this //Kelipat Nogah// Initiative of hers without assurances that it&#39;ll pan out. 

**O5-12:** Oh, I understand that, sir. I assure you that-

**Administrator:** //[Interrupting]// To that end, I will authorize a paired-down version of what Dr. Low has proposed, and I&#39;m making you Overwatch over the entire project. If this turns out to be a pipe-dream as Eight is convinced it will be, it will cost you your seat on this council. Is that clear?

**O5-12:** Yes, sir. 

||~ YEA ||~ Nay ||~ Abstain ||

|| || || Motion Passes ||

**Note:** With the force projections associated with the ever growing Sarkic Threat, Xi-8 has been reorganized. This Organization Chart has been depreciated and replaced with the one listed above.

**Primary Specialty:** Acquisition and/or termination of Sarkic entities and artifacts
**Command:** Commander Malachai ben Liraz

**Overview:** //Made up by a core group of Project: Sitra Achra personnel, Xi-8 is uniquely suited to external threats posed by the Sarkic Cults. Each member of this MTF has undergone extensive training in counter-occult initiatives, and is well-versed in Sarkic history.//

----
**Effectiveness Projection:** //With the inclusion of Paraspecialists provided by the GOC and the CotBG, Xi-8 should now be able to handle most, if not all mid-level Sarkic Infestations. While not yet the ideal as laid out by Dr. Low, this is a good first step.//
