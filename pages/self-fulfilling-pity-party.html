The pansies were in bloom at Site-∞&#39;s gardens; alone, I went to see them. Pansies are Davis&#39; favorite flower. I stare at them as they trigger memories in my mind. My stomach churns. It&#39;s been a year, and I still can&#39;t get over our breakup. Right after our break-up, I used [[[SCP-5746]]] to observe our future... would we even be friends?

Watching the bees buzz around the flowers, I remember why I felt drawn to the gardens today. This was the day I had seen. My heart feels like it&#39;s on fire and my eyes threaten me with tears. Davis and I are even further away than I had seen. I didn&#39;t realise this while using the machine. I guess some data does get lost. 

Anyway, I haven&#39;t done anything about our friendship have I? I&#39;ve barely talked to him, I&#39;ve barely tried hanging out with him, I&#39;ve just... barely tried at all. I&#39;ve been assuming that maybe our future is fixed to happen, that what I observed is fixed.

Except, I could&#39;ve chosen to ask Davis if he wanted to go to the gardens with me. Except, I could&#39;ve stayed in the lab today. There are many other things I could&#39;ve chosen to do, but I chose to go to the gardens... based off of the forecast? I&#39;ve been down on myself, and fulfilled my own prophecy. I could&#39;ve done something different, I had a choice.

During me and Davis&#39; relationship I had been too involved in my work. It wasn&#39;t that Davis felt jealous, but moreso he understood that a relationship involves work on the part of both parties. It means sacrificing things sometimes at the behest of your partner, or friend, or relative, or co-worker, etc. Davis works a lot in the lab as well; he&#39;s deeply interested in the machine&#39;s use of the astral plane. But it was like I lived in the lab, whereas he lived in the dorms.

I should&#39;ve seen the signs sooner that I was overworking and preferring a relationship with my work rather than Davis. One of the first tests on the machine yielded a forecast about my death. Agent Eris has seen my death set to occur during a fire drill. //A drill.// How boring and mundane. 

My death was supposed to happen in the early morning while I was sleepless in the lab. Eris had seen me fall asleep while ascending the five floors, and had tried to help me. I suppose that&#39;s part of the give and take of the machine. We can only observe the future. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-stitch-in-time-saved-mine We can&#39;t engage with the timeline, only observe.] 

Eris reported that the fall was what killed me.

The morning of this test, security show up outside the lab and escorted me all day. Davis had even given me the message &#34;to get some rest&#34;. I did go to sleep that night in my dorm, but also security made sure I didn&#39;t leave my dorm.

Things like this should&#39;ve been the first indications that our relationship was suffering...

...and then I forgot his birthday.

If the temperament of the relationship was better, a forgotten birthday would be forgivable. I feel his reaction would&#39;ve been petty under different circumstances. He informed me the next day that he didn&#39;t want to be in a relationship. Merely because I had forgotten his birthday. 

But...again... if the circumstances were different his reaction would&#39;ve come off as petty. This was not the case. I had clearly been overworking myself and neglecting //all// of my relationships. Lapine had made the comment to me a few times to &#34;go see a movie&#34; and &#34;take the day off and go to the gardens or something.&#34;

Too little, too late, I visit the gardens. Too little, too late, I fulfill my self-fulfilling pity party. I watch the bees bumble around the flowers. Do they choose to pollinate the flowers? No they don&#39;t. They have a queen, instincts and pheromones that demand they pollinate the flowers. However, a bee isn&#39;t a person. I can choose when to do my work, I can choose my own path. I can choose Davis.

&#34;Thank you bees,&#34; I turned and left the gardens. Would Davis be free for coffee?

------

I started talking to Davis again, and hanging out with him. We hung out during our lunch breaks. It&#39;s been stop and go, but he&#39;s been warmer and nicer toward me. Although the other day, in the observational room, Davis was clearly flirting with Researcher Strep. My stomach felt cold, and my chest burned. I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s flirting with Strep as a slight, or he&#39;s gotten over our break-up?

I shouldn&#39;t risk my job again to use the machine, but I don&#39;t know what else to do. Will we even have a friendship a few decades from now? Or will Davis just be someone I used to know?

To be honest, I think I&#39;ll take my chances. I need some sort of finality to our relationship, and I need to stop fixating on this... but... I... I don&#39;t know. I need finality. This will be the last time I use the machine for my own selfish gain.
