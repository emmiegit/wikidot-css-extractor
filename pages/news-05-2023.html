[[/div]]

As of April 11th, Sigma-10 officially went live. Sigma-10 is the new visual theme for the SCP Wiki which brings to the forefront new body and header fonts as well as an improved SVG logo!

The body font and SVG logo were looked upon as general accessibility and quality-of-life adjustments and were met with little disagreement. The header font was another matter.

Initially, there was a concern that the old //Bauhaus// font for the header may not have been compatible with the site licensing. Due to this, some of the initial framings of the proposed changes were based on this matter. Further discussion cast doubt on that original concern and the Tech team decided to propose the change from //Bauhaus// to the //Sans Normalcy// font on an aesthetic basis as opposed to licensing one. The staff team voted and accepted the new change.

We also have a survey we&#39;d like you to take regarding the new theme! You can find it [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQBiescQWRq7EPalayJqf-9BSr3nXPECXgUW4vlvdbHs5onw/viewform here!]

+++ Reviewers&#39; Spotlights

Works are featured on the site’s front page as part of the Reviewers’ Spotlight, which acknowledges the time and effort spent by forum reviewers helping other authors develop and edit and their works for the mainsite. Each month, community members are encouraged to nominate forum reviewers who have been both particularly helpful and active. Members of the Forum Criticism Team will then discuss the nominations, and select four prominent reviewers to choose the month’s Reviewers’ Spotlight front-page features.
