**Item #:** SCP-3875

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation webcrawlers and embedded agents will monitor civilian communications for reports consistent with SCP-3875 activity. This monitoring focuses on locations which are both informationally dense and open to the public, such as libraries, museums, bookstores and hobby or gaming retail locations. If the presence of SCP-3875 is noted, a Foundation front company which specializes in pest control will be dispatched to eliminate any egg sacs or juveniles at the target location. They must be accompanied by either a member of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#toc30 MTF Sigma-3] (&#34;Bibliographers&#34;) if any are available, or else an agent with a CRV score of 15 or above who has been trained and equipped in accordance with SCP-3875 acquisition protocols. 

Personnel who encounter uncontained SCP-3875 should avoid revealing their affiliation with the Foundation. SCP-3875 regard the Foundation as hostile, and will cease communication and withdraw immediately if such affiliation is known. If necessary, it is acceptable to &#34;trade&#34; non-sensitive information for more information about SCP-3875&#39;s activities as a delaying tactic while awaiting the arrival of agents properly equipped for containment. 

SCP-3875-1 is to be kept in a standard small animal containment chamber equipped with a Scranton Reality Anchor. Their diet consists of six live crickets per week and approximately 4000-6000 words of previously unread written material. Experimentation has proven this to be sufficient to ensure good health while minimizing the risk of escape. The anomaly has expressed a preference for works of fantasy and speculative fiction; these may be used as a reward for good behavior. If testing which involves direct interaction with researchers has recently been performed, the amount of written material may be correspondingly reduced or eliminated at the Senior Researcher&#39;s discretion.

Due to the inaccessibility of SCP-3875-0 (referred to by SCP-3875 instances as TentedBeams), the Foundation&#39;s long term strategy involves the containment of adult SCP-3875 instances, and termination of juveniles or egg sacs whenever possible. It is theorized that if this reality is deemed inhospitable by SCP-3875-0, she will cease to deploy her offspring here. 

**Description:** SCP-3875 is a species of sapient spiders which resemble the //Salticidae// family of arachnids (commonly known as jumping spiders). However, adult SCP-3875 are significantly larger, with body lengths ranging from 6 to 10cm. Juvenile SCP-3875 are more difficult to identify prior to their first molting, sharing the median 1mm body length common to non-anomalous //Salticidae//. 

SCP-3875 are insectivorous and passively infovorous,[[footnote]]Many infovorous anomalies erase information they consume. Passive infovores, by contrast, derive nourishment from absorbing knowledge that is new to them, and do not alter or delete information when consuming it.[[/footnote]] and rapidly decline in health when deprived of one or the other. Juveniles are passively infovorous, but do not exhibit the other anomalous qualities of SCP-3875. They may seek out high density data sources such as libraries or server stacks to feed until they mature. Juveniles absorb information indirectly through mere proximity; adult instances lose this ability and must obtain information through direct sensory experience or telepathy.

Adult instances are capable of telepathic communication within a range of 6 meters. Testing has confirmed that the other party must be aware of SCP-3875&#39;s presence and intend communication for this ability to function. Some instances are also able to exert a temporary antimemetic effect with the same radius, which obscures their own presence. This antimemetic effect is used primarily as a defense mechanism.

SCP-3875 instances seek out and initiate conversation with humans, and reportedly other sapient entities, in order to trade in information. The information offered by the targets might be anything the anomaly considers to be of interest; the information offered by SCP-3875 may be mundane or anomalous. When engaged in such transactions, SCP-3875 have been observed manipulating strands of web in their forelegs. Researchers have not yet concluded whether this activity is related to SCP-3875&#39;s capacity for instantaneous inter-reality information sharing, or merely a form of artistic expression similar to knitting.

When replete with information, an SCP-3875 instance can manipulate reality to create a trans-dimensional rift (also known as a &#34;Way&#34;) sufficient to transport itself into another reality. The most common origin and destination reported by uncontained instances is the Location of Interest known as the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/wanderers-library#pages Wanderer&#39;s Library]. SCP-3875-1, prior to containment, reported this as the permanent home of SCP-3875-0 and asserted that she is the progenitor of all SCP-3875. Other instances Foundation personnel have been able to interview invariably support this assertion. 

SCP-3875-1 has been partially cooperative while in containment. They have demonstrated the operational limits of their antimemetic effect and physical mobility, but refused to offer further information regarding other instances&#39; locations or activities. SCP-3875-1 has repeatedly expressed willingness to trade information regarding uncontained anomalies, as well as locations and persons of interest. The fact that they were able to accurately describe objects of the Foundation&#39;s interest is considered confirmation of the anomaly&#39;s information-sharing capabilities. For this reason, further research along these lines has been deemed an unacceptable security risk.

**Recovery:** Agent Ruby Farmer was on assignment investigating the movements of PoI-███[[footnote]]A reality bender whose anomalous abilities include the use of cognitohazardous kinetoglyphs.[[/footnote]] at a university library in Rockford, Illinois. 

Upon noting the presence of SCP-3875-1, the agent activated her lapel camera, capturing the following video log. SCP-3875-1&#39;s statements were made telepathically. These were reconstructed later from Agent Farmer&#39;s debriefing.

&gt; **Recovery video log transcript** 
&gt; **Date:** 2013/10/11
&gt; 
&gt; [BEGIN LOG]
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Farmer&#39;s camera is activated. SCP-3875-1 emerges from behind a lamp onto the desk surface of a study carrel.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Farmer:** Yes, I wish to trade information. My name is Ruby; what&#39;s your name?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3875-1:** Aha! Name exchange to demonstrate good faith. Trade commences. I am HitchWebCrouch.
&gt; 
&gt; //This designation was communicated as a series of movements, echoed by corresponding visible movement of the arachnid. The agent&#39;s report stressed that the verbal description is an approximation only.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3875-1:** What knowledge do you seek, friend Ruby? Tactics, travel guides, syllabi?
&gt; 
&gt; **Farmer:** I&#39;d like to know a bit more about you, if that&#39;s all right. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3875-1:** Hmm. Acceptable! For this, I ask to know the nature of this facility, its intended purpose and who may use it.
&gt; 
&gt; //Dialogue in which Agent Farmer describes the normal operations of a university library has been cut for brevity. At the conclusion of this exchange, the arachnid bows, extending a foreleg.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3875-1:** My thanks, friend Ruby. I say in trade: my siblings and I are valued citizens of the Wanderers&#39; Library. We crave knowledge above all things, and in shared understanding exchange this knowledge with wanderers and citizens of the worlds, for joy and profit. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farmer:** And you&#39;re all siblings? You don&#39;t find a nice world where you&#39;d like to settle down -- start your own family, your own business?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3875-1:** Aha! I clarify: as siblings, we trade in __shared understanding__. The children of TentedBeams in all worlds may now say that any non-hostile human may enter this library and read its books, but scholars known to its guardians may take books elsewhere for deeper study. Further, among human scholars such as yourself, friend Ruby, this protocol is considered commonplace.
&gt; 
&gt; //Another bow and a small dance from the entity.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3875-1:** Thus, should you request syllabi which are even now being assembled among the shelves, I may provide. At upcharge.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; //There is a brief pause, during which Agent Farmer activates a silent alarm built into her wristwatch. This alerts agents stationed at a nearby surveillance van that a containment team should be dispatched if she does not return within a pre-arranged time period.// 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farmer:** I... I see. Could you explain what you mean by &#34;syllabi?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3875-1:** Aha! Yes. I clarify: Library patrons access information. This is observed. When one develops knowledge which obtains renown, we assemble syllabi from their research. Shelf locations are also available, at upcharge.
&gt; 
&gt; **Farmer:** That&#39;s fascinating. I&#39;ve never been to the Library myself. Almost nobody from around here travels elsewhere. Not too many even know it&#39;s possible.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3875-1:** A generous offer of local history! What shall you learn in exchange?
&gt; 
&gt; **Farmer:** Who does the observing and assembling you mentioned? You said your family is spread out through all the worlds. Which worlds, and who decides who gets to leave? Seems like a lot of work for the ones who have to stay home.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-3875-1 extrudes a length of thread and briefly manipulates it with their forelegs.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3875-1:** Hmm. Generosity for generosity. Our mother sends eggs into promising worlds, but most of us are born within the Library. Many choose to remain for the length of their lives; those who wish to wander, do so. At home, we observe patrons, and catalogue shelves when business is slow.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-3875-1 does a small dance, and flutters their pedipalps.// 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3875-1:** I say free: business is rarely slow.
&gt; 
&gt; **Farmer:** Thank you, that definitely answers my question! Friend - sorry if I say this wrong - friend HitchWebCrouch, I&#39;d love to buy a syllabus, but I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have that much valuable information on me right now. Would you mind coming out to the parking lot? I&#39;ve got some equipment stored there I think you would find interesting.
&gt; 
&gt; //The arachnid climbs to the top of the study carrel and peers out the window. Beyond a small group of student housing units, a large parking lot is visible in the distance.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3875-1:** Agreed. Friend Ruby, if this would be comfortable, would you provide transport?
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Farmer extends a hand.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Farmer:** I&#39;d be glad to. Climb aboard.
&gt; 
&gt; //The agent holds the arachnid close to their chest, attempting to shield it from the sight of other patrons. SCP-3875-1 waves a foreleg and begins to speak.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3875-1:** Aha! Caution is wise, and appreciated, friend Ruby. I say in balance: Those entities will forget for awhile that they have seen me. I choose this, so that trade may go forth without delay. It is sufficient.
&gt; 
&gt; **Farmer:** Thank you again, HitchWebCrouch. That puts my mind at ease. Oops, pardon me. Almost dropped you, there.
&gt; 
&gt; //Pretending to stumble while descending the stairwell, Agent Farmer activated a second alarm, indicating the presence of a potential cognitohazard.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3875-1:** Caution is wise! Please, inform if providing transport becomes troublesome.
&gt; 
&gt; **Farmer:** No trouble at all, my friend. That first step&#39;s a doozy!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3875-1:** I empathize! When I first came to this world, the sight of the sky was a startlement. To be within walls and among shelves is most pleasant.
&gt; 
&gt; **Farmer:** I hear you. Sometimes I miss my old job, too; things can get pretty hectic out in the field. Now, if it turns out I can afford it, I&#39;d love to learn how to get to the Library. That&#39;s not a kind of traveling you can learn much about around here.
&gt; 
&gt; //Further strands of web are extruded and manipulated as the agent proceeds across the grassy knoll in front of the student housing.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3875-1:** You wish to learn of Ways? I advertise: the Fuller syllabus. Some key texts have been translated, in part due to their inclusion. This researcher amassed a [http://www.scp-wiki.net/there-are-no-strings-on-me diversity of skills], with a focus on Way creation! Guidance to a nearby Way to the Library is included with purchase.
&gt; 
&gt; **Farmer:** Is there anything like a... map, I could use, of all the different Ways to the Library?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-3875-1 crouches defensively. The agent&#39;s walking pace increases slightly as the parking lot comes into view.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3875-1:** Such a map is not provided. I say free: Anyone who offers one sells //bad data//. 
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Farmer&#39;s report indicates that the phrase &#34;bad data&#34; carried a sense of extreme profanity.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Farmer:** I appreciate your advice. I wouldn&#39;t want to get taken advantage of by some [http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-beast-beneath-the-library other, less reputable spider].
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3875-1:** Aha! Put your mind at ease, my friend. I advertise: the children of TentedBeams trade value for value. My siblings throughout the worlds are above reproach.
&gt; 
&gt; //Reaching the van, Agent Farmer pulls open the door with her free hand and climbs inside. Standard surveillance equipment is visible, marked with the Foundation&#39;s logo.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3875-1:** This is the equipment you wish appraised, friend Ruby? I estimate: its value will be high. The Jailers are formidable, and do not release anything willingly.
&gt; 
&gt; //The agent codes open a storage locker containing a portable Scranton Reality Anchor and activates it.// 
&gt; 
&gt; **Farmer:** That&#39;s right. We don&#39;t.
&gt; 
&gt; //The van&#39;s rear door can be heard slamming shut from the outside.//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3875-1:** //BAD DATA//.
&gt; 
&gt; [END LOG]
