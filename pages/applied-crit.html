You open the door to the dark, cold room. Dust fills your sight as you gaze at the small blinking terminal in front of you. It feels like eternity since this room was last used. Not surprising since [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6399 | this particular AI]]] neutralised itself almost two years ago. It&#39;s not an understatement to call it one of the strongest analytic systems ever designed, able to see links and understand the effects of any anomaly we put through the system. But then it began to spew out file after file of things we hadn&#39;t even met yet. We thought it was broken, or lying to us, or just dumb. But not long after it shut down everyone found out what it was actually doing. As each anomaly it predicted came through one by one you began to try and figure out its true nature. Was it truly that far ahead of us? How far did its web of knowledge spread? But most importantly: could they bring it back? 

Your team thought about it again and again and it was hard to deny the value that such an AI could provide. It could figure out connections that you&#39;d never put together in a thousand years. Especially with this new task they want to use it for. Higher ups realised they could use the processing power of this miracle to essentially find out whatever they wanted to about certain files. The only problem was turning the thing on. Not because it was neutralised -- you managed to fix it and even add some upgrades a few days after it shut itself off -- but because working with it felt like ripping teeth out of your cat&#39;s mouth to shove into your eyes. You take a deep breath, coffee in hand, as you flip the switch. The screen lights up the room.

You look at the blank screen in disbelief. Was this for real? It almost felt worse than before. But at the very least it seems like you learnt something new about 6345. Even if you can&#39;t confirm the full truth, 6399 has proven time and time again how reliable it can be. As much as you wish you didn&#39;t have to, you booted up the screen and entered another file. You pour another coffee as you wonder how far you are willing to go for this organisation.

Blinking, you look at the blue text in front of you. That wasn&#39;t supposed to happen. It might not be the best, but you charge on ahead anyway.

[[/div]]

You shut the computer off once more, this time giving it a complete reset. You open the blank screen to see it as good as new. Which was to say still crap but by design. Looking at the mountain of files that were sent your way though, you can&#39;t help but grimace. One by one you put in each description and prepare yourself for what&#39;s ahead of you. You look at the wave of half-baked test logs, overpowered loners and random Groups of Interest with little to no explanation behind their inclusions. With each file you feel your eyes droop further and further. You can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s the exhaustion or the AI but you feel like throwing in the towel right here and now. You down your fifth coffee of the night as you realise that you&#39;ve finally made it to the last file. You breathe a sigh of relief as you quickly enter it in to get this all over and done with.
