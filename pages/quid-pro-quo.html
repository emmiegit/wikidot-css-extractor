Eugene scratched his neck nervously. He&#39;d never gotten the hang of interrogations. &#34;Look we&#39;re going to uh deport you. That&#39;s uh not even a question at uh this point.&#34; Fifty-six years old and he still couldn&#39;t talk to women. Thirty-three of those years at the Bureau and he still couldn&#39;t talk to suspects. &#34;The uh question is where we uh deport you to.&#34; Passports from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova and Kazakhstan. Different name on each -- different //face// on each, too, but that&#39;s why he was here instead of at his nice cozy basement desk at the field office. 

The woman sitting opposite him shrugged. &#34;It does not matter to me. Take your pick, Agent Vega.&#34; She was taller than him. He wished he hadn&#39;t sat down. &#34;I will be fine anywhere.&#34;

&#34;Uh right but we can&#39;t uh send you anywhere, there are --&#34; There was a knock at the door. Eugene stood a little too quickly, and all the blood rushed from his head. He steadied himself on his chair. &#34;Ok uh I&#39;ll be back in a minute, you should uh think about telling me the uh the truth. Can I uh get you some water or uh coffee or something?&#34; 

&#34;No thank you, Agent Vega. I&#39;ll be fine.&#34;

------

Detective Novak was waiting for Eugene outside the interrogation room. &#34;Hey, Vega. Ran your girl&#39;s prints through AFIS. No matches.&#34; 

&#34;Not my girl, Novak.&#34; 

&#34;Hey, so... You think she&#39;s really... You know...&#34; Novak gestured vaguely around his face. 

&#34;Really what, Novak, I don&#39;t uh like charades.&#34;

&#34;A shapeshifter, man!&#34; He lightly punched Eugene in the arm. Presumably it was supposed to be friendly. Eugene didn&#39;t appreciate it. &#34;That&#39;s why we called you in here! The spooky shit, you know?&#34;

&#34;There&#39;s no such thing as uh a shapeshifter.&#34; Technically correct. The Unusual Incidents Unit preferred more precise language. She was a multimorphic mimic. Or maybe a frighteningly good plastic surgeon. &#34;And even uh if she was you know I couldn&#39;t confirm or deny uh anything whatsoever.&#34;

&#34;Sure thing, sure thing.&#34; Novak gave him an exaggerated wink. &#34;Say no more, Vega.&#34;

Eugene sighed, and headed back into the interrogation room. 

------

&#34;Welcome back, Agent Vega.&#34; She was playing with his pen. Rookie mistake, leaving it on the table. &#34;I think we might be able to help each other after all. I&#39;ve figured you out.&#34; 

&#34;What uh do you think you&#39;ve figured uh figured out?&#34; He sat down, and she slid the pen across the table. It bounced off his stomach and rolled across the floor. &#34;Is uh this some sort of uh of mind game? Because uh I&#39;ve seen them all. Or uh heard them. I guess.&#34;

&#34;You,&#34; she said, pointing right at the fresh ink stain on his shirt, &#34;are dying. And you did it to yourself.&#34;

Eugene tried not to react, he really did. Judging by the look on her face he had not been successful. &#34;What do you uh mean?&#34;

&#34;Itchy skin. Slight yellow tint to the sclera and the fingernails. I would guess that under those cheap trousers your ankles are swelling, no?&#34; Eugene barely resisted the urge to scratch his legs. &#34;Cirrhosis of the liver. Maybe, two years to live? Ten if you stop drinking?&#34; Three and fifteen was what his doctor had told him. Maybe he was sugarcoating it. &#34;I can fix you, Agent Vega. But I will need... What is the line?&#34; She smiled. &#34;Quid pro quo. Yes or no, Eugene?&#34;

------

&#34;Alright Novak, I&#39;m uh taking her out of your hair.&#34; Eugene was, in an objective sense, a terrible liar. He sweated, he stammered, he wouldn&#39;t meet people&#39;s eyes. But he did all that when he was telling the truth, too, so it all balanced out. &#34;She&#39;s uh turning state&#39;s evidence on the uh the Odessa mob.&#34;

Novak sighed. &#34;Vega, you and I both know the Odessa Mob haven&#39;t operated out of Chicago since the 90s. If you need her for spooky shit you can just tell me.&#34; 

Now, choosing the right lies, that was a skill he&#39;d never mastered. Eugene grinned sheepishly, and nodded. &#34;I uh need her for spooky shit.&#34; He took out his official UIU ID card, and flipped it over to the back; then he flipped it over again, to the third side. &#34;And uh sorry about this Frank you know I hate to uh do this but if you could uh just look here?&#34; 

&#34;What, are you going to neuralize me or some-&#34; Sergeant Novak stared at the amnestic meme on Eugene&#39;s ID card for a few seconds, then blinked and shook his head. &#34;-thing. Sorry, what did you say? I spaced out for a sec.&#34;

&#34;I uh said I&#39;m going to uh make a Starbucks run if you uh want anything.&#34; 

&#34;Oh. No thanks. Too expensive.&#34; Novak frowned. &#34;Hey, did you...&#34; He patted his pockets. &#34;Huh. Never mind. Great to see you, Gene, but I got paperwork to do. See you around.&#34; 

------

Gene turned out of the precinct lot onto Belmont, headed for... Well, he wasn&#39;t really sure where he was headed for. &#34;Alright so uh...&#34; He paused. &#34;What uh what should I call you by the way? I know Irina isn&#39;t uh your real name but uh does that work?&#34;

&#34;Hmmm.&#34; She was staring out the passenger window, lost in thought. &#34;Call me Olivia. And take a left on Kedzie.&#34;

&#34;Ok. Olivia. So uh what do you need to fix my uh my liver?&#34; 

&#34;You missed Kedzie. Take a left at the light up ahead.&#34; She lit a cigarette and glared at Eugene before he could object. He rolled down the windows without comment. &#34;I need a sharp knife and some gauze. You&#39;re, what...&#34; She sniffed the air a few times. &#34;B negative? I have some B negative at home if you need it. Left on North.&#34;

&#34;What? We uh searched your apartment. There wasn&#39;t any uh blood there.&#34;

Olivia snorted. &#34;That, Agent Vega, was not my home.&#34; They sat in silence for a few minutes. &#34;Right on Damen.&#34;

&#34;Wait don&#39;t you uh need a uh a liver?&#34;

&#34;No.&#34;  

&#34;But...&#34;

&#34;We&#39;re here.&#34; 

------

&#34;Here&#34; was a third-floor walkup above a dry cleaner&#39;s. Pretty standard two-bedroom, except for the operating table in the middle of the kitchen. Eugene made sure it didn&#39;t make any sudden moves while Olivia dug around in the back of the refrigerator. After a few moments, she emerged with a lump of wet meat. It was pulsing faintly.

&#34;What uh what is that?&#34; 

&#34;A [[[SCP-4775|gallbladder]]]. Take off your shirt and lie down.&#34;

He followed Olivia&#39;s instructions. Not really anything else he could do, at this point. She was doing something behind him, now, but he couldn&#39;t feel anything; there was a wet slap, a few muffled curses, and then nothing but silence. 

&#34;You can sit up now. Don&#39;t drink or take tylenol for at least eight hours. You didn&#39;t lose enough blood to need a transfusion, but you&#39;ll be a little light-headed. Have a big dinner.&#34;

Eugene sat up. His back itched. &#34;That uh that was uh it?&#34;

&#34;Yes.&#34; Olivia&#39;s hands were bloody to the wrist, and her left held a sickly lump of flesh.

&#34;And that&#39;s uh that&#39;s my liver?&#34;

&#34;It is.&#34;

&#34;What uh. What are you going to uh to do with it?&#34;

&#34;Hmm. Well, I have a nice Chianti in the cabinet, maybe go get some fava beans...&#34; She rolled her eyes at his horrified expression. &#34;I am going to throw it out, Agent Vega. It&#39;s medical waste.&#34;

&#34;Oh. Uh. So that&#39;s uh it?&#34;

&#34;Yes. Well. If you don&#39;t keep the police away from me I will be taking my gallbladder back. But that&#39;s it for now at least. Goodbye.&#34; 

&#34;Uh goodbye.&#34; Eugene put his shirt back on and left without a backward glance; tomorrow, he promised himself, he would submit his retirement paperwork. Get out a year early before any more of this bullshit.</textarea></pre>
