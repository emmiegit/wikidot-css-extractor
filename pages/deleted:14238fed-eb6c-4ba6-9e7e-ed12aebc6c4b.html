Item Number- 6953

Object Class- Keter

Special Containment Procedures- SCP 6953 samples are to be kept in a glass container that is located at *Redacted* and mustn&#39;t be disturbed in anyway, shape, and form. SCP 6953-1, SCP 6953-4, SCP 6953-6, and SCP 6953-7 are to be placed in the custom cells located at *Redacted* No contact is permitted without O-5 approval. If a member of staff is to come into contact with SCP 6953, terminate immediately and throw the body into the basin. SCP 6953-1 must be placed in a warm environment and must not come into contact with any Nitrogen, so the cell&#39;s atmosphere must remain purely Hydrogen or Oxygen. SCP 6953-4 is to not to be approached without breathing protection, and must remain with its chosen toy. If ever removed from the toy, full site lockdown is initiated and all in the test chamber shall be used as sacrifice to protect those not marked for death. SCP 6953-6 must be supplied a D-Class personel that has both arms daily. They are then to be sedated and returned to their cell for one week before resuming regular activities. SCP 6953-7 vanishes for 8 hours through a portal. During the 8 hours, the cell must be repaired for until the next 8 hours arrive. During the 8 hours, SCP 6953-7 shall vanish into a portal, which appears to be similar to SCP 106&#39;s. When it returns, stun it with electromagnetic pulses until incapacitation. Return it to the cell and monitor movements until the next 8 hours of portal hopping arrive.

Descriptions- SCP 6953 is a gooey substance of an unknown color that has the ability to change and absorb carbon-based lifeforms&#39; DNA and Cells. Any and all contact results in either minor mutations or complete absorption into SCP 6953. Creatures/Entities mutated by SCP 6953 that experience only mutation and not assimilation are designated as SCP 6953-#. Currently, 7 mutations are known to be possible, however, certain anomalies have died off due to an unknown force (Another Possible SCP?). Currently, 4 subjects are alive and in captivity.
SCP 6953-1 was once an Anteater that has been infected by SCP 6953. It excretes Nitrogen the freezes on contact with air, and infects those frozen with SCP 6953. It gathers Nitrogen through the air, so pure Oxygen or Hydrogen must be in its cell to prevent it from freezing its way out. Besides those anomalous properties, it has the normal diet and needs of an Anteater.
SCP 6953-4 was once a small primate that has been infected by SCP 6953. It was in possession of a group of toys it choses to play with randomly. If it can not find a toy, a replacement must be supplied within 15 minutes. If a toy could not be supplied, all who see it begin its rage are marked for death, and the primate moves at such a speed it *Redacted* Dr. Bright&#39;s *Redacted* and began to *Redacted*, leading to &#34;The site&#39;s total collapse and a massive breach&#34; (Dr. Bright&#39;s own words) of a singular monkey who began playing with Dr. Z&#39;s Femur. It also appears to give off a smell similar to carbon monoxide in its harmfulness to humans. Besides the anomalous qualities, it is just a regular baby monkey.
SCP 6953-6 was once a human man named *Redacted* *Redacted* that has been infected by SCP 6953. It has many, many, many arms everywhere on its body, and has been given the nickname The Arm Farmer. SCP 6953-6 has the strength of an enraged SCP 96, and it uses its strength primarily to rip off the arms of unfortunate D-Classes assigned to supply the creature with more arms. If not given a D-Class a day, SCP 6953-6 will hunt for a victim and proceed to rip their arms of and *Redacted*. It then secreets a liquid similar to a lotion (Designated SCP 6953-6-A) that is rubbed onto the opened wounds of where the arms of the victim once where. After 1 week, the arms of the victim have regrown without imperfection to the state they were before the rip. SCP 6953-6 does not require sustenance, or sleep. SCP 6953-6 is unable to speak, or simply does not comprehend human speech in anyway, shape, and form.
SCP 6953-7 was an unknown entity before becoming infected with SCP 6953. SCP 6953-7 has a great amount of mutations on itself, making it impossible for any kind of identification of what it once was. SCP 6953-7 is 50 feet tall, semi-humaniod creature with vast quantities of metal wedged and jammed into its body, which appears to make up its &#34;skeleton&#34;. SCP 6953-7 appears to have the ability to create portals it travels through and vanishes from every 24 hours, and vanishes for 8 hours. SCP 6953-7 has an extreme weakness to electromagnetic pulses emitted from advanced Foundation Gear. SCP 6953-7 is extremely violent, and must be monitored constantly. If the cell SCP 6953-7 resides in, it may be moved to another prepared for this exact situation using the electromagnetic pulses to scare or poke it into the cell. If SCP 6953-7 vanishes for more than 8 hours, inform all world governments and recapture and contain when it is located (It appears to rarely move locations so widely, when it does, it moves to anywhere it has dry land to stand on).
SCP 6953-2, SCP 6953-3, and SCP 6953-5 were found dead upon entry to the facilities they were to be contained at. Currently, it is believed that another anomalous creature is hunting and extracting all samples of SCP 6953 from the remains of these anomalies. All other anomalies of SCP 6953 are to be under extreme surveillance until the hunter anomaly is contained. If any knowledge is uncovered about anyone or anything hunting these anomalies, report it to O-5 Council immediately. All known knowledge from eye witnesses are about blades of purple, but this is most likely from shock due to witnessing such atrocities done to the corpses of SCP 6953 anomalies. Until Containment, be on the lookout for shady figures.</textarea></pre>
