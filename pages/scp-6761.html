+ Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-6761-1 is to be contained in a standard containment cell. This cell is to contain at least 20 unique items or books. SCP-6761 is to be utilized at least once per day.

Use of SCP-6761 is restricted to personnel with Level 2 security clearance or above with authorization from Senior Researcher Dr. Samantha Colt.

+ Description:
SCP-6761 is a program running on a Apple Power Macintosh G3 Mini Tower, henceforth referred to as SCP-6761-1. SCP-6761, when opened, reveals a window containing 2 fields. The first field, known as the Criterion, is situated on the top of the window. The second field, known as the List, is much larger than the Criterion and is located directly underneath. Any list typed into the List category will be sorted by the Criterion with perfect accuracy. Sorting time varies, but never takes any longer than 10 seconds.  This is considered the primary effect of SCP-6761.

When SCP-6761-1 is left alone with a set of objects for an extended period of time, SCP-6761 may &#39;sort&#39; them, placing them together in a random section of the room, sorted neatly via some random criteria. This is considered the secondary effect of SCP-6761.

++ Addendum 6761.1: Test Log 1
For this test, lists and criteria were inputted into SCP-6761&#39;s interface.

Name: Dr. Samantha Colt
Criterion: Population
List: Every US State
Result: A list of every US state, perfectly sorted by population.

Name: Dr. Erica Stone
Criterion: Word count
List: A set of books from the Site 19 Library
Result: A sorted list of books. Analysis confirms that they were sorted by word count.

Name: Dr. Eric Baumann
Criterion: Time at Site 19
List: A list of various employees at Site 19
Result: A sorted list. Analysis confirms that it was sorted by the criterion indicated.

Name: Dr. Samantha Colt
Criterion: Number of molecules
List: A set of labeled glasses of water.
Result: A sorted list. Analysis indicates that it sorted by the number of molecules of the glass itself, not the water.
//Interesting. - S. Colt//

Name: Dr. Eric Baumann
Criterion: Number of sexual partners
List: A list of various employees at Site 19
Result: A sorted list.
//This is ridiculous. We are researching SCP-6761, not using it to be funny. Dr. Baumann has been reassigned, feel free to learn from his example. - S. Colt//

++ Addendum 6761.2: Recovery
SCP-6761-1 was discovered on an online civilian marketplace by MTF Mu-4. It was subsequently and covertly purchased and sent to Site 19.

&gt; Senior Researcher Dr. Samantha Colt
&gt; -----
&gt; I received a new object this morning. This object is a computer, one that can sort... seemingly any list. Given my background in computer science and my time with RAISA, this is exciting to say the least. While the object hasn&#39;t been thoroughly tested yet, I believe it demonstrates a limited form of omniscience, a form someone like myself can easily extract answers from. Using a binary search algorithm, virtually anything can be located in physical space with just a few sorts. That&#39;s just one of the many things this object could be capable of. Each sort takes about half a second, no matter the contents, so if we operate it with enough efficiency, well, it&#39;s ridiculous what we can get out of it. I&#39;ll be conducting further research on this object in the near future, just to see what it can or can&#39;t do.

++ Addendum 6761.3: Test Log 2
For this test, Dr. Erica Stone attempted to remove SCP-6761 from SCP-6761-1, using a datastick.

Test 1:
Dr. Stone plugged a standard USB flash drive into a USB port on SCP-6761-1 and attempted to place SCP-6761 into said flash drive. While SCP-6761 was identified in the hard drive, attempting to place it into the storage device yielded an error message &#39;Unknown Datatype&#39;.

Test 2:
Dr. Stone repeated the previous test, but this time using [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2306 SCP-2306] instead of a standard flash drive. The result did not change.

++ Addendum 6761.4: Incident Report 6761.I1

&gt; Incident Report 6761.I1 - Senior Researcher Dr. Samantha Colt
&gt; -----
&gt; This morning, clerks in the Site-19 Office noticed that the contents of their desks had been rearranged. I believe the cause was SCP-6761-1, located nearby. Each book was sorted by word count, computers were rearranged based upon remaining storage space, and nobody was seen tampering with the equipment affected. This has... implications to say the least. SCP-6761 may be more powerful than I initially thought. For the sake of research and containment, I request a standard containment cell with which to contain SCP-6761-1. Further testing will follow.

++ Addendum 6761.5: Test Log 3
For this test, items were left alone with SCP-6761-1 for 5 hours.

Name: Dr. Erica Stone
Items: 20 books from the Site-19 Library placed neatly on the desk in no particular order
Result: 20 books, lined up front cover facing the ceiling. Analysis indicates they were sorted by author&#39;s last name.

Name: Dr. Samantha Colt
Items: 10 colored wooden blocks scattered throughout the room
Result: 10 colored wooden blocks lined up neatly in a corner of the room. Analysis indicates they were sorted by mass.

Name: Dr. Samantha Colt
Items: None
Result: Cubic meters of cement seemingly cut from the floor were found stacked neatly in one corner. Analysis indicates that they were sorted by [DATA EXPUNGED].
//We aren&#39;t leaving it alone again. I&#39;ll write that into the containment procedures later. - S. Colt//

++ Addendum 6761.6: Interesting Development

As of April 19th, 2020, SCP-6761 has begun to show reduced performance when operated by any individual who is not Senior Researcher Dr. Samantha Colt. This, combined with SCP-6761&#39;s mysterious appearance, indicates a connection between SCP-6761 and Dr. Colt. Further research is advised.

+ Special Containment Procedures:
In order to mitigate transmission of SCP-6761, Senior Researcher Dr. Samantha Colt is not to utilize SCP-6761. SCP-6761-1 is to be stored in a standard containment cell populated with at least 20 unique objects. Individuals are not to utilize SCP-6761 unless they have level 2 clearance and have permission from Dr. Erica Stone.

+ Description:
SCP-6761 is a memetic entity that can occupy organic brains and computers. It provides its host, henceforth referred to as SCP-6761-1, with the ability to innately and easily know what order things are supposed to go in, along with the ability to anomalously sort things around it without the use of physical equipment.

SCP-6761 also alters SCP-6761-1&#39;s perception. In computers, this is noticeable by SCP-6761-1&#39;s inability to connect to the internet or run programs aside from SCP-6761. In humans, its effects are as of yet unknown.

SCP-6761 is capable of moving between hosts, a process known as &#39;transmission&#39;. When transmission occurs, the original host loses traits associated with SCP-6761 and the new host gains said traits.

++ Addendum 6761.7: Log of Transmission 1

Dr. Colt has reported slight difficulty remembering past events, along with slight agitation regarding &#39;disorderly things&#39;. No other changes have been identified.

&gt; Dr. Samantha Colt | Log of Transmission
&gt; ------
&gt; SCP-6761 is moving into my head. There&#39;s no other explanation for what&#39;s happening here. This... movement... transmission I&#39;ll call it... I&#39;m trying to mitigate it&#39;s effects for now. Hopefully I can stop it.
&gt;
&gt; It was the memory loss that ticked me off. My memory has felt... out of order recently. Almost as if SCP-6761 sorted it somehow. I checked in with medical staff yesterday, submitted myself to a psychological exam. My brain has been subject to anomalous behavior.
&gt;
&gt; That&#39;s not all. I&#39;m feeling a deep sense of discomfort and agitation whenever I see things that seem disorderly. If I can&#39;t make out a pattern to the arrangement of things, it bugs me.
&gt;
&gt; I can&#39;t see any other explanation to what&#39;s going on here. From this point forward, I&#39;ll be limiting my access to SCP-6761-1. It&#39;s all I can do, really.

++ Addendum 6761.8: Test Log 4

For this test, a Class-D individual was given a psychological exam then was instructed to interact with SCP-6761-1 frequently over the course of a week. Once the week concluded, a second psychological exam was given.

&gt; **Interviewed:** D-████
&gt;
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Erica Stone
&gt;
&gt; **Foreword:** A psychological evaluation concerning the effects of prolonged exposure to SCP-6761.
&gt;
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Stone:** So to begin our exam, tell me everything you remember.
&gt;
&gt; **D-████:** Not much. Those drugs of yours did short work of that. I remember waking up on a hospital bed and being assigned to your little project or whatever this thing is, does that count?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Stone:** Elaborate on the project.
&gt;
&gt; **D-████:** Why should I? You already know about the damn thing, aren&#39;t you a scientist or something?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Stone:** I am assessing your memory. Tell me what you know.
&gt;
&gt; **D-████:** Okay, fine. It was a few days of me fiddling about with some computer. Old fucking thing, sorted shit. Slow as fuck, but it&#39;s gotta be twenty years old at this point. After a while it started sorting that junk you gave me too. That work?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Stone:** Memory appears to be mostly intact. Now.
&gt;
&gt; //Dr. Stone takes a sheet of paper from under the table. On it is a list of every US State, sorted using a quantum random number generator.//
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Stone:** How does this make you feel?
&gt;
&gt; **D-████:** It&#39;s... a list? I don&#39;t know how a list is meant to make me feel. Seen loads of them just this past week.
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Stone:** Thank you.
&gt;
&gt; **D-████:** Uhhh... you&#39;re welcome?
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt;
&gt; **Closing Statement:** The interviewee was then subjected to a standard psychological evaluation that showed no significant difference from the previous exam.

++ Addendum 6761.9: Interview

&gt; **Interviewed:** Senior Researcher Dr. Samantha Colt
&gt;
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Erica Stone
&gt;
&gt; **Foreword:** A repeat of one section of the psychological exam used in Test 4.
&gt;
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Stone:** So, Dr. Colt. Tell me everything you remember,
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Colt** I can&#39;t tell you everything, some of its classified. At one point or another, I was living with my parents as a child. I had... some number of siblings... I&#39;m not quite sure how many. I got involved with the foundation at some point in my life... probably my early 20s. Something about an internship led me here. I can&#39;t recall the details. At one point I was involved with RAISA.... not entirely sure how that happened... and now I&#39;m here.
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Stone:** ....Thank you. Now...
&gt;
&gt; //Dr. Stone retrieves a sheet of paper from under the table. On it is a list of every US State, arranged randomly using a quantum random number generator. The configuration however, is different from Test 4.//
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Stone:** How does this make you feel.
&gt;
&gt; //Dr. Colt looks at the paper and begins to talk, but suddenly stops. She appears to enter a dissociative state for several seconds, before suddenly making eye contact with Dr. Stone.//
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Stone:** ...Dr. Colt? Are you...
&gt;
&gt; //Dr. Stone looks at the paper and notices the list has been rearranged. Analysis confirms that the list has been sorted by pollution via motor vehicle per capita.//
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Stone:** D-Did you do this?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Colt:** I-... I think I need to go.
&gt;
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt;
&gt; **Closing Statement:** Dr. Samantha Colt immediately returned to her quarters.

++ Addendum 6761.10: Log of Transmission 2

Dr. Colt has recently demonstrated the ability to rearrange text on a sheet of paper. In addition, symptoms of memory loss have worsened.

&gt; Dr. Samantha Colt | Log of Transmission
&gt; -----
&gt; It didn&#39;t work. My distance from the object didn&#39;t work. The D-Class didn&#39;t work. Nothing worked. I can rearrange text with my mind now. It feels like my thoughts themselves are getting ordered. It&#39;s becoming harder to think. I can&#39;t work like this.
&gt;
&gt; I&#39;m probably going to give up research on SCP-6761 soon. Dr. Stone can take care of it. She&#39;s good at her job. She deserves it. I can&#39;t do this anymore.
&gt;
&gt; Sometimes, when I close my eyes, I can see... sort of... a bunch of lists in front of me. Not like, text ordered in a list... I just... feel the order of things. I know the order of things. I&#39;ve been seeing these visions more and more.
&gt;
&gt; I&#39;m scared.

++ Addendum 6761.11: Transfer of Ownership

On June 19th, 2020, Dr. Samantha Colt relinquished control of SCP-6761 and all related phenomena to Dr. Erica Stone. Monitoring of Dr. Samantha Colt continued.

++ Addendum 6761.12: Interview

&gt; **Interviewed:** Senior Researcher Dr. Samantha Colt
&gt;
&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. Erica Stone
&gt;
&gt; **Foreword:** A psychological exam evaluating the effects of SCP-6761.
&gt;
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Stone:** Dr. Colt, to begin our evaluation how are you feeling?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Colt:** ...Scared.
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Stone:** ...What precisely are you scared of?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Colt:** SCP-6761. I&#39;m... different. SCP-6761 is why.
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Stone:** What do you remember?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Colt:** I have been alive for 13,546 days. I was first place in 51 math competitions I participated in over the course of grade school. I was valedictorian in my high school. I have 3 siblings. I have 2 parents. I have 1 spouse. My locker number in 5th grade was 591. I-
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Stone:** Can you tell me the name of your spouse?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Colt:** My spouse has 3 names. First, middle, last. The middle one is equal in length to the last one. The first one is shorter.
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Stone:** What is their first name?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Colt:** Their first name has 4 letters. I do not remember what letters they are. I&#39;m scared. Why can&#39;t I remember?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Stone:** ...Moving on.
&gt;
&gt; //Dr. Stone retrieves a sheet of paper from under her desk. On it is a list of countries, sorted using a quantum random number generator.//
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Stone:** How does this list make you feel?
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Colt:** It&#39;s not sorted properly. I have sorted it properly.
&gt;
&gt; //Upon closer inspection, the list has been rearranged. Analysis confirms that it was sorted by severity of mental illness per capita.//
&gt;
&gt; **Dr. Colt:** I&#39;m scared...

+ Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-6761-2 is to be stored in a standard humanoid containment cell. This cell is to be populated with any number of objects that SCP-6761-2 requests, with permission from Dr. Erica Stone. This cell is also to contain SCP-6761-2&#39;s personal computer, with which it shall perform its duties as an employee of the SCP Foundation.

With permission from Dr. Erica Stone, individuals with Level 3 or greater clearance may visit SCP-6761-2.

+ Description:

SCP-6761 is a memetic entity that presently resides within SCP-6761-2. SCP-6761 grants its host with the ability to innately know what order objects and concepts go in. SCP-6761 also alters its host&#39;s perception of reality, typically manifesting as memory loss and difficulty of thought.

SCP-6761 allows its host to rearrange objects without physical manipulation. This effect has been observed upon numerous objects, including but not limited to text on a page, parts of a computer, and books.

SCP-6761 has demonstrated the ability to move between hosts. Presently, SCP-6761 resides within SCP-6761-2, Senior Researcher Dr. Samantha Colt. The mechanics of how and why SCP-6761 may switch hosts is at this time not understood.

**DATE: 8-22-2020**

**NOTE: This log depicts the reunion of SCP-6761-2 and Dr. Ashe Rosethorn, its spouse.**
----

[BEGIN LOG]

//Dr. Rosethorn enters the containment cell. SCP-6761-2 is standing at the far end of the room, staring into a wall.//

**SCP-6761-2:** There is a visitor in my containment cell. This visitor is the tallest living entity in my containment cell. Identify yourself, visitor.

**Dr. Rosethorn:** I&#39;m... your partner, Ashe. Don&#39;t you remember me?

**SCP-6761-2:** I have been sorted. I have been neatly organized.

**Dr. Rosethorn:** Sam... what are you saying?

**SCP-6761-2:** SCP-6761 tidied my memories. They&#39;ve been sorted neatly.

//SCP-6761-2 turns to face Dr. Rosethorn.//

**SCP-6761-2:** I can see you. I can&#39;t see other people. Why can I see you?

**Dr. Rosethorn:** Sammi...

**SCP-6761-2:** That is a designation to refer to SCP-6761-2. It is not official and never was, and was in active use by one individual.

//Dr. Rosethorn falls to the floor and cries.//

**Dr. Rosethorn:** What happened to you?!

**SCP-6761-2:** ...A lot. You... appear to be in distress.

//SCP-6761-2 approaches and embraces Dr. Rosethorn.//

**SCP-6761-2:** Organized does not mean destroyed. It&#39;s like a messy child when their mom cleans their room. The memories are arcane in their arrangement, but they remain nevertheless. I could never forget you, Ashe. I can see you.

**Dr. Rosethorn:** I... love you.

**SCP-6761-2:** I love you too.
