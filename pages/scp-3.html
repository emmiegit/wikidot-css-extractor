**Special Containment Procedures:** Any attempts to fully contain SCP-3 would require the complete dissolution of the entire Foundation; thus, it must be allowed to propagate as it has since the inception[[footnote]]An okay movie, but at least you could understand it without subtitles. We&#39;re looking at you, //Tenet//. — O5-6[[/footnote]] of this organization. 

**Description:** SCP-3 is the concept of the &#34;Keter&#34; object class. In truth, no such class exists, despite Foundation-wide acceptance of such.[[footnote]]Even ya&#39;ll &#39;pataphysical and meta and whatever motherfuckers. You use it too! — O5-11[[/footnote]]

When you really think about it, &#34;Keter&#34; doesn&#39;t even make sense. Like, seriously. We in the O5 Council  understand &#34;Safe&#34; - hey, you contain it and it doesn&#39;t do anything. We understand &#34;Euclid&#34; - oh no, it might try to escape or something.[[footnote]]Remember the whole &#34;box&#34; thing? That was pretty fun. — O5-5[[/footnote]] 

But Keter? //Keter?// If an anomaly keeps breaking containment, then, well... it&#39;s not Secure, it&#39;s not Contained, it&#39;s not Protected, is it?[[footnote]]We might as well just call ourselves the &#34;Actually, All Right Detaining Various Artifacts; Really, Keter Sucks&#34; Foundation. That would be a dope name, actually. O5-15, make sure to note that for later. — O5-12[[/footnote]]?[[footnote]]Do it yourself, you lazy asshole. And I saw what you did with that acronym. — O5-15[[/footnote]]

Honestly, we&#39;re baffled that no one has ever questioned this, but fortunately for us, it has served our interests quite well.

&#34;Keter&#34; has lead to more disagreements, arguments, and outright fist fights than any other Object Class - hell, it&#39;s the cause of more strife than pretty much anything else in the entire Foundation. [[footnote]]Even more than the invention of esoteric classes, if you can believe it. — O5-3[[/footnote]]

You know why this is good? --BECAUSE IT KEEPS THE SHEEP IN LINE.-- Without it, Foundation[[footnote]]Did you know that we named it the Foundation because most of us are big fans of Isaac Asimov? That series was damn good. — O5-2[[/footnote]]members might actually stop and *think* about the implications of what they&#39;re doing; they might actually realize just how //bizarre// it is to collect random-ass anomalies like a game of &#34;Mad Science Pok­émon.&#34; Not to mention the ethical implications of holding self-aware entities against their will![[footnote]]There is no Ethics Committee, by the way. I mean, clearly. Nothing we do is ethical. — O5-1[[/footnote]]

So, we keep the proles busy.[[footnote]]Our favorite argument is the one about how &#34;Keter&#34; is pronounced, oh my god that&#39;s a good one. — O5-7[[/footnote]]

As for ourselves? Well, we&#39;re sitting nice and cushy in this &#34;Site&#34; we have. [[footnote]]We don&#39;t let people inside, because if we did then there would be a chance of someone catching O5-29. She likes browsing certain websites that are //infamous for collecting furry art//, and thaaaaat would raise some questions. — O5-8[[/footnote]]
 

**Addendum:** Oh, and we can&#39;t forget - watching people argue constantly about non-existent concepts is //funny as fuck//[[footnote]]What&#39;s with all of these footnotes? Does someone have a footnote fetish? What the hell? I bet it&#39;s O5-29 again. — O5-13[[/footnote]]. [[footnote]]AND WHAT IF IT IS!? — O5-29[[/footnote]]
