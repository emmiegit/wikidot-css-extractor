It&#39;s time for the 2024 community survey! Every year, SCP staff puts out a survey to be able to learn about the demographics of the SCP Community. Please take a moment to fill it out if you get a chance, and the results will be posted once the survey is complete! It can be found [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfy8yNU8ev9mMrSZaD9UUqu-18PSThFAtB1x4ReNS17UvpQSw/viewform here].

+ Writing Prompts
[[/div]]

Site News is bringing you monthly writing prompts! Every month there will be user-submitted prompts to help inspire new pieces. Participation in these prompts is completely optional, and any pages based on the prompts will be featured in the next issue of Site News! If you&#39;re interested in submitting a prompt for next Site News, send a wikidot PM to [[*user ParallelPotatoes]]. One prompt submission per person, and up to five prompts will be shown in each edition of Site News.

This month&#39;s writing prompts are below!

[[size x-large]]Babylon[[/size]] //Submitted by Lostinthewoods//
Write about a story set in Babylon and how it connects to the larger anomalous world!

[[size x-large]]Abnormally Normal[[/size]] //Submitted by psychicprogrammer//
In contrast with 8kcon&#39;s fantasy theme, write about something that&#39;s so normal that it&#39;s strange to see!

If you write an entry inspired by this or a previous month&#39;s prompts, feel free to send a wikidot PM to [[*user ParallelPotatoes]] to have it featured in the next Site News! There isn&#39;t a time limit on getting prompt submissions featured, so feel free to write for a previous month&#39;s prompts as well! [[footnote]]Please note than in the event of an official contest, contest entries that were inspired by a Site News prompt will be featured the month after the contest ends.[[/footnote]]

Works are featured on the site’s front page as part of the Reviewers’ Spotlight, which acknowledges the time and effort spent by forum reviewers helping other authors develop and edit and their works for the mainsite.
