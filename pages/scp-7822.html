**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7822 is currently contained at Site-23 within a cryogenic stasis unit. This stasis unit must obscure the image of SCP-7822 to outside observers, to the point where SCP-7822 can only be seen as a shadowy outline, preventing the risk of a Pythia Event on site staff.

The only reason to remove SCP-7822 from stasis is for experimentation, analysis, and study into SCP-7822’s memetic properties. Every staff member assigned for stasis removal must wear specialized eye equipment in order to prevent the manifestation of a Pythia Event.

All SCP-7822-A instances are to be brought to Site-120 for testing and analysis purposes. Project Longbow has been established to learn more about the capabilities of SCP-7822-A instances and develop effective applications of said capabilities in thaumaturgic countermeasures, without the drawbacks of SCP-7822’s influence or that of Vector 7822-Delphi.

Should an SCP-7822-A instance breach sitewide containment, termination is allowed through incineration. Any staff member subjected to Vector 7822-Delphi must be treated with Class A amnestics at once.

**Description:** SCP-7822 is an extraterrestrial corpse, 4.8 meters in length and roughly 4,500 years old. SCP-7822 possesses bilaterally symmetrical organs, three hearts, and a beaked mouth composed of chitin[[footnote]]This description has been confirmed via video recordings and indirect viewing, neither of which trigger SCP-7822’s effects.[[/footnote]]. Carbon dating has placed SCP-7822’s date of expiration at between 1500 and 1600 years ago.

Despite its deceased state, SCP-7822 possesses significant memetic influence on human subjects, propagated through visual stimuli. Specifically, SCP-7822’s memetic influence will spread through human subjects who observe the entirety of SCP-7822 head-on, with no visual aids or obstructions in their line of sight.

Once visual exposure is made in this manner, SCP-7822 will trigger a Pythia Event in the subject. Human subjects who undergo a Pythia Event are to be referred to onwards as SCP-7822-A instances.

As a result of experiencing a Pythia Event, SCP-7822-A instances will experience the following psychological, cognitive, and thaumaturgy-based changes:
* Ten (10) seconds from exposure: SCP-7822 will appear as an adult human male wearing a white linen robe, with blonde curly hair, a Caucasian skin tone, an athletic physique, a lack of body hair, and the same physical proportions as SCP-7822. This description is consistent across all SCP-7822-A instances.

*  Thirty (30) seconds from exposure: The interpretation of SCP-7822 as the Greek deity Apollo[[footnote]]The god of archery, light, music, healing, education and knowledge, herds and flocks, and the protection of the young.[[/footnote]], and that “Apollo” had expired when humans had ceased their worship of it.

* Sixty (60) seconds from exposure: At this point, SCP-7822-A instances will mourn Apollo’s “death” and develop the drive to honor “Apollo” and his pantheon’s legacy by resurrecting worship of “Apollo” in the modern day.

* Seventy (70) seconds after exposure: The elevation of natural Elan-Vital Energy[[footnote]]A form of energy emitted by all conscious entities. Can be harnessed to perform thaumaturgy when present in high enough concentrations. Also known as EVE.[[/footnote]] levels, allowing SCP-7822-A instances to utilize thaumaturgic abilities. Specifically, SCP-7822-A instances will typically demonstrate the thaumaturgic abilities below:
 * Constructs composed of solidified light energy. Usually in the form of bows and arrows, but other documented construct forms include birds and stringed instruments. The latter constructs allow for the disorientation, temporary deafening, and unbalancing of human targets through the emission of intense sound waves.
 * A form of precognition that allows for the prediction of events within the following fifteen (15) minutes. The accuracy of these predictions varies between 76% and 90%.
 * The ability to replicate the memetic effects of SCP-7822 on command, through a vocalized transmission vector dubbed Vector 7822-Delphi. SCP-7822-A instances initially attempted to use Vector 7822-Delphi on researchers, but after approximately six (6) months began using it solely towards D-class personnel.

**Addendum: Discovery:** SCP-7822 was discovered on 2020-8-22 in central Greece, specifically within the Mount Parnassus mountain range, after the Project PANOPTICON system[[footnote]]A global surveillance program that utilized numerous pieces of paratechnology to gain intelligence crucial to the Foundation’s operations. Headquartered in Site-120.[[/footnote]] detected unusual levels of both Akiva Radiation[[footnote]]An anomalous form of radiation associated with worship and divine intervention.[[/footnote]] and EVE within the 5x5 meter area on the Liacouras peak. 

Satellite imaging confirmed the existence of a makeshift worship site, located at 2,400 meters above sea level at the mouth of a cave. Further coverage of this site revealed the existence of Group of Interest-7822, which addresses itself as Apollo’s Bowmen.

Field agent Atticus Castellanos was sent to investigate the group, due to his fluency in Greek and his operative history in the Balkan region. Agent Castellanos’s cover was as Dimitris Markos, a reporter from a local newspaper who was sent to write an article on the group.

The following interview took place after Agent Castellanos was contacted by Person of Interest-7822-B, the leader of GoI-7822.

&gt; **Interviewed:** PoI-7822-B
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Agent Atticus Castellanos
&gt; 
&gt; **Foreword:** This interview took place  on 2020-08-31, upon the deck of PoI-7822-B’s residence in the rural part of the Phocis administrative region. All dialogue been translated from Greek to English.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Castellanos:** Alright, everything’s set up. We’re good to go.
&gt; 
&gt; **Person of Interest-7822-B:** Great. I’m glad to finally talk with someone from the papers.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Castellanos:** Yeah, I’m glad I could sit down with you. People back home have sparked all kinds of rumors about what you folks do here.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-7822-B:** Well, it would be my pleasure to clear those things up. Let’s get started, hmm?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Castellanos:** Of course, of course. Now, the first thing I’d like to discuss is, what exactly do you guys do up on the mountain? I understand that it’s a religious site of sorts, but further details are rather sparse.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-7822-B:** It is true that our encampment is a worship site. What most people don’t know is exactly //what// we worship. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Castellanos:** Would you care to elaborate on that?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-7822-B:** Naturally. We&#39;ve developed a reinvention of sorts of the belief systems of the ancient Greek civilization. You see, the Bowmen are not polytheistic. We only worship the scriptures and goals of the god Apollo.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Castellanos:** Why Apollo in particular? Does that have anything to do with his history in the area?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-7822-B:** //chuckles// Yes, actually. Apollo himself has held significant influence here. His most powerful site of worship, Delphi, is just south of here by the Gulf of Corinth. It’s one of his most prized sites of worship, as through it he gained the strength he needed to bring to Greece the miracles he was so renowned for.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Castellanos:** Sounds like you folks have got quite the history to base your faith off of.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-7822-B:** Indeed we do. But alas, as history moved on so did humanity. The faiths of the Greeks and the Romans fell to the wayside, and with them so did the powers and body of Apollo. In the final moments before his body failed him, Apollo returned to the one place most sacred to him. The Lightbringer returned home.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Castellanos:** Are you saying that Apollo is dead? That he was killed by humanity no longer worshiping him?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-7822-B:** You’re very close, Mr. Markos. Hisbody no longer functions, but his mind is still there. He’s reaching out to us from within that cave, calling to us to return honor to his name, to bring his faith to the forefront once again. To restore the worship that humans once held for him. It is the least we can do for him, after all he has done for us in life.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Castellanos:** And how exactly do you plan to do that?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-7822-B:** As Apollo once was, as we are now. We provide to him our own form of strength, and in return he provides us with the strength he possessed in life. It is our honor and duty to bestow upon others the truth of the Lightbringer’s fate.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Castellanos:** That’s the second time you’ve called Apollo the Lightbringer.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-7822-B:** Yes, it’s an honorific title. All Bowmen use it, as a way to express Apollo’s divinity.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Castellanos:** Well, I’m sure that the Lightbringer would be proud of what the Bowmen are doing.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Castellanos pauses suddenly, in apparent confusion at what he just said.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Castellanos:** //*quietly, in a confused tone*// Wait, what?
&gt; 
&gt; //PoI-7822-B grins slightly at this.//
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-7822-B:** I believe that’s all the time I have, Mr. Markos. I hope to see you again.
&gt; 
&gt; **End Log**

**Addendum: Post-Interview Events:** When Agent Castellanos returned to Site-120 with his recording, he appeared to have somehow experienced mild exposure to SCP-7822’s memetic agent, after repeatedly addressing SCP-7822 as either Apollo or the Lightbringer. 

Agent Castellanos willingly entered further examinations, which revealed the existence of Vector 7822-Delphi. Castellanos was subjected to Class A amnestics in an attempt to eliminate Vector 7822-Delphi’s influence. This proved effective in purging the effects of Vector 7822-Delphi.

Afterwards, it was decided that a lack of intervention regarding the members of GoI-7822 would risk an AK-class “Memetic Dominance” scenario. MTFs Tau-5 (Samsara) and Eta-10 (See No Evil) were dispatched with two primary goals: to collect SCP-7822 and arrive at a time where numerous GoI-7822 members were present, in order to bring as many into Foundation custody. These goals were carried out effectively, with the caveat that PoI-7822-B and three of his subordinates could not be located at the time.</textarea></pre>
