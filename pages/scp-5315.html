[[include component:image-block | name=mayanPainting.jpg | caption=An original instance of SCP-5315-1]]

**Item #:** SCP-5315

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Any discovered instances of SCP-5315 or SCP-5315-1 should be carefully acquired and transported to Site-73 for permanent containment. All instances are currently being contained in Storage Room 73-19 and are to be maintained at regulated temperature and humidity as to not damage the paint. While in containment, all active and neutralized instances of SCP-5315-1 should be organized separately and labelled. Instances are to be monitored 24/7 for possible interaction from within SCP-5315-A. Should any inhabitants of SCP-5315-A pass through, they are to be contained safely for further handling with a designated researcher. Any suspected new production sources of SCP-5315 should be reported immediately for further investigation.

**Description:** SCP-5315 is the designation given to any anomalous instance of the pigment compound commonly referred to as &#34;Mayan Blue&#34;. While SCP-5315 outwardly exhibits no anomalous properties of its own, upon application to a surface, herein referred to as SCP-5315-1, any covered surface area will act as a sort of dimensional rift. Any object that passes through one of these rifts will will be transported to SCP-5315-A. The anomalous effects of SCP-5315 have a limited lifespan and will fade over time, with instances of SCP-5315-1 eventually becoming self-neutralized. While a definitive lifespan has not been determined, researchers have concluded two factors that negatively impact the lifespan of the object: the size of the painted area and usage of the object. Apart from its anomalous traits, the pigment also naturally exhibits great durability, capable of maintaining its vibrant color over long periods of time.

**[NOTE: FULL DESCRIPTION OF SCP-5315-A AND ITS INHABITANTS HAS BEEN MOVED TO CORRESPONDING LOCATION DOSSIER]** SCP-5315-A is an alternate dimension that has captured Foundation attention largely due to the presence of an advanced civilization and its apparent ties to our baseline reality. SCP-5315-A is populated by a number of biological organisms that bear striking resemblance to those depicted in traditional Mesoamerican mythology; particularly that of the Maya civilization. The most notable among these native entities is a sapient quasi-humanoid race known as the Xett, designated by the Foundation as SCP-5315-X. Coexisting alongside these native entities are another race known as the Yett, designated as SCP-5315-Y. The Yett, who outwardly appear to be human, are evidently non-native to SCP-5315-A, and are in fact descendants of the Mayan Civilization who took refuge in the dimension many centuries ago during the decline of their civilization. Genetic testing of SCP-5315-Y individuals seems to confirm this. Despite their non-native origins within the dimension, SCP-5315-Y appears to have developed a strong kinship with SCP-5315-X; with the two having grown together into a unified civilization. The civilization, collectively known as the Ruuluuth, is a highly modern society which has shown mastery over the creation and usage of anomalous tools and technologies. --It is currently unknown if the Ruuluuth still possess the ability to produce SCP-5315. While the Ruuluuth have stated that the technique has been forgotten to time, the Foundation is currently accepting this response with skepticism.--

Instances of SCP-5315 and SCP-5315-1 were utilized by the Foundation for research into SCP-5315-A up until 1977 at which point testing was suspended on account of nearly all viable test instances of SCP-5315-1 having become neutralized from either passage of time or overuse.  With the loss of both eyes and ears into SCP-5315-A, the Foundation deemed the dimension and its inhabitants a potential security hazard as there was no way to monitor them. This issue was compounded by all research, both by the Foundation and by public researchers into the makeup of &#34;Mayan Blue&#34; being inconclusive. This iron curtain did not raise until Incident-5315-1 in 1991, which allowed the Foundation&#39;s first trip back into the pocket dimension in nearly 15 years.

**Addendum:** 

[[collapsible show=&#34;Discovery &amp; History: SCP-5315&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]

SCP-5315 can be traced back several centuries to the Maya Civilization where it can be found featured prominently on a number of artifacts and architectural structures. Similar to other instances of SCP-5315-1, the anomalous effects of these instances have become neutralized over time and the instances went unnoticed for many years. In 1931, the pigment captured renewed attention among the research community due to its aforementioned high durability, with scientists noting the vibrant colors of original Mayan artifacts that had stood the tests of time astoundingly well. A number a researchers set out to solve the mystery of this longevity in the hopes of reverse-engineering it to make new pigments and paints of similar strength. These efforts were largely unsuccessful until 1949 when a small German chemical manufacturer named Schmitt-Mittburg released a new pigment referred to as &#34;MeerFrau Blau&#34; or &#34;Mermaid Blue&#34;. 

The substance produced by Schmitt-Mittburg was distributed to other manufacturers and it was the products of these companies that began exhibiting anomalous properties that would eventually go on to catch the Foundation&#39;s attention, earning them the collective designation of SCP-5315-1. While there is no record of Schmitt-Mittburg linking the substance to &#34;Mayan Blue&#34;, the company did apparently market the substance&#39;s durability and the Foundation would go on to determine that the substance was chemically similar to that found on original Mayan artifacts. The production of SCP-5315 by Schmitt-Mittburg was short lived, only lasting around two months; this being a result of the company being shuttered by the &#34;Level of Industry&#34;[[footnote]]The Allied Forces&#39; policies aimed at de-industrializing West Germany[[/footnote]] plans enacted on West Germany (where the company was located) following WWII.

It is largely unknown how the company came to know how to produce the substance or if they were aware of the anomalous properties it possessed. The reigning theory on this, though unsubstantiated, is that the company came into possession of documentation detailing the formula behind the pigment&#39;s creation. While the origin of such a document is unknown, due to the popularity of occultism amongst some Nazi sects it is believed there may have been possible research into the substance by the group. There is no solid evidence of this though as it appears that the majority of documentation belonging to the company was either destroyed or confiscated following its closure. Nearly all instances of SCP-5315-1 contained by the Foundation can be traced back to instances of SCP-5315 produced by Schmitt-Mittburg (this excluding any original Mayan artifacts or any instances following Incident-5315-1 described later).

To date, the Foundation has contained 481 instances of SCP-5315-1; though nearly 85% of these instances were produced by only two manufactures, Überlegen and Grüne Welt, who manufactured dinnerware and gardenware respectively, Nearly all instances produced by the two manufacturers are too small to be used for transversal into SCP-5315-A.

[[tab Overview]]
&gt; **NOTE: THE FOLLOWING DOSSIER SERVES AS A HIGH-LEVEL GUIDE TO SCP-5315-A AND IS COMPOSED OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH CARRIED OUT BY THE FOUNDATION AS WELL AS INFORMATION GATHERED FROM THE LIMITED CONVERSATIONS WITH ITS INHABITANTS. DUE TO THE LANGUAGE BARRIER, COMMUNICATION OF HIGHER LEVEL TOPICS HAS BEEN LIMITED. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT ALL PROPER NAMES STATED HEREIN ARE PHONETIC INTERPRETATIONS OF THEIR LANGUAGE TRANSLATED INTO A READABLE ALPHABET.**
 
SCP-5315-A is a sprawling pocket dimension that is home to the Ruuluuth civilization. The landscape of the dimension seems to consist entirely of one large &#34;mountain range&#34; comprised of various rock formations of various shapes and sizes, many with seemingly impossible natural formations such as &#34;pipe-like&#34; structures that loop and curve. Scattered among these other formations are a number of large plateau-like surfaces with near perfect levelness. Many of these plateaus house anomalous self-contained biomes that do not extend past the edge of the the rock structure; these biomes can include features such as wetlands with non-stop torrential downpour, snowy forests, or prairie grasslands. Outside of these biomes, the dimension&#39;s landscape is entirely arid, with no rainfall or visible bodies of water. It has been found that despite the outwardly dry appearance, many of the plateaus contain large aquiferous bodies of water. Furthermore, it has been found that this water is capable of flowing between the rock formations via hollow channels within the &#34;pipe-like&#34; structures; creating a complex and interconnected network of waterways. The Ruuluuth people have learned to harness the anomalous properties of this land to their advantage; They have settled their cities atop the plateaus and strategically zoned their usage based on the surrounding biome. They have also mastered usage of the series of natural &#34;pipes&#34; as a effective method of water distribution among their cities and farmland.

To date, all access to Ruuluuth has been through SCP-5315-A-0, more commonly referred to as The Swamp. The Swamp, like the biomes mentioned above, sits atop a plateau just East of the Ruuluuth&#39;s second largest city, Izuuk. The Swamp spans several acres and largely consists of a number of disconnected pools of water. It is within these pools that rifts will form when an instance of SCP-5315-1 is created. Every instance of SCP-5315-1 in baseline reality has a counterpart rift within SCP-5315-A. Entrance into one rift will always exit out of the corresponding other end and vice versa. If neutralized, both ends will close simultaneously. It is still unknown why all exit rifts are formed within the confines of the Swamp regardless of the location of its counterpart in our world. Similarly, it is theorized that an instance painted within SCP-5315-A, would always exit out around the Sacred Cenote area of Mesoamerica.

[[tab Inhabitants]]

Foundation has classified entities existing within SCP-5315-A into three primary categories:

**SCP-5315-X**, otherwise known as the Xett, are the indigenous inhabitants of SCP-5315-A. They have a generally humanoid appearance with a few key distinctions. The Xett exhibit a tough outer hide that is significantly tougher than that of normal human skin and is typically grey in color; they possess no hair on their bodies. While their heads maintain the general form of that of a human being, their skulls are significantly larger and the entities&#39; feature have no lips leaving their teeth showing at all times. One of the more jarring physical attributes of the Xett is the high variance in their height, ranging anywhere from 1.25 to 3 meters. The Xett possess a lifespan roughly twice that of a typical human. The Xett seem to have a natural inclination for creating and harnessing what the Foundation would consider to be anomalous tools. It is hoped that in the future the language barrier may be broken so that this knowledge may be obtained.

**SCP-5315-Y** otherwise known as the Yett, are the living descendants of the Mayan people that took refuge within SCP-5315-A following the decline of their civilization. Despite their branching away from the rest of humanity, they are virtually indistinguishable from a modern day descendant in our reality. Testing of Yett DNA has found that they are genetically similar to the modern day descendants of the Mayan people in our reality. More specifically, it is believed that the majority of the original settlers were of Itzá ethnicity (though the exact composition of the group has been undetermined). While the Yett are nearly indistinguishable from their counterparts in our reality, it has been noted that the Yett have developed an almost innate adaption toward their mountainous surroundings. Foundation researchers have observed children as young as 5 years of age capable of scaling the sheer cliffs of the dimension with relative ease.

[[include component:image-block | name=camazotz.jpg | caption=Ancient Maya depiction of the Camazotz]]

**SCP-5315-Z** is the designation given to all other fauna present within the dimension; this includes both native and non-native entities. As with SCP-5315-X, there are a number of biological organisms in this category that bear resemblance to mythological creatures depicted and described in Mesoamerican art and literature. Among these are entities matching the descriptions of creatures such as the Ahuizotl[[footnote]]Aquatic, canine entity possessing a tail ending in a hand[[/footnote]], Camazotz[[footnote]]Tall, chiropteran entities[[/footnote]], and Q&#39;uq&#39;umatz[[footnote]]Large, feathered serpent[[/footnote]] (more commonly known by the Aztec name of Quetzalcoatl). Many of these entities consistently feature colorful calcified protrusions that at first were mistaken for precious metals or gemstones; the exact evolutionary reason for these protrusions are unknown. Apart from the native entities of the dimension, there are also a number of them that bear their origins from our reality. A number of insects, birds, reptiles and small mammals are among those that have been found within the dimension; seemingly after either being brought over intentionally or having evidently wandered into an open rift. The most prevalent of these non-indigenous species are rabbits, which have bred rampantly within SCP-5315-A and have become a primary source of food for its inhabitants.

[[tab History]]

[[include component:image-block | name=Cenote.JPG | caption=The Sacred Cenote Chichén Itzá]]

Due to language barriers, the known history of the civilization is largely high-level, with much of it having been communicated pictorially. From what the Foundation has pieced together, the Xett first made contact with the Maya Civilization during testing of a new anomalous technology they had developed, which we have come to refer to as SCP-5315. It is believed that the first contact between the Xett and Mayan people was near the city of Chichén Itzá, where the Xett first arrived through a rift formed within a pool at the site of the Sacred Cenote. Despite the apparent differences between the two groups and the presence of a clear language barrier, the two peoples became greatly enamoured with each other. The two began exchanging ideas and technologies, with the Xett bringing over a number of paratechnologies (including SCP-5315) and the Mayans fascinating the Xett with their advancements in astrology (as a pocket dimension, their homeworld SCP-5315-A is a self-contained bubble with no true &#34;outer space&#34;). Rumor of the other-worldly beings began to spread across the Mayan territory with many of those unable to meet the Xett for themselves beginning to hail them in a god-like fashion, depicting them as such. Free travel and trade in between the two realms was established and the two prospered together. The allegiance would continue up until sometime in the mid-1200&#39;s; it was at this time that the Mayan Civilization and many of its major cities (including Chichén Itzá) began to decline. This decline began to put a strain on the two&#39;s relationship and the once intertwined societies began to pull apart. Fearing the fall of their own empire, a group of Mayans, roughly around 2200 individuals sought refuge with the Xett within their domain; a request which was ultimately granted.

Shortly after their settlement into the dimension, a plague broke out amongst the Xett and it was evident that it had been brought over by the Mayan refugee albeit unintentionally. The plague wiped out about 30% of the Xett population and stirred great unrest and anger toward the refugees among some Xett. A civil war broke out and the Xett population ended up splintering into several factions holding varying views toward the outsiders. The remained the status quo for many years until one of the factions named the Ruuluuth, began seeking to unify the people under common order. This goal was ultimately achieved roughly a century prior to Foundation contact with the Ruuluuth and has been maintained since. While the Ruuluuth is supportive of its human inhabitants, it has been noted by the Foundation that the highest levels of the government are largely dominated by the Xett. It has also been noted that the Order has been slowly concealing knowledge of other realities among its peoples in an apparent attempt to shroud the true origins of the Yett.

    The following section is based on the research of the former Lead Researcher assigned SCP-5315-A, the late Dr. Horacio Pol. Following his passing, all original documentation by Dr. Pol has been taken into possession of the O5 Council for further review and integration into the contents of the dossier. This section contains a summary of the more theoretical findings of Dr. Pol&#39;s research that have not been made official with the rest of the dossier.

The most widely accepted of his hypotheses is Dr. Pol&#39;s &#34;Second Home&#34; Theory, which at it&#39;s core simply stated that SCP-5315-A may not be the original home dimension of the Xett people. While the evidence is largely circumstantial, Dr. Pol has provided a number of considerable arguments for his case. Pol has contended that the evolution of the Xett people to their current form seems improbable. Firstly, Dr. Pol has asserted that given the extreme environment of the dimension, it would be difficult for a natural evolution to a sapient form to occur. He has also asserted that among the numerous instances of SCP-5315-Z that have been catalogued, none with possible ancestral links to the Xett have been discovered. The primary argument against this theory is that as is the case with pocket dimensions, it is entirely possible that a natural evolution may have not occurred and that all of the entities residing within the dimension spontaneously manifested in a sort of procedurally generated manner. This would also explain the recurring occurrence of the colorful calcified protrusions prominent on the native entities. Pol admits that this would otherwise stand in opposition to his theory save for one glaring factor, the Xett are among the only entities to not feature this trait. If they manifested, it would be strange that they too did not have this trait, and if they evolved, there is no reason for why the trait would have disappeared. Pol points to all of this as sound evidence of the Xett&#39;s non-native origins and conjectures that they used the same rift creating technology to migrate from another dimension. The reason for such a migration is unknown.

The other heavily discussed theory of Pol is his &#34;1000&#34; theory. The theory focuses on a particular entity depicted in Mayan mythology, the Sisemite. The Sisemite, depicted as hairy, nocturnal humanoid-like creatures, does not match any entities discovered within SCP-5315-A. It does however bear an uncanny resemblance to the infamous [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-1000 SCP-1000]. While the popular hypothesis is that these may be depictions of instances of SCP-1000 witnessed in the wilderness by the Mayan people prior to settling within SCP-5315-A, Pol has stated that it is unusual that the depiction would appear among the depictions of entities native to SCP-5315-A. Pol asserts that the Xett and SCP-1000 may be connected, though he has stated that he is unsure of the exact correlation. His predominant theory works in conjunction with his &#34;Second Home&#34; theory, essentially stating that the Xett may have hailed from another reality coexisting with SCP-1000. It was during this time that they acquired a penchant for anomalous technology, which he has stated as being eerily similar to that belonging to SCP-1000. Dr. Pol goes on to say that the two may have migrated to SCP-5315-A together but ultimately had a falling out, possibly due to the Xett&#39;s affairs with the Mayan people. 

While both theories have not been accepted by the general Foundation community, it has been generally accepted that there is likely a certain amount of history still unknown about the Xett, or moreover, hidden from us. Much of the history prior to contact with the Maya is comparatively fuzzy to that following it. It is unknown exactly why so much of this history has been lost, but it is clear that there are some things that the the Ruuluuth government does not want the Foundation or even its own people to know.

**Exploration Video Log Transcript**

**Date:** 10/21/2006

**Subject:** SCP-5315-A

**Mission Control Team Lead:** Dr. Dixie Clark

**Response Team Lead:** Agent Goose

**Response Team Members:** Agent Garcia, Agent Krete

**Forward:** On the morning of 10/21/1991, officials at the University of Missouri filed a missing persons report for Dr. Kenneth Conrad, a chemical engineering professor whose research focused on the recreation of rare colors and pigments. After failing to arrive for a scheduled meeting with a student, investigation of building CCTV showed no signs of the professor leaving his office the night prior. Foundation agents monitoring local police channels flagged the incident and began an investigation of the professor&#39;s office. The southern wall of the room had been haphazardly painted with a blue paint, and the section of the wall was quickly identified as an instance of SCP-5315-1. With all Foundation attempts to duplicate SCP-5315 having been unsuccessful, a search-and-rescue response team was formed with the goal of recovering the professor from SCP-5315-A in the hopes that the formula for SCP-5315 could be extracted from him. While the inhabitants of SCP-5315-A have shown no prior ill will toward the Foundation or baseline reality, given their advanced nature and the many years having gone unchecked the mission to recover the means of creating SCP-5315 has been deemed critical. It is unknown how he obtained the means through which to produce the substance.
-----

[BEGIN LOG]

//Video feed attached to Agent Goose begins in the office of Dr. Conrad facing the blue painted wall. After another agent gives a thumbs up, the three agents sprint into the painted wall where they are suddenly transported into a murky underwater area. After several minutes of combing the water, the trio proceed to the surface. Upon climbing topside, the three strip out of their scuba gear and plant a marker for easy relocation of the entry pool.//

**Clark:** Alrighty boys, you know the mission. It is possible that nearly a day has elapsed since Conrad&#39;s entry and we have a lot of ground to cover so let&#39;s get moving. Since we used the same entry rift as him, we should have exited out into the same pool as him. Since there is no sign of him there we can rule it out. If it comes to it we will contend with the idea that he could have hopped into the wrong pool trying to get back and drowned, but for now lets focus on dry land. It&#39;s been a decade and some change since I last saw this place as a junior researcher on the project so your guess is as good as mine on what to expect. Stay vigilant.

**Goose:** Roger that Mam.

//After approximately 12 minutes of searching, Krete sends out a distress signal to the group. The two other agents rush to find him surrounded by about 2 dozen large Chiropteran[[footnote]]Bat-like[[/footnote]] entities.//

**Clark:** Great, pack hunters. Now I&#39;m really feeling optimistic about this mission. Last I checked they aren&#39;t an endangered species, so feel free to go ahead and dispatch them as needed. 

//A loud shriek then fills the recording audio as a massive entity resembling a feathered serpent spanning several meters descends down, scattering the pack. Saddled atop the serpent is a structure resembling a trolley car, affixed to the creature&#39;s back via a series of pistons that seem to stabilize the car in a level position as the serpent writhes its body. Several humanoid entities dressed in what appears to be tactical gear emerge from the car and surround the response team agents. After looking the agents up down for a few seconds, one of the entities etches out the letters S - C - P in the mud with his foot and looks back at the agents pensively.//

**Goose:** *Nods*

//The entity motions for the team to board the car and after receiving control room approval from Clark, the team follows them in. Several minutes pass while the crew sit silently aboard the car; looking out the window, cities and other flying serpents can be spotted amongst the mountains. The serpent eventually touches down at what appears to be a military base and the team is led off the car. The team is then escorted into the base passing several instances of SCP-5315-X and Y along the way before eventually being ordered to sit down in what looked to be an interrogation room. Waiting for them in the room were two entities, a tall finely dressed SCP-5315-X, and a solemn-faced SCP-5315-Y wearing decorated military attire.//

**SCP-5315-Y:** Hello. Welcome. I am Dr. Ruub and this is Agent Thuuthuuru. Following visits past by your kind, a number of books and writings were left behind. A select of us have spent much time learning from them and attempting to decipher your language in the hopes that you may return. Am I understood to you?

**Goose:** *Nods*

**Ruub:** Wonderful. It brings me much happiness to know that our work has been paid. Before I go on, I must confirm you are who you say. Do you have the code?

//After several seconds of flipping through pages of notes, Clark relays the code to Goose. Goose taps a series of morse code beats on the table. Agent Thuuthuru nods in acceptance back at Ruub.//

**Ruub:** More wonderful. Welcome SCP. We are happy to welcome you back after such long time. I will now turn this conversation to Agent Thuuthuuru and become translator.

//Thuuthuuru speaks in Ruuluuth language.//

**Ruub:** He says he knows you are here for job. You are searching for someone?

**Goose:** *Nods* Yes, do you know where they are?

//Ruub relays this to Thuuthuuru who responds back in Ruuluuth language.//

**Ruub:** The &#34;someone&#34; is here.

//A human male matching the description of Conrad is then escorted into the room. He stares wide-eyed at the response team.//

**Goose:** Hello Dr. Conrad, my name is Agent Goose. It appears you&#39;re a little lost. We were sent here to search and rescue you on the behalf of the SCP Foundat—

**Conrad:** I don&#39;t want to hear it. The SCP? What is that,  some sort of CIA clandestine group? Code for the Illuminati. Nope, nope, nope, I&#39;ll be damned to consider consorting with the likes of you. I&#39;m staying here.

//Goose takes a deep breath before attempting to feign a smile.//

**Goose:** Now doctor, I assure you we are only here to help you. If you would allow me to, I will gladly explain who we are. Don&#39;t you want to come home?

**Conrad:** What part of NO don&#39;t you understand? And home? There isn&#39;t anything there for me. I don&#39;t have a family of my own, between teaching and research I hardly have any time for friends or hobbies, and whatever joy I used to glean from my research as all but been snuffed out by the bureaucracy of the educational system. And for pete sake I study colors, I&#39;m not making much of a difference. And the one good thing to ever come from my research, whatever it is that I did to lead me here, I&#39;m sure is going to be all but confiscated by you or the government or whoever and I&#39;m going to be locked up in some facility to never tell the tale. So no, I don&#39;t want to go back with you. I want to make a new life, here.

**Goose:** Let&#39;s try to be sensible about—

**Conrad:** I said NO. *Turns to Ruub and Thuuthuuru* Please, won&#39;t you let me stay? I&#39;ll do whatever it takes; just don&#39;t let them take me.

//Conrad spins to face Ruub and Thuuthuuru//

**Conrad:** Please, won&#39;t you let me stay? I&#39;ll do whatever it takes; just don&#39;t let them take me.

//Discussion between Ruub and Thuuthuuru.//

**Ruub:** Now I think the nice man here is good meaning. I don&#39;t know if we—

**Conrad:** What if I tell you how I got here? How I made the portal?

//Discussion between Ruub and Thuuthuuru.//

**Ruub:** Thuuthuuru says that if you can provide such information, your refuge may be granted.

//Conrad shoots a grin at the team before approaching Ruub. He hands Ruub a torn out journal page. After eyeing the page up and down, Ruub leans over and whispers the contents to Thuuthuuru who then whispers something back. Thuuthuuru then stands up and opens his arms as if looking to embrace, a wide smile spreading across his face.//

**Ruub:** Thuuthuuru says welcome to your new home.


//Smiling, Conrad goes to enter the embrace of Agent Thuuthuuru. As he does so though, Ruub suddenly procures a syringe from within his shirt pocket it and quickly drives it into the professor&#39;s neck. The man then fell limp as the agent picks up his body and cradles it in his arms as he approaches the team. He then hands the body to Agent Krete and gives a nod to Ruub who begins to speak.//


**Ruub:** He belongs to you. We have simply put him to sleep. We know you have the potion that makes you forget, just as we do; give it to him. Just as it is not healthy for him to know of this place, it is not healthy for our people to know of him.

//Ruub is noticeably more solemn now.//

**Ruub:** You fear us; we know this. You want to protect your people, as do we. Things are different, very different since you last came. The new order, the powers that are, they fear you being here. They have no interest in your world, and they want to be sure our people have no interest in it either. You are a myth, a story. They want to keep it that way. 

//Ruub glances at Thuuthuuru, then begins to speak in a more hushed tone.//

**Ruub:** Thuuthuuru cannot understand us. Few can, and you may find it strange to know that only those of Xett have been chosen to learn your tongue. Human nature is to wonder; to look across the ocean and wonder what may lie on the other side, or to look up to the sky and wonder what it may be like to live amongst the stars. Ruuluuth has no seas, nor stars. While not spoken so freely, those who work close to the Order know what they fear most. They fear the day the Yett will begin to wonder. They fear the day the Yett will yearn of their home. You fear that we may one day come once again and seek to harm your world; but the truth is the Order has destroyed almost all knowledge on how to reach your world. Some remains, but it is tightly held. When you leave, me and Thuuthuuru will have our knowledge stripped from us. It is for the best. Just as you have your reasons for keeping us hidden, we have ours.

//Ruub walks towards Agent Goose, offering the journal page containing the formula to SCP-5315.//

**Ruub:** As a sign of trust, we give this to you. We have no need for it. We trust it in your hands, and we hope that trust is well placed. I am sure you understand the precautions we wish to take. You are welcome as guests always, and when you leave we will begin monitoring the Swamp for your arrival next. We look forward to our continued friendship.

//The team is escorted out of the room and back to the extraction point.//

[END LOG]

&gt; Following the events of the incident, viable instances of SCP-5315 have been created based on the retrieved formula. After an uncooperative interview with Conrad attempting to find where he learned the formula from, he was ultimately administered amnestics and released. In 1993, the Foundation released under alias a public research paper detailing a modified composition of &#34;Mayan Blue&#34; consisting of indigo dye and palygorskite clay that would possess the durability of the original but without the anomalous effects; this was done in the hopes of halting further research into the pigment. Suspension of testing has been ended.
