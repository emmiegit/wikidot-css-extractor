He&#39;d never really understood knives and the odd obsession some people had with them.  Just little scraps of metal, sharpened and placed in a handle, a knife wasn&#39;t all that amazing.  He admitted that, yes, for the most part they were given a somewhat overlooked position in life, but placed in the hands of someone with a violent disposition, or faced with an unhappy and carnivorous creature, they could take on near mythic qualities.  What&#39;s more, they often weren&#39;t all that useful in those situations...truly an overrated and undeserving tool.

Take, for example, this young woman.  Even in the dark of the basement, where a flashlight or even a match would be much more useful, she brandished the knife as if it could somehow make up for her blindness.  Crawling and sobbing, she held the knife out, waving it like a feeler as she pawed for the stairs.  He chuckled, watching.  Truly an overrated tool.  Even if she&#39;d seen a target, what could she do with it really?  She shrieked briefly, almost tumbling in to the hole he&#39;d bored in to the basement with.

She&#39;d even come down the stairs with the skinny little blade, the silly thing.  He&#39;d tried to be quiet, but the cat had raised a yowling that summoned the girl a bit early.  She&#39;d found the body about the same moment he&#39;d bitten out the light bulb, quickly skittering to slam the door before she&#39;d made it up, the sudden darkness tumbling her silly, ill-equipped head back down to the floor.  He watched, hooked in to the ceiling, as she flailed about helplessly.  His eyes started to glaze with anticipation, the vertical slit of a maw trembling with amusement as he slowly started to lower down, hook by hook.

He&#39;d show her the folly of such inadequate little tools such as knives.  He fell beside her, the lower eyepads recording her shock.  He&#39;d show her how much better a natural tool is.  He readied the knives he was born with.

All six of them.
