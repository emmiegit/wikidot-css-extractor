DESCRIPTION:
(Scp 7895 is typically 6’2 feet tall, getting bigger the darker it is; it resembles a featureless human; The origins are currently unknown although researchers have a theory in very early stages of development. Scp 7895 is a sentient creature while limited in its movement it has vigorous hearing and sight.
Scp 7895 operates like a normal human although it can only move throughout shadows or rematerialize in shadows in view, also its method of reproduction is vastly different the anomaly can only reproduce by releasing spores, these spores slowly transition the human into a host for its offspring, The offspring slowly wears the host down mentally in most cases the host will attempt to terminate any sentient creatures it deems threats to the birth of this anomaly it possesses many animalistic instincts. All of scp 7895s hosts are to be incinerated before the offspring’s birth takes place. Scp 7895 acts docile around personnel attempting to trick them into shutting off the lights or taking their protective suit off if its request is not fulfilled it becomes violent; scp 7895 remembers everyone it sees and will terminate anyone in its reach that has refused its request. Scp 7895 was found in a ████████.
