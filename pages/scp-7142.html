**Item #:** SCP-7142

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation web crawlers are to monitor the digital logs of the British National Health Service, along with any records kept digitally by private therapists and schools in the United Kindom. Individuals reporting dreams, daydreams or hallucinations involving the entities characteristic of SCP-7142 are to be apprehended and brought into Foundation custody at the earliest possible convenience. These subjects can then either be selected for testing of SCP-7142 or, due to the large annual volume of SCP-7142 targets, be administered █████ ██████████ (a minor cognitohazard which renders subjects permanently deaf), amnesticised, and released with appropriate cover stories given. These individuals are then to be lightly monitored indefinitely, and, if visions return, be brought back into Foundation custody. Reports of unusual human corpses (particularly those with elongated necks) are to be immediately investigated and, if confirmed, remains are to be taken to Site ██, incinerated, and reports suppressed.

The entities reported by targets of SCP-7142 are currently believed to be either incorporeal or entirely fictitious in nature. As such, permanent deafening of targets has proven to be the most effective method of containing the anomaly, with no physical manifestation of any entity to contain. However, as testing has shown SCP-7142 to have a very real effect on the real world, this should be considered unconfirmed.

**Description:** SCP-7142 is a recurring dream exclusively affecting individuals suffering with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder who live in the United Kingdom. Subjects targeted by SCP-7142, seemingly chosen otherwise at random, will initially report a dream in which they stand, unable to move or look around, at the top of an inclined suburban road. Sketches from subjects have shown this road to be adjoined to a council housing estate in the town of Harlow in Southeast England. A pair of entities will emerge from around the corner at the far end of the road, and begin pacing steadily towards the subject’s viewpoint. The entity on the subject’s left, designated SCP-7142-A, consistently appears as a giraffe-like creature, though primarily deep blue in colour, and possessing a rounded, stubby body with a neck uncharacteristically short for a giraffe; its overall appearance having cartoon-like proportions. The entity is approximately man-high. The appearance of the entity on the subject’s right, designated SCP-7142-B, has been much less consistent between subjects, and has been described as anything from a French bulldog with extremely blunt body proportions and walking perfectly on two legs, to a completely amorphous creature with a leathery outer hide. However, the entity is always reported to be 2-3 feet high. These two entities will proceed to slowly pace towards the subject’s viewpoint in perfect synchronisation until they reach the halfway point between the end of the road and the subject, at which point the dream will end. 

Identical dreams will then reoccur every few nights. After approximately 5 iterations of the dream, subjects will develop an increasing sense of dread, and will begin to irrationally believe that the pair of entities in the dream are moving towards their location in the real world. Subjects at this stage show a fearful aversion to steady beats and rhythms, claiming that when heard, they allow the entities to walk at a steady pace towards them. Such rhythms include simple melodies in music such as beating drums, breathing (often resulting in subjects deliberately breathing in irregular patterns), blinking, walking, and the sound of their own heartbeat.

If a subject is repeatedly exposed to these sources of noise, their dreams will enter a second stage. In this stage, subjects’ dreams will again involve being frozen in place, though they will be in a location physically closer to where they are situated in the real world. SCP-7142-A and B will then emerge at a moderate distance from behind an object within the environment, and begin pacing towards the subject, again, in perfect synchronisation, until they are relatively close to the subject, at which point the dream will end. Subjects may also experience additional daydreams involving the entities in the same locations. If exposure to the aforementioned noises does not discontinue, subsequent dreams will involve locations closer and closer to the subject. At this stage, paranoia relating to the impending arrival of the entities will become extreme. In some documented cases, subjects have spontaneously and, at a first glance,  inexplicably migrated to other parts of the world, almost always initially to Australia, Indonesia, or New Zealand. In the longest recorded case relating to SCP-7142, lasting 16 years, a Michael ███████████ migrated 21 times to various countries before his death of natural causes. To what extent this paranoia is anomalous in origin, and how much of it is simply a result of the non-anomalous mental health issues many targets of SCP-7142 generally have, is unknown.

As the location depicted in the dreams become nearer and nearer to the subject, subjects will respond increasingly drastically to the sound of steady rhythms. Reactions to these sounds have included: storming out of the room in which a sound is being emitted, covering one’s ears and screaming, assault of an individual who was audibly snoring, vandalisation of a set of concert speakers, the removal of one’s ears, and the attempted removal of one’s own lungs and heart. Subjects will claim that any of these sources of noise, among others, literally are the sound of SCP-7142-A and B pacing towards them. 

It appears that targets of SCP-7142 can ‘evade’ it indefinitely by continually relocating themselves to different parts of the world, though there is currently no known way of permanently stopping the dreams or effects of the anomaly. If subjects still do not relocate or isolate themselves from the aforementioned noise sources, their dreams will enter a third and final stage. No subjects entering this stage have remained physically unharmed for over 14 days. During the stage, subjects will report dreams involving the entities in places familiar to them or in extreme proximity to their real location, such as in view of their home, at their place of work, or at the gates of their school. 

Within 14 days of entering this stage, all subjects will experience extreme and sudden bodily modifications and trauma in their sleep, with direct and remote observation by Foundation personnel having shown grievous bodily injuries being inflicted by an unseen force. During these events, extensive force will be applied to the subject’s head and neck; subjects with longer hair will appear to have their hair lifted up and pulled taut, at which point the head will be jerked away from the body at speeds recorded from 0.2m/s to 14m/s. However, the head will not be disconnected from the subject; rather the subject’s neck will anomalously elongate to compensate for the dislocation of the head, with new tissue and vertebrae spontaneously materialising to allow for this process. At the end of these events, subjects’ necks have been measured at anywhere from 5 to ~350 times their normal length, and in one instance over ████ meters long. Additionally, a unique event involving two Foundation personnel targeted by SCP-7142 resulted in [DATA EXPUNGED] (see Test Log B1). The only other modification consistently inflicted on SCP-7142 victims is the complete removal of exactly 2 of the subject&#39;s limbs, either at the hip or shoulder, with trauma indicating removal through means of anything from accelerated necrosis, to what appears to be laser removal. Trauma inflicted during SCP-7142 events will invariably result in death, brain death, or permanent neck-down paralysis of the subject.

In the wake of SCP-7142 events, fluid has been observed in proximity to the victim, either in the form of puddles or what appears to be condensation on the surface of objects in their immediate environment. Testing of this fluid has shown it to be genetically and chemically identical to spinal and cranial fluid found in members of the species G. camelopardalis.

**Discovery Log:** SCP-7142 first came to the Foundation’s attention in March of 2003 when Duncan Hilton, a former member of security staff at Site ██, re-initiated contact with the Foundation after experiencing repeated dreams and daydreams characteristic of the anomaly. Due to Hilton’s diagnosis with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Schizophrenia (which had previously resulted in his retirement), his reports initially went uninvestigated, and he was instead offered mental health treatment covered by Foundation funds. Hilton’s altered remains were found in his home 14 weeks later, after which point his previous claims surfaced, and a wide-scale survey for similar reports was conducted. A connection between reports of recurring dreams involving entities SCP-7142-A and B, and reports of unusual corpses with SCP-7142’s characteristic modifications, was subsequently established. Anomaly was added to the SCP database and listed as Keter. At time of writing, no evidence exists suggesting SCP-7142 activity before late 2002. Research of the area depicted in all initial SCP-7142-related dreams has returned fruitless, with the only somewhat mysterious activity ever reported in the town being the formation of a sinkhole which resulted in the complete submerging of a suburban home in 2002, shortly after a 14 year old boy who lived there had gone missing.

**Addendum:** A series of tests involving targets of SCP-7142 has been ongoing since late 2004. Due to lack of understanding of the anomaly, many initial tests were simply observations of subjects targeted by SCP-7142.

__**Test Log A1-4**__

//Supervised by Dr Brandon Hunt//

**Starting Date:** 2004

**Subject:** Patrick Norris

**Foreword:** Subject had been diagnosed with OCD one year prior to being targeted. Subject had been homeless for a number of years, and after an attempted arson, was housed involuntarily at a psychiatric hospital.

**Day 1:** Subject reports standard initial dream sequence.
**Day 10:** Subject repeatedly claims to hospital staff that he is being tracked by entities matching the description of SCP-7142-A and B. It should be noted that at this time, the institution in question had been playing slow music in many of its common areas. Subject requested transfer to quarters away from the music, which was granted.
**Day 69:** Subject violently assaults a fellow patient in their sleep. When questioned, subject claims that the patient’s snoring was allowing ‘those bloody weirdos’ to move towards his location. Subject moved to solitary confinement.
**Day 71:** Subject reports great distress due to the rhythm of his own heartbeat. Subject was documented to have been displaying an irregular breathing pattern at this time.
**Day 75:** Subject screamed at staff members for most of the day, begging them to burn down the building, on the basis that SCP-7142-A and B were waiting for him in the reception area. This continued for the next 4 days.
**Day 79:** An SCP-7142 event occurs at 11:03pm. 

**Result:** 14% of subject’s body is burned to the point of charring. Both of subject’s arms are absent, appearing to have decomposed up to the shoulder, indicated by the presence of bones covered in mold and the subject’s clothes. Subject’s neck is measured at 1.5m long. Subject deceased. Witnessing staff were amnesticised. 


**Starting Date:** 2004

**Subject:** Researcher Ellen Leonard, 41

**Foreword:** Leonard had been diagnosed with OCD at age 32, but displayed no other discernible mental abnormalities.

**Day 1:** Leonard reports standard initial dream sequence.
**Day 2:** Leonard requests housing at a Foundation site unknown to her, positing that SCP-7142 may be a memetic hazard, and thus only able to create dreams depicting locations near her if she herself  is aware of her location. Leonard is moved to Site ██-█ and housed in a standard humanoid containment cell to prevent accidentally gaining knowledge of her location.
**Day 21:** Leonard displays increasing concern that she is being hunted by SCP-7142-A and B, and expresses frustration at her inability to escape the sound of her own breathing. Leonard begins exhibiting irregular breathing patterns.
**Day 35:** Leonard forcefully requests transfer to another site on the basis that SCP-7142-A and B are still following her. Request denied.
**Day 40:** Leonard is found in her cell having removed one of her ears with a metal spoon, the other having been superficially cut with the same utensil. Leonard is restrained and thereafter monitored at all times via CCTV.
**Day 50:** Leonard reports a new dream. The dream involved SCP-7142-A and B emerging from behind a statue depicting the SCP Foundation’s logo and moving towards her over the surrounding grass lawn, which was encompassed by a circular concrete pathway. This description matched that of the walkway at the entrance to the site at which she was being housed. It is important to note that she had not been made aware of her location, so if SCP-7142 was purely rooted in her mind, it would have had no way of constructing the dream. As a result of this experiment, it is believed that SCP-7142-related dreams are implanted from an outside source.
**Day 63:** An SCP-7142 event occurs at 3:11am.

**Result:** Leonard’s skin is largely charred and otherwise mangled. Leonard’s right arm and leg had been removed at the shoulder and hip respectively, upon later inspection found to be by means of thousands of small insect bites. Her missing ear, which had previously been disposed of in a medical bin, had somehow been retrieved and crudely sewn back onto her upper ramus. Leonard is missing approximately 40% of her hair, and her neck is measured at 3.6m, approximately 40 times its original length. Leonard was in a coma following the event, and was kept alive by Dr Hunt  on the basis of possible future questioning, and was housed in the medical ward of Site ██-█.


**Starting Date:** 2004

**Subject:** Dillan Mann, 68

**Foreword:** Subject had been known to display mild symptoms of OCD, but had not been officially diagnosed. Subject was a practicing Roman Catholic. Subject displayed no other discernible mental abnormalities.

**Day 1:** Subject spontaneously seeks out therapy, despite having reportedly been averse to it for most of his life. 
**Day 3:** Subject reports standard initial dream sequence to his therapist, at which point the Foundation becomes aware of the situation. Dr Hunt orders that the subject not be taken into Foundation custody, in order to observe the prognosis of SCP-7142 in a more natural environment.
**Day 5:** Subject reports an intense feeling that he is being watched, and that a pair of demons have been appearing to him in his dreams, and are attempting to tempt him away from God.
**Day 8:** Subject reportedly grows increasingly antisocial around his family, often storming out of the room during meals, or suddenly and aggressively asking his family to eat their food in a quieter manner. In an interview with the subject’s wife, she claimed that the subject had discreetly thrown away her high heels at around this time.
**Day 11:** Subject develops a sudden enthusiasm for intercontinental travel, which his wife was reportedly not open to, and she began to feel uncomfortable in his presence.
**Day 13:** Subject flees England. Due to the sudden departure of the subject and his extensive efforts to conceal his location and identity (presumably in order to evade SCP-7142), it took the Foundation several months to track him down again.
**Day 351:** Subject is apprehended by the Foundation. Upon interrogation, subject claims that he had not been experiencing dreams relating to SCP-7142 between the time of his migration until 3 weeks before his capture, and had been feeling a lot better about his situation.
**Day 352:** Subject is returned to England and contained at Site ██. Subject becomes violent towards Foundation personnel. Subject restrained indefinitely.
**Day 355:** An SCP-7142 event occurs at 1:13am. 

**Result:** 100% of subject’s skin converted into a leather-like substance, which was found to be completely inorganic upon testing, being mostly composed of silicates, mineral tar, and synthetic rubber. Both of the subject&#39;s legs had been removed at the hip, with marks left at the point of severing indicating mauling by an unidentified canid. Subject’s neck is measured at 35m. Subject’s tongue had experienced similar elongation and had been largely pulled out of the mouth and wrapped around the neck from the base of the jaw to the shoulders in a spiral formation. Subject is rendered braindead. Subject terminated and submitted for autopsy.


**Starting Date:** 2007

**Subject:** Lucas Rice, 14

**Foreword:** Subject had been diagnosed with OCD only a few weeks before showing ‘symptoms’ of SCP-7142. Subject had also displayed moderate behavioural issues at school. Subject was taken into Foundation custody following the discovery of a digital note regarding his regular sessions with the school’s mental support team by Foundation web crawlers.

**Day 1:** Subject reports standard initial dream sequence. Subject is taken into Foundation custody.
**Day 19:** Having previously been cooperative, subject suddenly begins to express disdain for Foundation personnel.
**Day 22:** Subject reports great distress, claiming that he has been dreaming about ‘the same weird shit over and over again’, and routinely expresses fear for his safety.
**Day 25:** Subject repeatedly requests transfer to another facility on the basis of his dreams. All requests denied.
**Day 26:** Subject is found unconscious in his cell, with extensive scratching on his chest and moderate blood loss. Upon questioning in the on-site medical unit, subject claimed that he had been attempting to remove his lungs and heart with his bare hands because ‘they were so fucking loud’. At this point, subject became aware of a nearby piece of medical apparatus emitting a steady beeping noise, and attempted to vandalize the equipment. Subject sedated.

**Result:** Test cancelled. Due to an unrelated incident involving Dr Hunt, an investigation by the Ethics Committee had him temporarily suspended from his duties. Dr Felix Isherl was thus placed in charge of SCP-7142 research, soon after which he expressed anger at Dr Hunt, emphasizing how poorly he had handled research into the anomaly. Dr Isherl subsequently had Dr Hunt permanently suspended via an Ethics Committee mandate. 
In an effort to save the subject’s life, he was administered █████ ██████████, rendering him permanently deaf. Subject was then amnesticised and returned to the general populace, and the cover story of an abduction was propagated to account for his disappearance. As of ██/██/████, subject has displayed no further signs of targeting by SCP-7142. Isherl then submitted a request for the termination of Researcher Leonard via a second mandate. Request approved.

//Note from Dr Isherl: Dr Hunt’s procedure regarding this anomaly has been atrocious. A quick skim over the early test logs gave me all the information needed to deal with this. The first victim listed, Mr Norris, was unaffected by 7142 for 59 days after he had simply been moved to a quieter spot. Mr Mann was untouched for nearly a year after relocating. Ellen, rest her soul, wanted the same thing. But that bastard just couldn’t help himself from finding out what would happen to her. Our mission is to secure and contain, yes, but those are secondary priorities. Above all, we protect. Why throw away life when we already have two solutions? What knowledge could we possibly gain from allowing this anomaly to mutilate people in the way it does? We might not be able to contain this thing (by God I will try), but we definitely can treat its effects. It’s just a matter of catching cases before it’s too late. I am hereby ordering this item be reclassified as Euclid.//

__**Test Log B1**__

//Supervised by Dr Felix Isherl//

**Starting Date:** 2021

**Subject:** Dr Samuel Bates

**Foreword:** After 14 years with very few SCP-7142 cases going untreated, Dr Bates, a senior researcher at the Foundation, became targeted by SCP-7142. Bates was offered the standard █████ ██████████ treatment, which he refused, and instead volunteered to facilitate an attempt in capturing the possible entities responsible for the attacks.

**Day 1:** Subject reports standard initial dream sequence.
**Day 2:** Standard humanoid containment chamber 14 is modified to facilitate the capture of the entities associated with SCP-7142. A containment chamber of this type was chosen for its relatively small size, and thus increased ease in keeping track of unseen entities. Dr Isherl and Special Operative Cornwall are assigned the task of capturing the entities, with termination as a second resort. Additionally, D-1402 (33 years old) was selected from a pool of well-behaved D-Class personnel. D-1402 had been incarcerated due to arson resulting in approximately £█████ of property damage. Aside from a number of minor ticks and notable behavioural issues during his time in the schooling system, D-1402 displayed no discernible mental conditions. As part of standard procedure for D-Class at Site ██, D-1402 had had a large portion of his memories prior to his time at the Foundation wiped via high-grade amnestics.
Dr Bates is housed in the containment cell and directly exposed to a steady beat of 1.5Hz via a speaker. Isherl, Cornwall, and D-1402 remain on standby.
**Day 5:** Dr Bates reports progression of SCP-7142-related dreams to their second stage.
**Day 14:**** Dr Bates reports a dream involving SCP-7142-A and B walking towards him in the site lobby. All involved personnel are moved to Bates’ containment chamber. S.O. Cornwall is armed with a pump-action shotgun, a pistol sidearm, and a machete. Dr Isherl is armed with a tranquilizer dart gun containing an anomalously potent sedative derived from SCP-████, and a pistol sidearm. D-1402 is assigned the task of assisting Dr Isherl and S.O. Cornwall in the event they become incapacitated. 14 guards are positioned in the hallway directly adjacent to the containment chamber, with ██ more on standby. 2 surveillance cameras are placed inside the chamber in order to observe the capture attempt without compromising containment. In the event that all personnel within the containment chamber are lost, the chamber is fitted with gas canisters that can be remotely ruptured in order to terminate or incapacitate any entities remaining inside.

**Result:** An SCP-7142 event occurs at 2:14am. Camera 1 shows Dr Bates being pulled upright in his bed by an unseen force, at which point his clothes are violently torn from his body. Human teeth marks immediately begin appearing on his upper right thigh and left shoulder. S.O. Cornwall reacts by firing his shotgun at where he perceives the entity responsible to be. The shot impacts the wall, not appearing to have passed through any physical barrier. However, cerebrospinal fluid is ejected from an unseen point in space along the path of the buckshot, which splatters against the walls. S.O. Cornwall fires 3 more shots, the first two of which appear to hit their mark, the third missing as Dr Bates is thrown against the far wall of the containment chamber, knocking him unconscious. Dr Isherl draws his tranquilizer gun, but expresses uncertainty as to where the entity is situated within the room. 

Dr Bates’ neck begins to grow.

Dr Isherl fires a single shot near Dr Bates’ head. Once again, the projectile passes unhindered and collides with the opposite wall, and cerebrospinal fluid is produced. Dr Isherl orders D-1402 to assist him in reloading the device, and D-1402 complies. S.O. Cornwall fires at the entity, landing all of his shots, and with the same results. No change in activity is observed, and the SCP-7142 event continues on its established course. At this point, Dr Bates’ neck is estimated to have been 10-15m long, folding several times to fit within the containment chamber. S.O. Cornwall then appears to lose his composure, throw down his shotgun and charge in Dr Bates’ direction in an apparent attempt to physically wrestle the entity away from him. Then, shockingly, as S.O. Cornwall makes contact with Dr Bates, he too appears to come under SCP-7142’s effects, though somewhat different from the baseline. All four of Cornwall’s limbs are simultaneously severed as if by a singular clean cut, which are then thrown about the room, one colliding with camera 1, terminating the feed. Camera 2 shows Cornwall’s neck growing at a rate of 10-20m/s, quickly folding in a random direction each time it comes into contact with the walls of the containment cell. Within seconds, most of the space inside the chamber has been filled by both Dr Bates’ and S.O. Cornwall’s ever-lengthening necks.

Dr Isherl declares the mission aborted at 2:16am. Both Isherl and D-1402 attempt to make their way through the web which quickly threatens to completely encompass them both; the guards outside open the door and reach inside ready to make the extraction. As D-1402 reaches the exit first, one of the guards appears to draw their sidearm, with the intent of terminating D-1402 in order to make way for Dr Isherl. However, at this time, Dr Isherl trips on either Dr Bates’ or S.O. Cornwall’s neck, and begins to be constricted by the tightening knot which has nearly entirely filled the room. D-1402 glances at the guards, hesitates for a moment, then turns and throws himself back towards Dr Isherl, falling to the floor, locking hands with him, and attempting to pull him free. Camera 2 is dislodged, falling near Dr Isherl, before becoming completely obstructed by the mass. Guard body camera footage then shows the guard closest to the door lunging forward, grabbing onto D-1402’s feet, and guards behind him gripping onto him in turn. The struggle to pull Dr Isherl free continues for approximately 15 seconds as both Isherl and D-1402 are further entangled and pulled deeper into the room. Soon, only Dr Isherl’s left arm is still visible, still tightly gripped by both of D-1402’s hands. Body camera footage shows part of one of the necks threatening to tighten around the initial guards’ arm, at which point he instinctively loosens his grip, and D-1402 is pulled into the lattice of necks and out of sight.

A site-wide lockdown is initiated. As security personnel prepare to have the pre-installed gas canisters ruptured, Site Director Braun orders instead that the door to humanoid containment chamber 14 be left open in order to allow the mass of necks within room to move, thus relieving pressure within the initial containment chamber, hopefully allowing Dr Isherl, should he still be alive, space to breathe. The mass of necks slowly expands outwards into the hallway adjacent to humanoid containment chamber 14, though at a continually slowing rate. The rest of the facility is evacuated while Mobile Task Force November-2 is dispatched for a rescue operation.

__**Video Log**__
**Foreword:** Roughly 2 hours after the termination of Test B1, video feed from camera 2 is suddenly resumed. The feed shows Dr Isherl’s face within the mass of necks, breathing irregularly. Two more people breathing can be heard, one coming directly from where Dr Isherl is facing, and the other seemingly being emitted from all directions. The torch that had been attached to Isherl’s sidearm provides limited illumination of his surroundings.

**Dr Isherl:** I bloody hope this thing is still transmitting. No way for anyone to talk back, though. Though if the on-site warhead hasn’t been detonated yet, I’m gonna be optimistic and say someone must be watching. In which case, hello! We’re still alive! [Dr Isherl glances directly forward, his voice shifting to a more grave tone.] How bad is it?

**D-1402:** I think my arm’s broken. It’s so tight. I can feel my ribs… it’s crushing me.

**Dr Isherl:** Stay calm. Focus on breathing. I reckon we can get out of this. [Dr Isherl looks back at the camera]. So I think Special Operative Cornwall is still alive. Dr Bates, I don’t know, but Cornwall… he’s still breathing. He’s breathing all around us. Each time he inhales we’re squeezed just that little bit more but the pressure is getting less. Slowly, but measurably. 

[Upon video confirmation that Dr Isherl is still alive, Director Braun orders immediate excavation of humanoid containment cell 14].

**D-1402:** I think I’m right up against Cornwall. Well you know… the main part of him.

**Dr Isherl:** See if you can feel around for his machete. I know he had one on him when we came in here. Maybe we can… well it’ll be gruesome… but perhaps we can see about cutting our way out. You hear that, control? We’re gonna need some serious amnestics if we get out of this.

[D-1402 can be heard struggling off-camera for approximately 5 minutes, with intermittent encouragement from Isherl.]

**D-1402:** Holy shit! I think I have it! My arm is so stuck though. Just give me a second. Fuck. Okay, there. What now?

**Dr Isherl:** Try cutting it.

**D-1402:** No, I can’t do that. I won’t. That is beyond fucked up, man.

**Dr Isherl:** Do you want to keep your arm? If it’s really broken, every second you’re in here is going to count. Besides, it’s not Cornwall, anymore. He was a good man. He really was. But it’s either him or us. Now do it.

**D-1402:** Fuck, fuck! [D-1402’s distressed emotional state appears to intensify.] I’m sorry, man. I’m so sorry.

[D-1402 jams the machete into S.O. Cornwall’s neck and begins to work on cutting his way through. The outer skin and ligaments are easily severed, and blood begins to spatter out and flow down through the mat of necks, soon forming a steady stream. After a few moments, D-1402 has severed the majority of S.O. Cornwall’s neck. However, the oesophagus proves impervious to the blade. Blood continues to flow from the neck, but shows no signs of draining fully.]

**D-1402:** I can’t get through the windpipe, man. It’s like cutting through steel. It just slides right off.

**Dr Isherl:** That can’t make sense. Are you sure it’s not bone you’re cutting through?

**D-1402:** 100%. The bones are all loose anyway. They don’t even look like bones.

[S.O. Cornwall’s breathing quickens pace. All about the two, the necks begin to slide through each other like a coiling snake. The muffled voice of S.O. Cornwall can then be heard muttering incoherently from all directions. At this same time, Mobile Task Force November-2 have removed the floor directly above humanoid containment chamber 14 and have begun drilling holes in the roof of the chamber, with the plan being to break the roof through and lift the mass of necks out with a crane.]

**D-1402:** Oh God, he’s talking. Why is he talking? Why is he talking when I just cut through his God-damned neck?

**Dr Isherl:** You hear that? They’re here for us. I can hear machinery above us. I knew someone was watching!

**D-1402:** They need to hurry up. 

**Dr Isherl:** Don’t worry, they’ll get us out. These are the best military personnel in the modern world we’re talking about.

**D-1402:** You mean the ‘personnel’ that a couple hours ago nearly shot me and then left us to get eaten by this fucking thing?

**Dr Isherl:** Hold on a second.

**D-1402:** What, what is it?

**Dr Isherl:** The blood. It’s been spewing out of that wound like a waterfall. It should have started pooling by now. But I can’t feel a thing.

**D-1402:** Who cares? [A large circular hole is drilled directly above the two men, a small amount of light shining down through to them.] Hey, we’re down here!

**Dr Isherl:** We’re… what… a foot off the ground? The blood should have pooled up to us by now.

[A large segment of the ceiling to humanoid containment chamber 14 is lifted free. Light floods down onto Isherl and D-1402 as a crane begins to lift the lattice of necks out of the containment chamber. After a few moments, MTF body camera footage shows the pair at the foot level of the operatives, and the mass of necks quickly sprawls out over the floor under its own weight. However, the containment chamber does not appear any less full up with the interlocking necks, indicating that the bottom of the lattice extends further downwards than the containment chamber’s original floor level.

5 MTF operatives begin to work on untangling Dr Isherl, with an additional operative assisting D-1402. While the men are being freed from the web of necks, the mass starts to writhe, its center collapsing down and forming a funnel shape. Operatives begin attempting to cut through each layer of neck, though are met with the same amount of success as D-1402’s previous attempt. The necks seemingly begin attempting to reclaim Dr Isherl and D-1402 by folding inward towards the funnel. At this point, Dr Isherl has been freed up to his torso, and a harness is secured around him. As the portion of the necks still within the containment chamber appear to be self-supporting, the crane arm releases them, and is instead attached to Dr Isherl’s harness. He is then lifted higher so that operatives can untangle his legs. One strand of neck remains taught around his right foot, constricting it with what appears to be a conscious intent, and proves extremely difficult to remove. Dr Isherl requests a cloth to bite down on and orders that MTF operatives break his ankle. Operatives comply, and Isherl is freed without further incident.

D-1402 remains entangled as he sinks back into the funnel. The crane’s arm is lowered into the center of the funnel towards D-1402, who is ordered to grab onto it. D-1402 exclaims that one of his arms is still trapped within the necks, and that the other is broken and unable to move. The writhing necks then lunge out and wrap around the crane’s hook, pulling it inwards and beginning to overcome the force of its counterweights. The order is given to disconnect the crane’s hook in an attempt to prevent it capsizing and causing further structural damage to the facility. Attempt fails, and the crane is pulled into the funnel on top of D-1402, and sinks down and out of sight. Both are considered lost.]

**Addendum:** In wake of the disaster that was Test 7142 B1, Site ██ was decommissioned for a period of 2 months while the threat imposed by the SCP-7142 ‘sinkhole’ was assessed. After it was confirmed that the mass of tissue comprised of the remains of Dr Bates and Special Operative Cornwall was no longer expanding at a dangerous rate, the wing was permanently sectioned off, and the rest of the facility returned to full operation. On the 1st of September 2021, Dr Isherl formally proposed that his observations while held captive by the anomaly indicated either a non-euclidian or extra-dimensional nature. Exploration missions pending approval. Surprisingly, superficial analysis of the containment chamber by Foundation drones found no trace of the cerebrospinal fluid recorded by cameras 1 and 2 during Test 7142 B1. Additionally, upon analysis, neither did guard body camera footage show any sign of said fluid during the incident, even in the exact locations where it was picked up by cameras 1 and 2. Due to this reason, it is presently believed that neither S.O. Cornwall nor Dr Isherl hit anything with their weapons during the experiment, and the fluid observed is thought to have been illusory in nature. Dr Isherl has gone on record contesting this. 

Due to the high resilience exhibited by the oesophagi of S.O. Cornwall and Dr Bates, application in field agent rope-based equipment has been suggested. Testing has been postponed until further examination of the 7142 sinkhole is conducted.

D-1402 was --post-humously-- nominated for the Site ██ Award for his selflessness and bravery in attempting to rescue Dr Isherl during the incident. Nomination awaiting decision.

**Addendum:** On the 14th of February 2022, D-1402 was found wandering on the outskirts of Harlow town, England, before being apprehended by the Foundation. Along with an emaciated and generally tattered appearance, D-1402’s left arm had been severed at the mid-forearm. D-1402 was carrying a stuffed animal resembling a bulldog, which was made primarily of leather, and had sustained extensive damage, including the absence of both its hind legs. Subject was generally uncooperative with personnel, though apathetic to the point of posing little resistance. Subject taken in for interview.

__**Interview Log**__
**Date:** 14th of February 2022
**Interviewed:** D-1402
**Interviewer:** Agent Thieme

**Agent Thieme:** D-1402. How are you feeling?

**D-1402:** Like you give a fuck. 

**Agent Thieme:** I think you’ll find that a number of us do. You showed quite some bravery at the Site ██ disaster, you know? You’ve been nominated for quite the prestigious award.

**D-1402:** Heh. Post-mortem, I bet. The dead don’t care for gold just as you people don’t care for us low-lives who wear orange jumpsuits. If you really gave a shit about me you wouldn’t be referring to me as a number. Get your questions over with. God, I need a burger.

**Agent Thieme:** D-14… do you have any memory of the events on the day of test 7142 B1?

**D-1402:** I remember everything. What happened to Cornwall and the other guy, the yellow stuff all over the walls, nearly getting shot, and getting left to die twice in the space of a couple hours. What’s to forget?

**Agent Thieme:** So you can confirm you observed the cerebrospinal fluid on the walls during the experiment?

**D-1402:** The… what? Yeah, the yellow shit.

**Agent Thieme:** Thank you. Can you tell us what happened to you following experiment 7142 B1? What did you see?

**D-1402:** Well, I’m guessing you know what happened right up until the neckwork pulled me into the mouth of hell itself, right? Well, the-

**Agent Thieme:** What do you mean by ‘the neckwork’?

**D-1402:** What do you…? Oh, right. The neck things. The neckwork?. It’s what I’ve been calling it. Clever, right? Whatever. Yeah, well, the neckwork sort of saved me from your guys’ crane. Accidentally, probably, but the stuff was strong enough to stop it squishing me. I didn’t really see much after that. It was dark, obviously. I kept getting pulled lower and lower. I couldn’t see, I couldn’t breathe, I… [D-1402 visibly shivers as his irritable facade appears to break, and he fails to maintain eye contact with Agent Thieme] I just wanted it to get me over with quickly. The last thing I wanted was to be like… stuck, you know. Like before. Suffocating. Crushing. But it didn’t. It wouldn’t kill me and I couldn’t die.

**Agent Thieme:** And how long did this go on?

**D-1402:** Days. Weeks. I have no earthly idea. And I just kept sinking. No sight, no air, just the constant feeling of going downwards. And of course all the fucking human skin covering every inch of my body. Occasionally he… he spoke to me. I don’t know how much of it was real or how much was just me going completely fucking crazy, but I know Dr Isherl heard it too. Back when it started.

**Agent Thieme:** Are you referring to Special Operative Cornwall?

**D-1402:** Yeah.

**Agent Thieme:** I see. What did he say to you?

**D-1402:** Mostly gibberish. But some stuff made sense. Some stuff made sense, I just… can’t remember any of it for the life of me. Maybe I don’t want to remember. A lot of it was just numbers. 1’s, 4’s, 2’s.

**Agent Thieme:** Numbers?

**D-1402:** Yeah, like I said I can’t remember any of it. Any more questions or can I have some rest?

**Agent Thieme:** I’m afraid I have a few. To start - was that your entire experience? Sinking through this ‘neckwork’, I mean. If so, how did you end up back on the surface? And how did you acquire the stuffed animal?

**D-1402:** No no no no no, you are missing a lot of shit. The sinking was probably less than half of it. Probably. After God-knows-how-long I reached the end. Like I came out through the top of a ceiling made up entirely of the neckwork. I fell a good few meters after that. It just seemed to… stop. Directly above me. This massive ceiling of the stuff. I have a hard time believing it was just Cornwall and Bates in there. Either way, I didn’t spend too long hanging around to look. I ran. Well, as best as I could. My legs were killing me, and my arm was giving me a lot of trouble. But the place was some kind of giant cave system. Huge tunnels made of stone and dirt. Roots sticking out of the walls and everything. Every now and then I’d run into more of the neckwork, slowly moving about the place like snakes, back and forth on double or triple lanes like motorways. Some of them were black and shiny like leather or something. And always just a little bit off the ground. I avoided them like the plague. But they always found me.

**Agent Thieme:** So you had been inside the anomaly for potentially weeks at this point? How did you sustain yourself?

**D-1402:** After the sinking, finding a worm was like finding a birthday cake. It was beautiful. Before that though I… well I had to. They’re not really human anymore, right?

**Agent Thieme:** I understand. Can you tell me about the stuffed animal?

[D-1402 suddenly displays heightened distress, and places his head in his hands.]

**Agent Thieme:** Do you need a moment?

**D-1402:** No, no, it’s ok. I found this larger hollowed out area in the cave system. Massive, we’re talking. Far as the eye can see. And right at the middle, there was this house. Just this normal family home. It was in absolutely perfect condition. I didn’t know whether to go towards it or not. I mean for one, it’s shelter, maybe food, and maybe something for my arm, which I’m pretty sure was already long fucked by that point. Maybe finally the chance for some actual real food. But that’s just extremely fucking weird, right? God, it doesn’t even seem that strange after all the other shit. I ended up going towards it. Realised I hadn’t seen the neckwork in ages. Figured that was a good sign.

**Agent Thieme:** Do you recall any defining features of the house itself?

**D-1402:** It was just a pretty bog standard brick house. Two stories. Black front door. The door number was 14, I think. That good enough?

**Agent Thieme:** Yes, that will suffice.

**D-1402:** I went inside the house, you know. That’s where I found Grom.

**Agent Thieme:** Grom?

**D-1402:** The toy. I called him that because I watched Wallace and Gromit as a kid.

**Agent Thieme:** I see. Did you cause the damage present on the item?

**D-1402:** No, God no. I wouldn’t hurt him if my life depended on it. I talked to him a lot. Only one I could talk to. He was like that when I got there.

**Agent Thieme:** What else was there inside the house? 

**D-1402:** Food. Beds, too. I found Grom on the downstairs sofa. The inside, for the most part, was in just as perfect condition as the outside. I spent most of my time downstairs though. For some reason I just hated being upstairs. One room, looked like it belonged to the son, just creeped me the hell out.

**Agent Thieme:** Do you have any idea why?

**D-1402:** Well for one it was a fucking pigsty, which was obviously weird compared to the rest of the place. I didn’t so much as glance in there more than once. It stunk to heaven. And whenever I went near it I just… felt this dread. Like it all meant nothing… I just… yeah. I avoided that room. 

**Agent Thieme:** How long did you remain in the house?

**D-1402:** Until I got back here. Must’ve been at least a couple months, though with no day and night there was no way to count. I didn’t ever need to leave. I had everything I needed inside. Shelter, food. And I finally bucked up the courage to cut off my arm. It was broken on the day it happened, you know. Maybe Dr Isherl told somebody. Or maybe not. It was purple, stunk. Must’ve been gangrene or something. I took a bunch of painkillers I found in the cupboard and did what I had to do. I’m just lucky I knew what to do. Oh, and that reminds me. The house’s supplies just refreshed themselves every morning. Always the same food in the cupboards, always in the exact same place. I’m telling you, someone was down there looking after that house. I just never saw them. Or maybe it was just magic. Given the fact that I’d recently been transported to a cave dimension via a network of whispering human necks, I decided to accept that answer as more likely. I didn’t want to leave, mostly because I was scared of the neckwork, but it also just got so comfortable and familiar in there. I had food, I had warmth. I had Grom, too. I didn’t leave that house from the moment I first stepped inside. Until one day, I did. And the door swung out into daylight on a normal suburban road. Not too long after that and you guys picked me up.

**Agent Thieme:** Are you suggesting that the doorway of the house exhibited non-euclidian properties?

**D-1402:** What the fuck does that mean?

**Agent Thieme:** Forgive me. Are you claiming that the doorway transported you?

**D-1402:** Yeah. Don’t tell me that’s surprising to you.

**Agent Thieme:** Not at all. Your cooperation in this interview has been appreciated, D-1402. That’s all the questions I have for now, though you may be summoned for supplementary interviews at a later date. As of right now you will be transferred to a temporary quarantine cell, where a meal has been prepared for you. 

[Agent Thieme gets up and begins to exit the room, at which point D-1402 breaks down in tears and places his head in his hands. Agent Thieme stands in the interview room, apparently confused about whether to address the subject.]

**D-1402:** There’s one other thing.

[Agent Thieme retakes her seat.]

**Agent Thieme:** What is it?

**D-1402:** I went into the kid’s room. Once. 

**Agent Thieme:** And? What did you find?

[D-1402 is sobbing uncontrollably.]

**D-1402:** I don’t know why this is bothering me so much… I… It doesn’t make sense.

**Agent Thieme:** Please, you have to tell me what you found in that room. 

**D-1402:** It was one of those height board things. You know when you’re a kid and you get something you measure your height on every few months? It was one of those. It was animal themed.  It’s just… it was mine. From when I was a kid. All my heights were marked on there in felt tip pen… I remember them. I was only 4’7 at 14. Can you believe that?

[D-1402 puts his head in his hands for several seconds.]

**D-1402:** There&#39;s something you should know. The board.

**Agent Thieme:** Please continue, D-1402.

[D-1402 is unresponsive for several more seconds, before finally responding.]

**D-1402:** It was a blue giraffe.

**Note**: Following a survey of the subterranean region surrounding 14 ████████ ███ in Harlow, England, an exploration by Mobile Task Force November-2 was planned, and is scheduled to begin on ██/██/███. Testing of the house D-1402 exited from has shown none of the extradimensional or non-euclidean properties purported. Exploration of the Site ██ sinkhole remains pending.
