SCP-7811 prior to containment.

----

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7811 is to be contained in an enclosure mimicking its natural habitat. SCP-7811 is to be fed twice daily, via a chute at the top of its cell. Personnel are not to be allowed into the enclosure. If SCP-7811 health seems to worsen, the appropriate researchers are to be notified immediately. 

**Description:** SCP-7811 is an adult male North Sulawesi babirusa. SCP-7811&#39;s primary anomalous property activates when a warm-blooded animal enters a range of approx. one meter from the object. When this happens, an additional tusk will emerge out of its hide in a location that will allow it to pierce the triggering organism&#39;s heart. Once the victim has expired, the tusk that pierced its heart will retract. The process causes SCP-7811 immense stress, leading to it being more aggressive and territorial than non-anomalous North Sulawesi Babirusas. 

The lack of scarring on SCP-7811&#39;s hide indicates an anomalous healing capability, which leads to all damage to its tissue being replaced by new cells within a second. As result, performing any kind of surgical procedure on SCP-7811 has proven impossible. This difficulty of operation will likely lead to the death of SCP-7811 within the near future, due to it suffering from severe brain cancer.

**Discovery:** SCP-7811 was found in a forest outside of ██████, Sulawesi, after reports of disappearances, as well as the locals finding that all birds and mammals within the forest had puncture wounds consistent with SCP-7811&#39;s anomalous capabilities.

&gt; //The agents are situated in a helicopter above the drop site.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Senior researcher Hughes:** Radio test. Can you hear me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Field agent Garrison:** Loud and clear.
&gt; 
&gt; **Field agent Martin:** Loud and clear.
&gt; 
&gt; **Field agent Parkson:** I hear you.
&gt; 
&gt; //Only background audio is heard for 28 seconds.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Anyways, you guys are trying to capture an anomalous boar. If you get too close, you&#39;ll get shish-kebobed on a tusk, and any damage you cause to its body will be near-instantly healed. Because of that, I&#39;ve supplied you guys with a couple of net and tranq guns, so that you can knock it out, and drag it at a safe distance.
&gt; 
&gt; **Garrison:** So we&#39;re up against a boar proximity mine with some tranqs and rope?
&gt; 
&gt; **Parkson:** You got a problem with that?
&gt; 
&gt; **Pilot:** Jump in 9, 8, 7-
&gt; 
&gt; **Garrison:** Nope, just wondering.
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** I thought so.
&gt; 
&gt; //Martin and Parkson are heard laughing.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Pilot:** 3, 2, 1.
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Roll out.
&gt; 
&gt; //The agents leap out of the helicopter onto the ground.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Garrison:** Alright, what do we do first boss?
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** First and foremost, you guys are going to want to find a hiding spot.
&gt; 
&gt; **Garrison:** Understood.
&gt; 
&gt; //The team proceeds to hide inside nearby dense foliage.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** What now?
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Now, you wait.
&gt; 
&gt; //A loud crashing sound is heard//
&gt; 
&gt; **Garrison:** Hey, you guys hear that?
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-7811 runs into view, directly past agent Garrison, activating its anomalous property. Screaming is heard as SCP-7811 carries agent Garrison with it until he presumably dies due to heart faliure. The tusk then retracts, dropping the body.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Parkson:** Jesus Christ!
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** In situations like this, it&#39;s very important to stay calm and collected.
&gt; 
&gt; **Parkson:** Garrison just fucking died!
&gt; 
&gt; **Automated Voice 1:** Radio user disconnected.
&gt; 
&gt; //Heavy panting is heard, likely coming from agent Martin.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Deep breaths, deep breaths. Now that your cover has been compromised, you&#39;re gonna wanna go on the offensive, so arm your tranq guns.
&gt; 
&gt; **Automated Voice 1:** Radio user disconnected.
&gt; 
&gt; **Parkson:** You know how to turn that off?
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes** Focus on the mission. Don&#39;t get distracted.
&gt; 
&gt; **Parkson:** Fine.
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** Our cover&#39;s been blown, and I&#39;m pretty sure that pig is coming back for more. What now?
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Now you gotta go on the offensive. Are your tranq guns loaded?
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** Loaded.
&gt; 
&gt; **Parkson:** Loaded.
&gt; 
&gt; //SCP-7811 comes into frame again. agents Martin and Parkson fire upon it, but the darts are forced out of the object&#39;s hide, by its skin growing back before the tranquilizer can affect it.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** Shit! The darts aren&#39;t working!
&gt; 
&gt; **Automated Voice 1:** Radio user disconnected.
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Hold your ground and keep firing! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Parkson:** Can you guys come up with a plan? I&#39;m almost out of ammo!
&gt; 
&gt; //While the team was firing on SCP-7811, SCP-7811 ended up passing by a rotting tree with what seemed a bird on it. SCP-7811 proceeded to grow a tusk, killing the bird. The force of the tusk&#39;s growth knocked the tree over onto agent Parkson.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** Jesus, you alright Parkson? I&#39;m getting you out of there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Parkson:** (Faintly) Help...
&gt; 
&gt; //Martin rushes over to the fallen tree.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** No time, just grab his net gun and get away.
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** What? I&#39;m not gonna just leave him there! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** This thing has already killed ██ people already, and will kill more if you let it get away. Sacrifices have to be made in this line of work. Now grab. The. Net. Gun.
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** Fine.
&gt; 
&gt; **Automated Voice 2:** Radio user disconnected.
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Seems like it&#39;s too late anyways.
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** (Almost inaudibly) Fuck you, Hughes.
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Sorry, did you say something?
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** Nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; //Agent Martin grabs and fires the net gun at SCP-7811 as it comes into view. The net connects, knocking SCP-7811 into a tree, making it fall unconscious.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Good job agent Martin. I&#39;m calling in the airlift now, to pick you and the SCP up.
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** Good job?! two-thirds of us died!
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** We still got the anomaly, so the mission was successful.
&gt; 
&gt; **Automated Voice 1:** Radio user disconnected.
&gt; 
&gt; **Automated Voice 2:** Radio user disconnected.
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** Agree to disagree.
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** //The rest of the footage is composed of agent Martin waiting for the helicopter, and has since been cut for brevity.//

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Incident 9/9/22 Log&#34; hide=&#34;- Close Log&#34;]]

&gt; **Incident Transcript**
&gt; **Note:** The following incident took place in a 3rd floor hallway in Site-██.
&gt; 
&gt; //Senior researcher Hughes and field agent Martin are walking in opposite directions.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Martin:** Fuck you.
&gt; 
&gt; //Senior researcher Hughes stops.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** What?
&gt; 
&gt; //Martin stops and faces Hughes.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Are you... doing okay?
&gt; 
&gt; //Silence for 9 seconds.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** I do want to help you, please just tell me what&#39;s wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; //Martin grabs Hughes by the collar of his shirt.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** Fine, I&#39;ll talk. You wanna know how I&#39;m feeling? I can still hear their screams in my goddamn head. I can still hear that trampling noise in my head. I can still hear that goddamn tree falling in my head. That&#39;s how I&#39;m feeling.
&gt; 
&gt; //They both remain silent for 20 seconds.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** All of those seem to be classic signs of PTSD. I would recommend seeing a therapist about that. Do you feel responsible for what happened to your teammates?
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** What about you?
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t understand.
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** Who was the one who told us to keep firing against the thing who wasn&#39;t affected by the darts?
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Well, I don-
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** Who was the one who had us hide from a boar, an animal who&#39;s defining trait is their sense of smell?!
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Again, sacrifices have to be made in this line of work.
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** Sacrifices my ass.
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** You know, I&#39;m not supposed to tell you this, but if it makes you feel better, SCP-7811 doesn&#39;t have much time left.
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** Huh?
&gt; 
&gt; //Martin lets go of Hughes//
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** You see, we did some scans on it after we brought it in, turns out it has stage 4 brain cancer, we think it&#39;s caused by its rapid cell regeneration. Because of its healing capabilities, it&#39;s nearly impossible to operate on, so it&#39;s probably dead within the year.
&gt; 
&gt; **Martin:** So all of this was for nothing? Garrison and Parkson died for a soon-to-be corpse?
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** I wouldn&#39;t say it was for nothing, its corpse may give us some valuable infor-
&gt; 
&gt; //Martin lunges at Hughes, pinning him to the to the ground. Martin proceeds to repeatedly punch him.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Hughes:** Guards! Help!
&gt; 
&gt; //Multiple armed guards rush in and apprehend agent Martin.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Note:** //Researcher Hughes sustained minor injuries, and has been placed on a one week paid mental health leave. Agent Martin has since been demoted to D-Class.//
