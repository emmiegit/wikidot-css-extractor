**Item â„–:** SCP-6381

**Object Class:** Anomalous

**Special Containment Procedures:** The propagation of SCP-6381 is spurred on by the increasing ##b46|Red Group## Population. In order to prevent this, remaining ##48f|Blue Group## operatives should attempt to apply logic to the actions of ##b46|Red Group## members, initiating conversion.

**Description:** From an external, human-centred perception, SCP-6381 is a logical irregularity. Internally, SCP-6381 presents itself as an understanding of otherwise illogical phenomena. SCP-6381 is a nerve cluster located throughout the small intestine, in which an individual can be metaphysically [[[SCP-2719|inside or outside]]] of. 

By metaphysically locating oneself //inside// SCP-6381, they may express pro-apocalyptic ideation along with illogical behaviour that they perceive as highly logical. {{Don&#39;t be fooled.}}

Those who are //inside// SCP-6381 are classed as the ##b46|Red Group## and those who are //outside// SCP-6381 are classed as the ##48f|Blue Group##.
