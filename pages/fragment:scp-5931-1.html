    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Item #:** SCP-5931

**Containment Class:** Strife

**Special Containment Procedures:** News and law enforcement reports are to be monitored for information on SCP-5931. Should deaths caused by SCP-5931 be detected, witnesses are to be amnesticized and coronary reports are to be altered to hide the true cause of death under Cover Story &#34;Sudden Seizure&#34;. For the purpose of better containment of information on SCP-5931, MTF-Epsilon-23 (&#34;Fuggedaboutit&#34;) has been dispatched to infiltrate news agencies, local law enforcement, the FBI, and criminal organizations.

Investigations are currently ongoing for the cause of SCP-5931. 

**Description:** SCP-5931 refers to a phenomenon present in New York City. SCP-5931 causes the sudden manifestation of bullets in the brain of affected subjects, resulting in death by seizure. All bullets recovered from affected subjects have a skull engraved on them. No entry point from a bullet has been discovered. 

So far, SCP-5931 has solely affected members of organized crime. 


**List of SCP-5931 occurrences:**
||~ Name ||~ Occupation||~ Date of SCP-5931 Occurence||~ Description of Circumstances||~ Note||
|| Charles &#39;Lucky&#39; Luciano || High-ranking member of Joe Masseria&#39;s criminal organization || March 1, 1931 || Affected by SCP-5931 during a game of poker. Autopsy results were altered, and attending coroners were amnesticized. || First documented case of SCP-5931. Initially suspected to be the result of anomalous individuals from crime leader Sal Maranzano&#39;s criminal organization, which is currently at war with the Joe Masseria&#39;s criminal organization.||
|| Albert Anastasia|| High-ranking member of Joe Masseria&#39;s criminal organization || March 2, 1931 || Affected by SCP-5931 while under questioning by police of on a murder.|| Initially believed to have been caused by anomalous members of Sal Maranzano&#39;s criminal organization, investigations by agents embedded in Joe Masseria&#39;s criminal organization for unrelated reasons reported rumors that Luciano had wanted to betray Joe Masseria and defect to Sal Maranzano&#39;s criminal organization. Thus, another theory was posited that SCP-5931 was the result of anomalous individuals working for Joe Masseria&#39;s criminal organization.||
|| Carlo Gambino || Organized crime figure; member of Joe Masseria&#39;s criminal organization || March 3, 1931 || Affected by SCP-5931 during interrogation of witnesses with the accompaniment of undercover MTF-Epsilon-23 Agent Nascosto. || Due to suspicions towards Agent Nascosto from other gangsters and death threats, Agent Nascosto was recalled from duty through Cover Story &#34;Gangland Disappearance&#34;.  ||
|| Joseph Bonnano || High-ranking member of Sal Maranzano&#39;s criminal organization || November 14, 1931 || Found dead in a locked restroom; subsequent autopsy determined cause of death to be SCP-5931. || First known case of SCP-5931 affecting an organized crime figure out of Joe Masseria&#39;s criminal organization. ||

Despite his associations with Joe Masseria&#39;s criminal organization, Robert DiFortune possessed no threat to either the Masseria nor the Maranzano criminal organization.
