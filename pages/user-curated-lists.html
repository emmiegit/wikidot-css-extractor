+ 引言

你好，歡迎來到SCP維基的用戶推薦列表頁面！因為我們網站上有這麼多的文章（2020年1月時超過9200篇），為了讀者的閱讀體驗，這個頁面被創建來提供讀者們一個含有具代表性的優質文章的中心頁。

+ 如何新增

這個頁面是設計要在社群的參與之下擴張的。任何人皆可遞交他們希望展示的文章提案。以下是運作方法：

[[collapsible show=&#34;守則和建議！]]
* 提案必須包括至少十份文章。也可以投稿更長的列表，但為了讓列表整齊且美觀，文章總數必須是10或25的倍數。
* 個人列表應該加上特定的文章「類型」或「種類」。例如，「最好的神話型SCP」、「最可愛SCP」、「給新讀者的最好選擇」之類的。這是為了讓人們更容易找到特定內容──我們不需要三十個普通的「最喜歡的SCP」列表，因為那種狗屎很快就會變得多餘。
* 看看上面已經有了什麼。檢查一下你要提出的東西是不是另一個用戶提交的列表的翻版。小重複是可以的。這只是為了避免一些列表的內容都是完全回收而來的。
 * 然而，可以自由地對已存在的列表提交擴充案。
* 標題和作者應該要與文章一起被列入。
* 自被加入頁面的那一刻，各列表就不得被更動。用戶不應更改或移除已被包含在內的作品。
  * 只允許小編輯（格式編排、更正歸屬、拼字與文法錯誤）。
* 用戶可以為自己選擇的文章加上簡介，也可以加上他們選擇的原因。
* 不得列入正在參與競賽的任何文章。

內容類似的提案可以由你或當前的頁面推薦者們選擇結合或改動。 

如果你想要提出一個新的或擴充的列表，在底下留言並加上你的選擇。如果你得到了同意，擬一個草稿並把它加入頁面！

下面這個連結裡有輕鬆建構列表會用到的格式： http://kontainer.djkakt.us/collab:curated-lists-box

**我們還需要：**

* 「大使」區的最佳故事
 * 目標是兩份十篇的清單。一個給系列作，一個給獨立作。
* 「浪漫」類別
 * 目標是一份五十篇SCP的列表
* 「謎團」類別
 * 目標是一份五十篇SCP的列表
* 「人物」類別
 * 「D級」部分
  * 目標是二十五篇故事／SCP
 * 擴充社群選擇──人物
  * 目標是一份一百個的列表
[[/collapsible]]

+ 大使文章

用這些為了新到或回歸用戶而設的列表來了解基金會！有興趣的人也應該看看[[[scpdeclassified|SCP解密中心頁]]]，裡面有深入探討各個SCP和SCP宇宙觀不同部分的文章。讀者可能也會對[[[heritage-collection-arc|傳承條目]]]，一個有早期知名SCP的小列表有興趣，或是[[[curated-tale-series|故事系列推薦中心頁]]]，收藏了網站中最知名的一些系列。

[[tab Mario的SCP新手包]]

我要連結的SCP幾乎不需要先備知識，同時也寫得很好，所以我想它們對新用戶而言會很不錯。

（有些人會忘記，但記得要讀文章裡的各種事件紀錄和其他附錄，那就是文章的「精華」所在）。

[[[SCP-093]]] – 紅海物件 by far2，重寫by NekoChris

&gt; 這一個是經典，但它非常長。如果你不覺得你一下就能處理一篇長文，等等再回來看。

[[[SCP-096]]] – 羞澀的人 by Dr Dan

&gt; 如果在你的預期中，SCP維基是一個creepypasta網站，那這傢伙應該會正對你胃口。短且容易消化。

[[[SCP-1425]]] – 星星信號 by Silberescher

&gt; 與前面的文章迥然不同的是，如果你預想SCP維基是一個creepypasta網站，這絕對不是你預計會讀到的內容。中等長度。（在你詢問之前，GOI是指關注組織（Groups Of Interest），也就是基金會有興趣的任何團體／組織）

[[[SCP-1440]]] – 來歷不明的老人 by Dmatix

&gt; 簡單、好看，同時基於民俗故事。在閱讀後，你需要讀這篇故事「[[[Thrice]]]」。

[[[SCP-1733]]] – 開季賽 by bbaztek

&gt; 不是所有SCP都需要威脅人類生命才會有趣。短文。

[[[SCP-2006]]] – 太嚇人了 by weizhong

&gt; 這個SCP最初看起來比其他的都來得傻和輕快，但別讓那騙了你。短文。

[[[SCP-2662]]] - **去你的**克蘇魯！ by SoullessSingularity

&gt; 喜劇！我們好想你啊！（短文）

[[[SCP-3001]]] – 紅色現實 by OZ Ouroboros

&gt; 這一次，在聚光燈之下的不是SCP自身。長文。

[[[SCP-3008]]] – 一間毫無異狀的典型IKEA by Mortos

&gt; 輕快且好笑，但還是很有趣。中偏短文。

[[[SCP-3199]]] – 人類，被否決者 by bittermixin

&gt; 作為結尾，我們回到經典的恐怖怪物怎麼樣？中偏長文。

[[[SCP-1739]]] – 舊型的筆記型電腦 by Chubert

&gt; 我認為這應該作為任何想要在這裡寫作的人的標準。它不會過於複雜、它沒有做不需要做的事，同時寫得難以置信地好。

&gt; 好，所以這實際上不算故事。但有誰在乎呢。在我來看，它是網站上最好的提案，也是我在這裡讀過的最佳系列之一，真的。裡面細思極恐的部分多到TV Tropes網頁應該直接連到這裡。

[[[SCP-2935]]] – &#39;O, Death by djkaktus

&gt; 不管是新還是舊用戶，這是真正的閱讀享受。它十分適合那些只對現存故事有粗略理解或回鍋的用戶。再加上寫得專業，有著真實的對話與角色、引出絕望與懸念的情節，還有一個悲傷、撕心的結尾，讓這不用多說成為必讀的一篇。

[[[we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five|我們需要談談五十五的事情]]] – by qntm

這是網站上最佳系列之一的首篇。絕妙而易懂的點子跟難以想像的轉折；一個我很樂意拿來代表SCP維基的驚悚故事系列。

[[[SCP-2380]]] – 奧斯特加德初級研究員的左腎 by BIDZ180

&gt; 我非常建議任何有抱負的寫手或好奇的讀者讀這篇文章。它成功的原因有幾點。第一個是有趣且有創意的概念。它是一個腎，而不是我們常見於其他地方的眼球、手指、心臟等等。讓人做出壞事的強迫性很老套，但這個項目因為它所帶來的滑稽畫面而沒有落入窠臼，展現出最老掉牙的標語也可能在足夠精巧的文筆加持下讓人大感驚喜。
&gt; 
&gt; 這是一篇短文，那一直都很棒，並在那小篇幅內講述了很多東西，同時也留下很多空間給想像力發揮（但沒有太多）。它沒有冗長的背景故事、GOI／世界線連結或多餘的訪談紀錄，因為它不需要以上那些來支持它的點子。我認為，它在展現SCP最基礎的那部分尤為突出。一個有趣又奇怪的事物、它會做什麼，還有基金會如何處理它。

[[*user psul]]

[[[SCP-882]]] – 一台機器 by Dr Gears

&gt; 這篇因為許多優點（在173以外的作品中）脫穎而出。它相對來說比較短，但它有附錄來充實自己並展現更多戲劇化的內容。它是獨特的物品，有著相對有趣的收容措施。它恐怖但沒有不必要的血腥描述。它是獨立作（也不需要任何背景知識，像是MTF是什麼）但它有數個交互連結來引導讀者更深入資料庫。它完全就是我要吸引假定的新讀者入坑時會建議的作品。

[[[shadow-of-a-doubt|Shadow of a Doubt]]] – by Dr Yucatan

&gt; 對我來說，讀這篇不需要思考。它不需要任何背景知識便完美地開啟了基金會的世界，讓你理解這個共享的宇宙，而不是去臆測它（如同多數故事一樣）。連SCP-017都被以極佳的文字描述。它強調了人類這個部分，設定了讀者可以投入的角色，更是創造了一個絕妙、高度緊張的氣氛，讓讀者想要繼續看下去。它真的很棒──你應該要去看看！

[[*user mlister]]

[[[SCP-2498]]] – The Rainbow Body by minmin

&gt; 不是給新手看的最好文章，但在我的看法中，這可以完美地展現單一一個SCP可以多廣泛。文章探討了異常科技、架空歷史和宗教，同時在分離的概觀與直接的情感上達到平衡。它是一個獨立的故事，但它可以被當成極冷戰世界線的出發點。這篇有時候很唯美，但有一個不詳的弦外之音。這是非常個人的故事，但它有著世界性的影響。我想這篇SCP展示了在符合格式的情況下，你可以寫出多大的故事。

[[[wowwee-go-kill-ursefl|哇塞，弄死你自己吧]]] – by Randomini

&gt; 這是可以輕鬆閱讀的短篇故事，你會從中看到好的角色塑造、故事節奏以及人物對話不一定需要跟龐大的世界觀有所聯繫。它顯現了基金會世界觀裡除了基金會，甚至是異常外還有更多，它也被當作Randomini的Acidverse的開頭。

[[[the-conspiracy-of-sigma-3|The Conspiracy Of Sigma 3]]] – by thedeadlymoose

&gt; 蛇之手作為較知名的GOI之一，讓這成為了GOI格式概念的完美介紹。此外，文章在講述故事的同時，在世界創建的過程中也做得很好，最終展現了另一種破壞格式的創意。
-----
[[*user Scorpion451]]

[[[SCP-2447]]] – Modular Animals by Eekium

&gt; 一篇極度被低估的文章，呈現基金會做著它最擅長的東西：捕捉那些「摘除手術」的代名詞，然後用一連串精密的實驗加上防水布膠帶消除它們的威脅性。這些生物被設定的特性中的微妙暗喻和處理得極佳的收容紀錄是在不破壞風格下，講述故事、暗指威脅和在字裡行間插入一點黑色幽默的典範。

[[[hypervelocity|Hypervelocity]]] – by A Random Day

&gt; 擁抱了網站具有如末日後戰爭機器一般犁過文類界線的潛力的出色例子：一個以角色為中心的城市賽博龐克黑色奇幻動作驚悚搶劫作品，有著豐富畫面與半真實動漫風，讓它完全對得起它的標題。

[[[uiu-file-1997-007|UiU File: 1997-007]]] - by SpectralDragon

&gt; 這篇小文章完美地總結了UIU：一群能幹的特工竭盡全力維護帷幕兩邊的秩序……依靠微薄的支出武裝自己，然後用那墨守成規的態度面對SCP世界觀中的不合常理。

[[*user Leveritas]]

[[[SCP-3008]]] – 一間毫無異狀的典型IKEA by Mortos

&gt; 我在評論文章時會拿來當例子的文章之一，特別是指SCP可以是一個故事，而非只是一個描述異常物體的文件。這是格式自我們開始以來如何進化的重要實例。

[[[dread-circuses-hub|Dread &amp; Circuses]]] – （系列） by DrChandra/其他

[[[SCP-2747]]] – 正如其下，其上亦然 by minmin

&gt; 可以說是網站上meta敘事的最佳利用。其自身作為文學作品相當成功的同時，也用一份被刪除的作品列表致敬其他著名創作者。還有一些像是代號「清晰聖杯」的元素從世界觀內外看都很出色。

[[[Resurrection]]] – （系列－眾多作者）

&gt; 更長、更有野心的其中一個世界線，描寫了一些系列一人物的現代化形象。很可惜未完成，但有不少很棒的瞬間以及較小型的故事。

[[[kte-2013-kapala-mendes|KTE-2013-Kapala-Mendes]]] – by MegalomaniacInchworm

&gt; 融合了各種愉快的故事情節、很好的世界構築和具威脅性的有趣概念的極佳文章。極度被低估。

[[*user NatVoltaic]]

[[[SCP-1730]]] - What Happened to Site-13? by djkaktus

&gt; 這是網站上最長的SCP，也是如何寫出好故事的好例子。它提到許多其他SCP所以它不適合當作第一篇SCP。然而，我會把它放在給新成員閱讀的列表裡。它在營造氣氛上做得很好，有著有趣的動作場面，並有許多值得回憶的瞬間。我會在它如何說好故事上講得更深入，但我不想要爆雷。這篇展示了說一個好故事的同時不流於陳腔濫調的方法，好好讀它可以讓你獲益良多。
-----
[[*user The Great Hippo]]

[[[SCP-2740]]] – It Wasn&#39;t There by djkaktus

&gt; 我以前就有講過這篇了，但只是簡短地提到所有重點：絕佳的前提、絕佳的描寫、絕佳的訪談、絕佳的轉折。它象徵了我認為讓系列一條目如此成功的原因──一個簡單卻同時無法理解的想法，加上瀰漫各處的絕望感和一小撮的「三小」。它也介紹給新讀者一個概念，那就是一個東西不需要具物理危險性（或是，任何方面）也可以很恐怖。

[[[until-death|Until Death]]] – by psul

&gt; 我的意思是，拜託。它真的成功地讓SCP-106變恐怖了。認真來說，我會提起這篇故事給新讀者看的原因是它做到了最好的故事都能做到的──拿出舊概念，抹去灰塵並注入新生命。很顯然，不是所有故事都應該朝這個方向前進──在一個SCP變得無趣之前你只能重新想像幾次。但應該給讀者看看至少一篇重新想像了SCP的故事……既然要給他們看，這篇是個好選擇。再加上，它會提到SCP-106和SCP-3001──一石二鳥！

[[*user WrongJohnSilver]]

[[[SCP-342]]] – 車票之旅 最初by name 重寫by DrClef 

&gt; 有許多可以放到列表裡的好選擇，但我會建議這篇是因為它是SCP世界的好入門文章。到最後，這是一個人要理解一個物體，而物體要摧毀他的心血的故事。這是那種口吻簡單而親密的故事，描寫了異常效應、站點內外的生活、人與人的關係，這所有的元素讓整篇故事動了起來。

[[[xiupania|#Xiupania]]] – by Faminepulse

&gt; 我喜歡這篇是因為它利用了網路格式來說故事，同時維持它的文學本質。它依賴文字來講述故事，而那些格式元素只是單純為了沉浸感和背景而存在。它展示有很多不同方法可以超出個人經驗地看這個世界的概念，讓讀者更加留意，嘛，差不多所有東西。

[[*user Petrograd]]

[[[shaggydredlocks-proposal|S.D. Locke的提案]]] – by S D Locke

&gt; 我原本在想有哪些SCP在情感上影響了我，不論好或壞。這篇絕妙地使用了（或扭轉了）SCP格式講述故事，而最後面真的嚇死我了。

[[[the-only-way-to-travel|The Only Way To Travel]]] – by Djoric

我已經建議這篇兩季了。第一，我認為這是最先真的展現了對基金會可以成為什麼有不同觀點的文章之一，而想要相信什麼的選擇權在我手上。第二，就只是因為它超他媽有趣。

[[*user RJB_R]]

[[[SCP-1370]]] – 惱人機器 by Sorts

&gt; 大師之一，Sorts所寫的經典，這是一篇輕快但仍然邪惡的文章，在小空間內大量地描寫了角色。如果你喜歡會讓你思考的有趣文章，這篇不會讓你失望。

[[[brink-dangerguts-adventures|Brink Dangerguts Adventures]]] – by thattallfellow

&gt; 有趣、驚悚的動作故事，節奏很好，風格輕鬆、簡單。加上主角有著有史以來最棒的的名字。

[[[recruitment-drive-28126|Recruitment Drive 28126]]] – by MayD

&gt; 這是比較獨特和新穎的GOI格式文章之一，試圖幫工廠打下新的形象。這篇有一點爭議，但會拓寬舊組織眼界的任何東西都是好東西。
-----
[[*user Communism will win]]

[[[SCP-1981]]] – &#34;RONALD REAGAN CUT UP WHILE TALKING&#34; by Digiwizzard

&gt; 這是網站上最有名的文章之一是有原因的──它超他媽詭異、它有好的圖片，而且內容有趣。很多文章也有這些，但讓這篇成為入門文章有幾個原因。它的結構很簡單：它是一個錄影帶，內容每次播放都會不同，但整體是類似的，然後發生一件怪事作為總結。這個主要結構在網站上非常常見，而1981成為典範的同時沒有變得糟糕地長。它的寫作風格和臨床腔對現代SCP來說非常典型，除了以它的發現經歷作為開頭，這篇文章沒有任何不尋常之處。
&gt; 
&gt; 這篇文章本身對基金會的描繪並沒有寫到太多超出基本架構以外的內容。有基金會保存東西的站點、被藏在黑條下或已刪節的資訊，他們會施放「記憶刪除劑」，有3級精神評估和四級指導者和O5權限等等。沒有非常難以消化的內容，特別是因為這些原本都有可能來自MIB星際戰警電影，但它的確建構了基金會是怎麼樣的組織以及他們如何運作。

[[[log-of-anomalous-items|異常物品紀錄]]] – （合作－眾多用戶）

&gt; SCP-1981處理了「恐怖」和「神秘」，而一旦新用戶熟悉了基金會的基礎，這個紀錄會處理「怪異」和「平凡」（分別與基金會世界觀和基金會有關），伴隨著一點幽默。還有一點點的所有東西。那些比較好的部分會展示簡潔是風趣的精髓，而超大量的簡潔是會上癮文章的精髓（還有像是，實驗記錄和其他東西，紀錄很棒地描繪了它們的節奏）。
&gt; 
&gt; 如果他們嘗試看SCP入坑卻依然一知半解的話，紀錄會很準確地表展現基金會如擁有大量情報的全球化收藏家、官僚和務實主義者的本質。

&gt; The glass disintegrates. The drones begin to pour in.
&gt;
&gt; &#34;All. Your. Fault.&#34;

[[span class=&#34;h2&#34;]]**9. Cousin Johnny | [[[scp-oct-hub|The OCT]]] - (Kinch&#39;s Entries)** by Kinchtheknifeblade[[/span]]
[[span class=&#34;h4&#34;]]//The herald of a new age for Christianity.//[[/span]]
&gt; The priest, the father, the skinny little man with the white collar and the whiter hair, combed up and toward the side like it hid the fact that he was balding. Johnny wished, quite dearly, that he could reach out and touch it. Rip them out from the core. Tear them out as he screams. Make him say thank you. Make him love him and force the hair down his throat, have the old piece of shit fooling no one devour the remnants of what was never close to a lustrous mane.

[[span class=&#34;h2&#34;]]**10. D-7294 | [[[wriggle-like-a-fucking-eel|Wriggle Like a Fucking Eel]]]** by Decibelles[[/span]]
[[span class=&#34;h4&#34;]]//Serial killers are rarely &#34;insane&#34;.//[[/span]]
&gt; &#34;You can&#39;t even serve the one purpose you were made for, can you. Do you feel anything?&#34; No response except for the same sounds. &#34;What will change?&#34; He broke off a finger.

[[span class=&#34;h2&#34;]]**11. Skippy | [[[your-very-first-scp|你的第一篇SCP！]]]** by The Great Hippo[[/span]]
[[span class=&#34;h4&#34;]]//他只是想要幫忙。//[[/span]]
&gt; 但對，就像我剛剛說的──抱歉啦，朋友。只是有人不能照著格式走的時候真的超煩，你知道嗎？

[[span class=&#34;h2&#34;]]**12. Mr. Redd | [[[scp-redd|SCP-REDD]]]** by TwistedGears[[/span]]
[[span class=&#34;h4&#34;]]//Production stopped for a reason.//[[/span]]
&gt; Redd smiled. &#34;Please, no need for the &#39;Mister&#39; formality. We&#39;re all friends here. I&#39;m Redd open parenthesis discontinued closed parenthesis. My friends just call me Redd. How are you, Four?&#34;

[[span class=&#34;h2&#34;]]**13. The Pit Sloth | [[[rise-of-the-pit-sloth-hub|Black Autumn II: Rise of the Pit Sloth]]] - (Series)** by Ihp[[/span]]
[[span class=&#34;h4&#34;]]//A movie monster, brought to life.//[[/span]]
&gt; All she saw was a pair of claws, scraping against the ground, like a pair of keratinous legs sliding on the tile.

[[span class=&#34;h2&#34;]]**14. Dr. Gregory Greene | [[[ii-tab-po-c-h20-qhs-prn-pain|ii tab po c h2o qhs prn pain]]]** by Veiedhimaedhr[[/span]]
[[span class=&#34;h4&#34;]]//The doctor who conquered immortality.//[[/span]]
&gt; &#34;If I&#39;m leading you along, then all you lose is time, a null concept now. But if I&#39;m not… I&#39;ll make your New Year&#39;s resolution really something to remember.&#34;

[[span class=&#34;h2&#34;]]**15. Mr. Night | [[[black-as-night|漆黑如夜]]] - （系列）** by stormbreath[[/span]]
[[span class=&#34;h4&#34;]]//鬼靈的支柱//[[/span]]
&gt; Mr. Night 是鬼靈的至高人物之一。他是 Richard Chappell 的老朋友，他和老闆共事的歷史比我還要久遠。早在芝加哥鬼靈還只是酒吧的名字時就開始了。我想甚至在那之前就已經在合作了。

[[span class=&#34;h4&#34;]]//He has all the time in the world.//[[/span]]
&gt; Above a ruined throat, she saw a too-wide mouth locked in a rictus grin, and eyes - oh god, those eyes. The thing emerging from the wall before her looked like a man, but its eyes were grey and flat as a shark&#39;s.

[[span class=&#34;h2&#34;]]**17. hatbot.aic | [[[hello-world|Hello World]]] - (Series)** by LurkD[[/span]]
[[span class=&#34;h4&#34;]]//A child of the Information Age.//[[/span]]
&gt; Wikipedia pages. LinkedIn updates. Tumblr posts. Terms and conditions on a media player. An anti-virus scan log. These are some of the things I have to process. Have to learn. All of that noise. Noise. Noise. Noisy fucking primates.

[[span class=&#34;h2&#34;]]**18. SAPPHIRE | [[[non-prophet-organization-hub|非先知團體]]] - （系列）** by Uncle Nicolini/NatVoltaic/Lt Flops/sepiafishie[[/span]]

[[span class=&#34;h4&#34;]]//The mysterious CEO of Anderson Robotics.//[[/span]]
&gt; “Well, uh, I’m not going to kill you, if that’s what you think,” Anderson replied with a chuckle, “You guys all seem to think I’m some kind of James Bond villain when I’m just a small business owner. To be honest, I was hoping to avoid a confrontation like this entirely. You, uh, just came back too early.”

[[span class=&#34;h2&#34;]]**20. The Freezer | [[[it-smells-cold|它聞起來很冷]]]** by Ihp[[/span]]
[[span class=&#34;h4&#34;]]//我們不去那裡的。//[[/span]]
&gt; 其三……我之前說過的寒冷的氣味？ 甚至從顧客用的那一側打開都會散發那種惡臭。在我從那裡的冰箱買冰淇淋後，實際上我還不得不確認一下我的鼻子有沒有流血。

[[span class=&#34;h4&#34;]]//Wondertainment的小小獄卒//[[/span]]
&gt; 我有非常長的腿。非常非常的長。長得若我所想、若我所需，足以讓我跨過山谷。我亦有很長的手指，就如鋼琴家的手指一般……也可以說是與扼殺者一般：長且纖細，非為鋼琴，而是為勒殺而生。

[[span class=&#34;h2&#34;]]**22. Dr. Glut | [[[a-man-at-the-top-of-his-profession|A Man At the Top of His Profession]]]** by name[[/span]]

[[tab 格式異常]]

所有扭轉和破壞基本SCP格式的有趣方法。

[[collapsible]]

[[[SCP-2521]]] -- ●●|●●●●●|●●|● by [[user LurkD]]

&gt; 網站上最受歡迎的格式異常，一個很棒的開頭。全部圖片。

[[[SCP-3999]]] -- 我為一切及我之事所包圍 by [[user LordStonefish]]

&gt; 如果你好奇為什麼這個列表裡大部分的格式異常SCP都來自系列四，這就是你的答案。SCP-3999讓維基知道了一件事，你可以為了寫出好作品把正常的SCP規則都拋諸腦後。文章充滿了夢中邏輯和雜伴詞語。稍微有爭議。

[[[SCP-3043]]] -- 莫非•勞之……代號3043──代 表 謀 殺！ by [[user The Great Hippo]]

&gt; 莫非定律！風格上來說，SCP應該要具分析性和科學性。讓我們看看那被顛覆時會發生什麼事。

[[[SCP-3972]]] -- &#34;Ken Burns Presents: SCP-3972&#34; by [[user Kate McTiriss]]

&gt; 「第一個想出要如何有效地在文章內，用有理且可再現的方法融入影片的人，他會成功從維基獲得大概，十億個加分。記住我說的。」-DjKaktus。3972沒有拿到那麼多，但它還是有效地利用了影片格式。


[[[SCP-3939]]] -- [編號保留；有待研究人員] by [[user Croquembouche]]

&gt; 還記得你小時候讀的那些「選擇自己的冒險」書嗎？這就是其中一個。試著多讀幾次。

[[[SCP-2439]]] -- [編號未分配] by [[user Jack Ike]]

&gt; 2016年D級競賽並列冠軍之一。如果想在讀完之後來點驚喜，把文字複製貼上到不同的文件上。

[[[SCP-3211]]] -- There is No Canon by [[user Croquembouche]]

&gt; 這篇在一開始就會讓你困惑，準備好。

[[[SCP-2786]]] -- The Archetype by [[user Billith]]

&gt; 有很多SCP會在數個迭代之間改變，但這篇因為它執行得成功而脫穎而出。

[[[SCP-3626]]] -- 不要停止閱讀這份文件 by [[user kemoT01]]

&gt; 與3211類似，這篇SCP需要讀者一定程度的投入。你只需要不停止閱讀。

[[[SCP-3309]]] -- 逐漸消逝之際，我等何去何從 by [[user Lt Flops]]和[[user ricog2]]

&gt; 形上學的整體概念是，在虛構敘事內的角色會表現得像知情他們所在敘事的真實意識，且作者的創作會如它影響真正的意識一般影響他們。一定要留下評論。
