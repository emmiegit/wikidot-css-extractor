**Item #:** SCP-3330

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** A single unedited collection of SCP-3330 is to be kept in a paper medium and held in a storage locker at provisional Site-64T, currently constructed within [[[SCP-2400]]], which, in turn, is contained within Site-59. This decision was deemed appropriate due to the lack of apparent celestial bodies aside from the stationary star located within the dimension outlined in its file. Doing so negates the effects of SCP-3330&#39;s passive memetic properties.

Furthermore, a proprietary Onsite Reality Event Protocol must be mandated; A system of five Scranton Reality Anchors must be placed in an equidistant pentagonal pattern in SCP-3330&#39;s chamber, in order to maintain a consistent Hume level around the anomaly during testing. Site-64T is to be retrofitted with additional SRAs, utilizing Uninterruptible Power Source (UPS) backups in the event of a critical power failure. These Anchors must also be configured in concentric pentagonal rings, equidistant to one another, and only activated if the units within the containment area lose function. 

Should the Onsite Reality Event Protocol go into effect without main power, ancillary backup can only guarantee 30-45 minutes of additional support, in which case all personnel efforts should be focused on evacuation from SCP-2400. At no time should attempts be made to destroy SCP-3330.

Media outlets, music databases and archives must be monitored and purged of all anomalous copies of SCP-3330. Replications, modified to remove anomalous effects and memetic hazards, are to be distributed to the public in lieu of the original. Historical records involving the composition and events surrounding performances of SCP-3330 are to be altered and replaced with an appropriate cover story.

Access to the instances in Foundation custody for study and D-Class testing is restricted indefinitely at this time. 

**Description:** SCP-3330 is the designation for the collective works of late composer and pianist John Milton Cage Jr. from the years of 1961 through 1978. These compositions include the //Atlas Eclipticalis// (1961–62), //Études Australes// (1974–75), //Freeman Études// (1977–90)[[footnote]]Class-A Amnestics were provided to Cage following Foundation recovery, thus the pieces of //Freeman// post 1978 are non-anomalous.[[/footnote]], //Études Boreales// (1978) and an unfinished and untitled composition recovered following Cage&#39;s death. At the time of SCP-3330&#39;s initial recovery, only ██ recordings have ever been performed on any part of the collection and, due to the complexity of the pieces themselves, no recordings have been recovered that possess the precision or fidelity necessary to manifest SCP-3330&#39;s anomalous effects.

SCP-3330 instances are presented in a series of short songs called //études//. For example, //Freeman Études// consists of 32 individual parts.

Cage&#39;s style of play was well known as discordant at best. Experimental works involving random note placement, large silences, and the striking or rubbing of the piano&#39;s body were considered his penchant. After 1960, however, John Cage&#39;s //modus operandi// became heavily dependent on complex astronomical charts, using imprints of the night sky to determine note placement. After the attempted live performance of //Atlas Eclipticalus// on ██/██/████ at the ███████████ Center for the Arts, Foundation agents were deployed and, during the subsequent investigation, it was determined that the use of these charts were the root of SCP-3330&#39;s anomalous properties.

Despite the aforementioned complexity of the pieces, individuals who read SCP-3330 are able to comprehend and recall the sheet music at any time, regardless of previous proficiency in music theory, sheet music language or visual acuity,[[footnote]]Individuals who lack the use of eyesight are exempt from this effect.[[/footnote]] but are still limited by physical ability to execute SCP-3330, thus the pieces are considered passive memetic infohazards.[[footnote]]The sole exception is the final, untitled composition. It is suspected that this is due to the unfinished nature of the piece, however, recovered materials show multiple edits and revisions that may have failed to result in the configuration necessary to manifest anomalous phenomena.[[/footnote]] This memetic effect is dependent on the presence of specific astronomical features in locations relative to Earth and thus will not occur in extradimensional locations that lack these features.

SCP-3330&#39;s primary effect becomes apparent when an individual performs or listens to any of the selected works, from the very beginning, executed within an accuracy of at least ~99%. Recordings and live performances must be carried out by one biologically human individual, using both hands.[[footnote]]Piloted drone and other forms of proxy manipulation have proved incapable of manifesting any effects whatsoever. Observations into the relationship between test subjects&#39; physical contact with the piano used and the anomalous properties of SCP-3330 when performed suggest the sheet music was designed exclusively for human use.[[/footnote]] Sound waves performed synchronously as described within the parameters of the sheet music possess a minor reality-warping effect, the strength of which is amplified the longer the pieces are played without error.

While within the range of hearing SCP-3330, affected individuals --aside from the performer-- experience an inexorable compulsion to face directly towards the origin of the sound.[[footnote]]Clarification for stricken portion: Performers typically oscillate between observing the piano keys, SCP-3330, and the piano used, all of which are technically the &#34;origin&#34; of the sounds. It is unknown if this is the effect extending to the performer or if these actions are those necessary to perform the pieces themselves in the first place, as attempts to distract the performer are typically successful, in which case the anomalous effects will cease due to error.[[/footnote]] The reason for this is believed to be a resultant effect of cognitohazardous glyphs embedded within the sound waves generated by performing SCP-3330, essentially used to force the creation of an audience. 

Spectrographic analysis of affected recordings reveal multiple instances of similar glyphs and other hazardous imagery, although this is unlikely to have been intentional on Cage&#39;s part; Investigations suggest he was unaware of the anomalous effects of SCP-3330 until some time after composition of //Boreales//. 

Unlike Cage&#39;s other works, subjects who survive listening to performances of SCP-3330 unanimously describe the music as beautiful or poignant, and may attempt to expose themselves again if at all possible, despite any and all negative effects experienced while listening to the songs. They may also attempt to expose others to the affected songs, although whether or not this is an anomalous effect or a natural human behavior influenced by an anomalous effect remains to be seen.

Repeated or extended exposure can cause exceptional recall of the complexity of the melody, causing affected victims to hum or make noises in accordance to the songs&#39; layouts. This has been shown to propagate the effects to a lesser degree. These effects will in turn intensify with the number of affected individuals participating. This is considered a Cascade-Level memetic hazard and proper dampening headgear is advised while interacting with anyone exposed to SCP-3330.

A number of tests were performed to ascertain the exact effects of SCP-3330. Due to the extreme difficulty in performing the pieces, individuals were chosen based on prior experience in music theory and piano proficiency. Tests were performed in a sound-proofed containment chamber modified with Onsite Reality Event Protocol measures to minimize unwanted exposure to SCP-3330.

&gt; **NOTES:**
&gt;  

&gt; {{#3330-A}}
&gt; **SPECIFIC WORK:** //Atlas Eclipticalus//
&gt; **SUBJECTS:** One (1) D-Class Personnel, former concert pianist
&gt; **DURATION PLAYED:** 0:05:12/3:15:00
&gt; **TEST RESULTS:** Within thirty seconds of synchronous play, area surrounding the D-Class began to dim, creating what appeared to be an inverted visual bloom. After about ninety seconds, the bloom faded into black smoke, concealing the performer. At exactly two minutes fifteen seconds into the test, the Hume rating of the surrounding containment area began to rise steadily at around .2Hm/min. No other changes to local reality were detected. Upon the cessation of the test, assumed to be due to error, the smoke rapidly dissipated and the subject collapsed in apparent seizure, pronounced dead ten minutes later.
&gt; **NOTES:** //We probably shouldn&#39;t have used one of our best first.// - Researcher Ling

&gt; {{#3330-B}}
&gt; **SPECIFIC WORK:** //Atlas Eclipticalus//
&gt; **SUBJECTS:** Two (2) D-Class Personnel, both proficient in piano, operating in tandem instead of a single two-handed performance.
&gt; **DURATION PLAYED:** 0:02:23/3:15:00 
&gt; **TEST RESULTS:** No effect.
&gt; **NOTES:** //I&#39;m having major issues sourcing a single D-Class capable of performing this.// - Researcher Ling

&gt; {{#3330-C}}
&gt; **SPECIFIC WORK:** //Atlas Eclipticalus//
&gt; **SUBJECTS:** One (1) D-Class, moderately proficient in piano
&gt; **DURATION PLAYED:** 0:02:03/3:15:00
&gt; **TEST RESULTS:** Blooming effect began at the thirty second mark, followed by the rapid conversion to smoke at ninety seconds in. Test concluded via error. Upon cessation, D-Class complained of moderate headache and experienced minor epistaxis. Full recovery was seen within two days. 
&gt; **NOTES:** //Confirms the correlation between duration played and intensity of effects.// - Researcher Ling

&gt; {{#3330-D}}
&gt; **SPECIFIC WORK:** //Études Boreales//
&gt; **SUBJECTS:** One (1) D-Class, moderately proficient in piano, Two (2) D-Class, observing performance
&gt; **DURATION PLAYED:** 0:01:05/18:45
&gt; **TEST RESULTS:** After three seconds of synchronous play, the D-Class immediately faced the performer. At the fifteen second mark, D-Class in observation showed displays of glossolalia, speaking in unison in an unknown tongue. Upon cessation, all involved showed signs of confusion and reduced brain function. Amnestics were supplied and full recovery was established within a week.
&gt; **NOTES:** //Post editing analysis shows the vocalizations bear remarkable resemblance to those of the [[[fifthist-hub|Fifth Church]]].// - Researcher Ling

&gt; {{#3330-E}}
&gt; **SPECIFIC WORK:** //Études Boreales//
&gt; **SUBJECTS:** One (1) D-Class, proficient in piano, Two (2) D-Class, observing performance
&gt; **DURATION PLAYED:** 0:14:11/0:18:45
&gt; **TEST RESULTS:** After three seconds of synchronous play, the D-Class again faced the performer. Fifteen seconds in, D-Class in observation showed marked glossolalia, speaking in unison. After the two minute mark, the Hume rating in the containment area began to rise at approximately .4Hm/min. Dimensions of the containment chamber began to expand in all directions, this change going unnoticed by all involved aside from research staff. Despite the floor dropping out, subjects were not affected by this change. Vocalizations from observing D-Class appeared to increase in intensity until the five minute mark, during which the D-Class returned to silence. At this point, no walls, ceiling or floor could be seen through the observation window. Fifteen seconds after, the piano being used began to bleed from its seams, pooling onto an invisible floor. The act goes unseen by the performer, who is intensely focused on SCP-3330. Upon cessation, all D-Class involved lost abstract conceptualization of self, collapsing onto the floor and becoming unresponsive to most stimuli.
&gt; **NOTES:** //When we brought them out, they kept repeating &#34;So close&#34;. They haven&#39;t spoken since.// - Researcher Ling

&gt; {{#3330-F}}
&gt; **SPECIFIC WORK:** //Études Boreales//
&gt; **SUBJECTS:** One (1) D-Class, proficient in piano, Two (2) D-Class, observing performance
&gt; **DURATION PLAYED:** 0:18:45/0:18:45
&gt; **TEST RESULTS:** Test proceeded identically as planned. As the performance continued, the piano bled heavily, masking the invisible floor. According to backup footage, Researcher Ling expressed a rising humming sound originating from the chamber beginning at around 18:15. Emergency evacuations to a remote viewing location were enacted as a precautionary measure. Upon completion of the piece, the piano emitted a 145dB screeching noise which caused all personnel in three times the audible range of the chamber to exsanguinate via otorrhagia. Hume ratings in the chamber began to fluctuate rapidly as a multi-armed humanoid figure emerged from the pool of blood. Danger-level Hume fluctuations within the audible range of the performance caused an Onsite Reality Event, triggering alert systems to power up the remaining UPS protocol as a means of normalizing Hume ratings within the chamber and surrounding area. The automated system was able to do so before the entity was able to escape, successfully recontaining it and causing the entity to dissipate. 
&gt; **NOTES:** //I can&#39;t remember how many limbs it had. No one can. There are eight cameras&#39; worth of footage. We&#39;ve watched them over and over.// - Sr. Researcher Harkness 
&gt; 
&gt; //Boreales testing is halted indefinitely.// - Site-59 Director Grisham

&gt; {{#3330-G }}
&gt; **SPECIFIC WORK:** //Études Australes//
&gt; **SUBJECTS:** One (1) D-Class, former concert pianist
&gt; **DURATION PLAYED:** 0:00:00/2:49:33
&gt; **TEST RESULTS:** D-Class expressed difficulty reading sheet music provided. A non-anomalous copy was provided and proved to be legible. It is unknown why this has occurred. D-Class has the same problems when viewing any other of the affected works.
&gt; **NOTES:** //And that&#39;s the last of our incarcerated concert pianists.// - Sr. Researcher Harkness

&gt; {{#3330-H}}
&gt; **SPECIFIC WORK:** //Études Australes//
&gt; **SUBJECTS:** One (1) D-Class, moderately proficient at piano, one (1) D-Class observing the performance.
&gt; **DURATION PLAYED:** 0:10:13/2:49:33
&gt; **TEST RESULTS:** After two seconds of synchronous play, observing D-Class faced performer and remained motionless. During periods of silence throughout the performance, observing D-Class bled through most orifices on their body. No reaction to this was observed. At the ten minute mark, a number of hooded humanoid figures materialized on the opposite end of the chamber, observing the performance in a cirlce, while one began to draw an image on the floor using blood from the observing D-Class. Test aborted thirteen seconds later via error. Upon cessation, hooded figures physically assault performer before dematerializing. Observing D-Class dies from exsanguination shortly after. Image bared resemblance to apotropaic/evocation glyphs used by other Fifthist sects.
&gt; **NOTES:** //Australes testing is now halted at this time.// - Site-59 Director Grisham

&gt; {{#3330-I}}
&gt; **SPECIFIC WORK:** //Freeman Études//
&gt; **SUBJECTS:** One (1) D-Class, moderately proficient in piano
&gt; **DURATION PLAYED:** 0:10:45/2:47:15
&gt; **TEST RESULTS:** No changes were observed within the first thirty seconds of play. Soon after, a partially-incorporeal, multi-armed humanoid entity resembling that of the one observed during //Boreales// testing materialized on the top of the piano, sitting in what appeared to be a meditative position and surrounded by a translucent energy field resembling a stellated dodecahedron. The entity, now referred to as SCP-3330-1, was docile and fully capable of telepathic speech. Therefore, the remainder of this performance is spent as an impromptu interview with Sr. Researcher Harkness, which he claims he can recall with accuracy (See Interview Log 3330-1A). As the performance progressed, SCP-3330-1 appeared to slowly gain tangibility. The SRAs within the testing area appeared to vibrate as if experiencing resistance, and Onsite Reality Event Protocol measures were prepared. When the performer eventually failed to keep timing, the entity appeared to flinch as if in pain. SCP-3330-1 was then seen turning towards the performer, placing two of its hands on the subject&#39;s shoulder as it began to lose opacity. As it did so, so did the performer, who was seen bleeding from their facial orifices without apparent injury or pain. Both the entity and the performer vanished from the testing area in an explosion of considerable force. Testing chamber possessed high levels of Gamma radiation and the contained Anchors were destroyed, necessitating replacement.

&gt; 
&gt; Another day, another moment of my life gone but for these damned compositions. I can&#39;t figure it out, at a precipice. I think I&#39;m losing sight of my own interests in the music, the passion. The notes and the silences together in harmony. I reminisce to a point where I once avoided the egotistical nature of popular music, the repetition, the stagnancy. Not to mention a little horror of the void. 
&gt; 
&gt; Still, my pieces seem to be drifting toward the main, that rhythm of ego, hackneyed and useless. I have no feeling for this harmony. I remember when Schönberg said that to make great compositions, you must have the harmony. He didn&#39;t think I had it in me. He said, &#39;You&#39;ll come to a wall you won&#39;t be able to get through.&#39; So I said to him, &#39;I&#39;ll dedicate my life to beating my head against that wall.&#39;
&gt; 
&gt; Yet, where am I now? Maybe I will succumb to that barrier and stay on this side, forever. I think must look for harmony elsewhere. Not the harmony of the ego. Something else. The harmony of nature, perhaps?

[The next thirty-four pages involve handwritten music notation, most of which have been crossed out or unfinished. The following page bears a sketch of a nautilus shell.]

&gt; 
&gt; I think I&#39;ve got it. It&#39;s in the math. The mathematics of the universe, truly the greatest harmony. Intrinsic. Ever present. I will find my sound, and my comfort, among these numbers, like reveries, veins in the leaves around us. Branching off into infinity. Why must I meet so much resistance from my peers? I never understood man&#39;s fear of new ideas. Still, they&#39;ll see. I just need to find the material, that essence from which I can extract my sounds and silences and put them to patterns.
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; A man I knew from long ago spoke in passing to me, after I relented to him my burdens of finding sound in the patterns of nature. He mentioned something of hexagrams, which I know nothing of. Looked into it further—it&#39;s a six-pointed star. Not sure what that means. Probably something with maths. Maybe I will roll a die a hundred thousand times. The almost-randomness would be a comfort to me. Not as much as true randomness, should it exist; I&#39;d prefer to remain in fluxus. Not everything needs a purpose. To have purpose in this universe would be—//is//—arduous. 
&gt; 

[Fourteen pages of music notation, some abandoned, some torn out or damaged from time. Several drawings of Platonic solids occupy the space in the corners of the pages.]

&gt; 
&gt; There __is__ power in the numbers. It&#39;s hazy, but I&#39;m getting there. It intrigues me. Surely something in the math, something in the shapes, perhaps? Those shapes... make up everything? These are the core tenets of the physical universe, yes? This most basic of structures. It has to be what makes up the infinite nature of everything. That true chaos, with beautiful, screaming quiet and random things that dot an ocean of endlessness. Novel, forever.
&gt; 
&gt; But—is this truly //it//? Are the building blocks of the universe the most intrinsically chaotic harmony? Solids are solids, but nature is unpredictable, flowing, eroding. After all, what are we but just entropic forces? We will all slowly unwind into our own still randomness. Chaos. Beautiful, beautiful chaos. And then silence. 
&gt; 


&gt;
&gt; I think—I think I am just cracking my skull against that wall once more. It certainly feels like I am. Something is still missing.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ve composed a new piece, //Music of Changes//. I tried the randomness, and the math. What happens may come. I am saying nothing more on the subject. That is how poetry works. 
&gt; 
&gt; Christian showed me the //I Ching//[[footnote]]An ancient Chinese manuscript which comprises hexagrams of random numbers claimed to be utilized for divination purposes.[[/footnote]] today, it is brilliant! Absolutely brilliant. How ignorant I was, for this book is filled with hexagrams as well, of a different variety. The numbers and the shapes. This is the language of sound, of Everything.
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; I asked a local woodworker, this nondescript man whose time spent molding trees into treens left his hands a mass of bloodied calluses, to craft me a keepsake from one of those shapes I was researching. His shop was modest, reeked of lacquer and something I couldn&#39;t put my finger on. Still, the tchotchkes and figurines that littered the shelves captivated me, even more so that the man simply nodded at my request and held up five fingers. No greater than five minutes later he dropped a wooden dodecahedron in my hand, roughly the size of a cherry, perfect for carrying in my pocket. The vertices and faces of the totem were sharp and straight, clearly the result of expert craftsmanship. It was warm to the touch, and even hours later I could swear it persists. In my palm, the shape feels right. Nearly perfect. Nearly.

[A number of other recursive sketches are seen in the next six pages, with very little focus on compositions themselves. A few failed attempts at highly detailed fractal patterns are present, some religious iconography and geometry, particularly Metatron&#39;s Cube[[footnote]]Supposed sacred geometric shape containing all six platonic solids affixed to thirteen matching circles.[[/footnote]] is seen several times, drawn with varying accuracy.]

&gt; 
&gt; Silence is not acoustic. It is simply a change of mind.
&gt; 
&gt; But what lies between the gaps in the silence? Quieter silence? Does the quiet not have its own sound? Like white noise, things and spaces, filled in with smaller things and spaces, extending outward, forever. Yet never truly progressing. Going nowhere. Is that where I am going?  //Changes// did nothing for me, in the end. I felt close. //So close.// But not close enough. 
&gt; 
&gt; This aural experiment, this maddening labyrinth of passable cacophony. I feel more in tune with where I want to go, but I am too confused to know how to get there.
&gt; 
&gt; The backlash I&#39;ve been receiving was expected. Unconventional does not imply a lack of talent. Still, it hurts a bit. My totem brings me comfort, though it does not bring me inspiration through shapes. It feels like something else. Like it isn&#39;t futile. Only sleep for now, worry about tomorrow, tomorrow. 
&gt; 

[EXTRANEOUS ENTRIES REMOVED]

&gt; 
&gt; An strange thing happened to me today. A man I have never met approached me on the street and commended my work. I&#39;m not new to having fans—even if they are few and far between at the moment. This fellow seemed different, eclectic. Odd attire, but a comforting gaze. Green eyes. I don&#39;t remember his face. 
&gt; 
&gt; He said something to the effect of &#39;Music should continue to evolve towards the composer&#39;s vision, not the audience&#39;s. Wouldn&#39;t you agree?&#39; His tone was odd and unreadable, but the next phrase rang out with purpose. 
&gt; 
&gt; &#39;You have the power to create great things. Your music will beckon worlds.&#39; 
&gt; 
&gt; It isn&#39;t my purpose to be the best. I have no purpose. I like it that way. Yet, the words are etched into my memory. What did he mean by beckoning worlds? I only know of one.


&gt; 
&gt; I expressed my frustrations at the lack of new ideas, new experiments. He laughed and said that &#39;When all is lost, look to the stars&#39;. I looked away for a second and he was gone, like leaves in the breeze. That&#39;s okay, they usually don&#39;t ask for autographs. 
&gt; 
&gt; A side note—he had this pendant on his neck. I remember it quite well. It too was of a star, made of a glimmering green stone. Darker than the man&#39;s eyes, but a strangely enthralling piece in contrast to his blank stares. I would guess it to be jade, probably more valuable than my career itself.
&gt; 
&gt; His presence put me in a funk. My head has been cloudy. Once the clouds clear, maybe I will take a look at the night sky. Can&#39;t hurt, right?
&gt;

[EXTRANEOUS/DAMAGED ENTRIES REMOVED]

&gt; 
&gt; It is in the stars. It has to be. I spent a month pondering, researching into constellations, on the brink, I began to notice the connections. I am ecstatic. My excitement was not diminished,  despite my colleagues&#39; inability to perceive patterns, hah! 
&gt; 
&gt; I look at the night sky and all I see are infinite possibilities in infinite directions. As the world turns I see more and more. &#39;When all is lost, look to the stars&#39;. It reverberates within me. Between those points of light lie vast silence. Points, like notes on a canvas, painted by an artist using light and dark alone. 
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ll take a map of the night sky, derive notes from the placement of these stars. That&#39;ll do it. An atlas of the sky will lead me home.
&gt; 


[The next four pages involve attempts at matching star systems with notes. Many are scratched out, but the last two pages have legible sheet notation.]


&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ve done it. I&#39;ve cracked the code, so to speak. The stars speak to me in a way I cannot form into words, and my notation flows without effort. I know what to write, when to write it. I hear the notes in my head, I don&#39;t even need to touch the piano. Everything has clicked into place.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ve barricaded myself in here aside from trips for food. I need to finish this. Thank you, atlas. I&#39;ll dedicate this composition to you.
&gt; 


[The next eighty-six pages involve odd notations and sketches of constellations.]


&gt; 
&gt; //Atlas Eclipticalis// is finished. I had dedicated parts of it to some friends, colleagues, and the stars themselves. Despite my efforts, my work was not well received, //again// and I haven&#39;t even heard back from ████ or ██████ ████████ with their usual unconstructive criticisms. I hope my oddities did not scare them off, hah! 
&gt; 
&gt; oh, I ran into that strange fellow I had encountered last year on my way to the market. He applauded me on my work and said something or other that I didn&#39;t quite catch. I heard no words, but it probably had to do with purpose. I ignored it. My eyes kept being drawn to the glint of the stone on his neck. A perfect five points encased in deep, deep green. Staring at it made my head spin, so I thanked him and went on my way. Didn&#39;t see much of his face again, although I remember that his lips were wry for a moment, or two, before he left my presence. That bothered me. It wasn&#39;t what bothered me the most though.
&gt; 
&gt; Those five points still puncture my mind, their hooks or tendrils are wound deep within my psyche.
&gt; 


[EXTRANEOUS ENTRIES REMOVED]


&gt;
&gt; ████ is dead. They said he was found cold at his piano. Cardiac arrest, they think. At least he died where he loved most. He was a good man. 
&gt; 
&gt; They said he had my notes on the stand. Poor fellow. Probably took one look at my debauchery and keeled over.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I&#39;m still at it, ████. Sorry, my late friend, my music must go on.
&gt; 


[The next thirty-three pages involve more of the same notation, as well as what appears to be constellations that coincide to no known systems in our observable universe.]


&gt; 
&gt; Years ago I said the notes of the stars flowed freely, like a river. I said I never had to touch the piano because I felt an almost symbiotic relationship with my muse. It doesn&#39;t feel that way anymore. The notes surge through my brain, faster than I can catch sometimes. They come in like orders. I&#39;m tired. I&#39;m trying. I&#39;m sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; //Freeman Études//? Why on Earth would I name it that? Who is the free one here? What is your plan, for this, for me? No, I shouldn&#39;t ask questions. This purpose is bigger than me. Bigger than everyone.
&gt; 
&gt; And I __hate__ purpose. 


[The next one hundred and twelve pages are comprised of complex notations and a series of cognitohazardous symbols. Exposure to these symbols cause a marked increase in comprehension of astronomy and fascination with related anomalous designations, most commonly [[[SCP-2070]]], [[[SCP-3599]]], SCP-████, and [[[scp-1425|SCP-1425]]], despite its publication not being for another 30 years.]

&gt; I don&#39;t know why I was so worried. The sky makes sense again. And you know my friend, the one that made me the dodecahedron? Turns out he was the fellow I met at the market. Or, rather, knew for years! Funny I didn&#39;t identify him earlier. He&#39;s become a quieter fellow than I remember, but I&#39;m sure our kinship is still re-ignitable. There are only coincidences in this world, never fates, and that is good. Made it all the more special.
&gt; 
&gt; It was confirmed today when he dropped by and gave me another wooden shape. It almost caught my eye more than the jade, but it wasn&#39;t until he left that I could actually take a good look at it.
&gt; 
&gt; It&#39;s perfect. Similar to mine, but with these lovely points protruding from where the pentagonal faces of the former lay. I think he called it stellated. It doesn&#39;t matter. The shape filled the space of my old totem and I felt something... Strange. Strange but good. Confident. I like the pentagon, five is a good number. Five.


[Twenty pages of the notebook have been torn out here.]

&gt; 
&gt; Please. My fingers hurt. My hands are tired. My flllllrrrr
&gt; 

[Eighteen more pages have been torn out haphazardly. Flecks of blood appear on what remains. Notations are indecipherable. The remaining entry is almost illegible.]

&gt; 
&gt; //Boreales// was more than just music. I can&#39;t --beflr--believe what a fool I&#39;ve been. --Thli-- The notes flow no more. My head is hollow. I thought I was making my own, but it was [indecipherable]. I was being fed. My --plr--PURPOSE. All I did was take a bunch of random dots and connect them. But I wasn&#39;t using the map, I was --mki plr-- making the map. The music made the roads. And now it knows how to get here. All that is left is the tlei obr fl rei plr tlei myr.

&gt; **Interview __3330-1A__**
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer:** Sr. Researcher James Harkness
&gt; **Interviewee:** SCP-3330-1
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3330-1:** I see you watching, but I can&#39;t touch you. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Harkness:** [out loud] What the—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3330-1:** Be still. I&#39;m in here. Not out there. Join us in the harmony, the melody of dying stars. Dancing maggots, writhing on decay, in glorious rapture of the Purity that approaches. Even a steel trap of a mind like yours would melt. //Will// melt. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Harkness:** [internal] I don&#39;t understand.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3330-1:** You will. That puppet that put my thoughts into sound, he drew a map of rotted out stars. Those pathetic, celestial ghosts lead me //right back here//. Following them like a trail of fallen soldiers or breadcrumbs or the blood that runs from an open wound. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Harkness:** [internal] What do you—
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3330-1:** //Silence//. Impatience. You wish to rush the performance? To seek the third act just as the exposition begins? The composer will acquiesce, in time; stifle your thoughts.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3330-1:** This insignificant world you have lies at the center of something very, //very// significant. I am one of two that know why, and have purpose of arrival.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3330-1:** The other is descending upon you with [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3125 five fingers outstretched], intent to pluck this world from its place and render it to less than nothing. It will start here and work its way outward, until all is in harmony. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3330-1:** But I have my own plans. We are Five but we are One, and we want one thing. The box. I want to be the one gets to paint the sky, to be the real artist, while I can. I will make it as beautiful as possible, you will all prosper, until the other envoys arrive. And they //are// coming, with the Fingers in tow. We will make our perfect place and present it to the Great One as an offering when it emerges. You&#39;ll see; ##eeeed8|⌇͏͝⌇̸̕͢⌇̵͘͞⌇̵̛́͟͞⌇͏̢̛͢͞⌇̨́͡## will take such pleasure in witnessing the glory of the Five remaking the cosmos, and then it shall touch the Center of Everything. We will watch it unravel, we will end it all, together.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3330-1:** It will be... magnificent. Now, where is the machine? Time is running out.
&gt; 
&gt; **Researcher Harkness:** [internal] Why would I ever give it to you?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-3330-1:** You barely know. I offer to ease your pain, to deliver you from worry, with what time you have. You sit here and mock my work, blaspheme it. Are you not perfect? Are you not in harmony? We are, and we know how painful perfection can be. Harmony was worse. But it passes before you have time to think, time to—understand. You will not know what true resonance feels like until the Frequency rips your life from your body and divides your soul in Five. Then you too shall be One. Not long now. //Now finish the songs//—
&gt; 
&gt; //Subject failed to keep synchronous play at this point and the interview was concluded. Following this interview, interaction with SCP-3330 was suspended indefinitely.//
