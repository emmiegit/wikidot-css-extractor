&gt; //Six little mice scampered &#39;cross the floor//
[[/=]]

&#34;Eddy, are you seriously reading the news right now?&#34;

I look up from my copy of TIME to glare at Justin. &#34;Come //on,// man. This Hartle thing&#39;s cool, the scenery here hasn&#39;t changed for //two hours//, and we&#39;re still not anywhere near the screamer.&#34;

&#34;The kid, you mean,&#34; Dean said.

&#34;I //mean// the screamer. Could still be a decoy, you know.&#34; I turn the page. It&#39;s ridiculous, but I have to hold the magazine way too close to my face to make out the text, even with my headlamp on. Stupid Can and its stupid darkness and its stupid //stairs!// &#34;I wish they&#39;d let me bring my iPod.&#34;

&#34;But we gotta keep our ears out!&#34; Emmy pipes up. I don&#39;t even have to look up to know she&#39;s smiling like an idiot.

&#34;For //what?//&#34; I snap. I&#39;m just getting to the good part of the article, too, but all this talking is ruining my focus. Stupid language centers. &#34;The screamer&#39;s a broken record, the mask isn&#39;t known to make //any// sound, and the only other noises in this stupid place are //us.//&#34;

&#34;. . . We&#39;re not noises, Eddy.&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s an //expression,// Em.&#34;

&#34;No it isn&#39;t.&#34;

&#34;Oh my god, are you two seriously arguing about this?&#34; Justin asked, taking a hand off his rifle to massage the bridge of his nose.

&#34;No,&#34; I said.

&#34;Yes,&#34; Emmy said at the same time.

&#34;Stop it, all of you,&#34; Agent Johnson snapped.

&#34;Yessir,&#34; we all said with varying levels of non-enthusiasm.

[[=]]
&gt; //One got his little tail slammed in a door//
[[/=]]

We got to the next landing, but as I turned the corner, I felt a jerk as my safety line caught. &#34;Dammit, line&#39;s stuck //again.// What&#39;s the //point// of these things?&#34;

Emmy turned, mouth already open to start lecturing me, but then her eyes got real big and she started screaming. I jumped probably a foot in the air, and jerked my head to follow her gaze over my shoulder.

Cold terror froze me in place as I looked into the non-eyes of that damn mask. It wasn&#39;t even looking at me; it was looking at my copy of TIME. 

[[=]]
&gt; //There was no escape from the big bad cat//
[[/=]]

I finally managed to get my muscles moving, but it didn&#39;t matter. My line was caught, and it was too close.

The last thing I feel is searing heat cutting through cartilage and bone.

&gt; //Five little mice left to make him fat//

&gt; //Five little mice scampered &#39;cross the deck//
[[/=]]

I pushed past Emily and opened fire on the mask. Every part of my mind was screaming (like Emily; Emily was screaming) that I should run, hide, huddle with my head between my knees because it was my last chance to kiss my ass goodbye. But I couldn&#39;t. I had a team to protect. How could I face Edward&#39;s wife (Justin&#39;s wife, Dean&#39;s wife, Sam&#39;s wife, //Emily&#39;s// wife. . .) if I just ran away from something like this and left them all to die (are brains supposed to steam like that?) without doing anything? &#34;Cut your lines and keep going!&#34;

[[=]]
&gt; //One had his little head torn off his neck//
[[/=]]

I didn&#39;t hear the answer over the sound of my gun, and I don&#39;t even know if the mask is taking damage (it&#39;s covered in splashes of molten lead now; will that slow it down?), but I hold my ground as it charges forward.

[[=]]
&gt; //There was no escape from the big bad cat//
[[/=]]

As my head rolls down the steps, I&#39;m at least able to see that my team has gotten away (for now; maybe they&#39;ll make it, so I&#39;ve got to have faith in them), so at least I can hold onto that hope until my consciousness fades.

[[=]]
&gt; //Four little mice left to make him fat//
[[/=]]

------

[[=]]
&gt; //Four little mice scampered &#39;cross the bowl//
[[/=]]

Dean had gotten Emmy&#39;s hand, so I just focused on running. We had to get away. Floor after floor after floor after floor after floor blurred by. I was at the front of the group, but I could hear their footsteps behind me. I didn&#39;t dare look back to check for the thing that had gotten Eddy, but I prayed that Agent Johnson got the thing and was going to be okay.

[[=]]
&gt; //One ran ahead and he fell in a hole//
[[/=]]

&#34;SAMMY!&#34;

My brain registered Justin shouting my name before I actually realised I was falling. I hadn&#39;t even seen the hole in the staircase. At first, I&#39;d thought that I&#39;d just hit the flight beneath us, because I tend to assume that Euclidean geometry works until proven otherwise.

&#34;SAMMY!&#34;

[[=]]
&gt; //There was no escape from the big bad cat//
[[/=]]

It was proven otherwise. The light at the top vanished a while ago. There&#39;s no way anyone&#39;s gonna be able to reach me before I bite it.

I wonder if I&#39;ll hit something or starve first? If Eddy were still alive, we could&#39;ve bet on it. . . .

[[=]]
&gt; //Three little mice left to make him fat//
[[/=]]

------

[[=]]
&gt; //Three little mice scampered &#39;cross the shed//
[[/=]]

&#34;SAMMY!&#34; I lunged for the loose end of his line. I came up two inches too short. Woulda fallen in after him, if it weren&#39;t for Dean grabbing the back of my flak jacket. I waited for the thud. I waited to hear him shout something as he hit the flight below.

It never happened.

[[=]]
&gt; //One couldn&#39;t take that his friend was so dead//
[[/=]]

I grabbed the railing and started around the edge of the hole -- both the rail and the floor seemed to be holding up.  &#34;Come on! He can&#39;t seriously be dead. No way.&#34;

I shoulda known then that I was kidding myself.  I wouldn&#39;ta said that if I wasn&#39;t already thinking he was. It was painful slowing my pace to make sure there wasn&#39;t another hole ahead, but I got to the spot where he shoulda been.

&#34;He&#39;s seriously not here!&#34;

&#34;Come on, we&#39;ve got a mission to do,&#34; Dean said when he noticed I&#39;d stopped moving. How could he even be serious? &#34;We have to keep going.&#34;

&#34;Fuck the mission! Sammy just -- he&#39;s gonna show up here eventually, right? Maybe time&#39;s just wrong.&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s unlikely. . .&#34; Emmy said.

&#34;We //need// to keep going,&#34; Dean growled.

&#34;I&#39;m staying here and waiting for Sammy, dammit! If you seriously think the mission is so much more important, then go ahead. We&#39;ll catch up.&#34;

&#34;. . . Fine.&#34; Dean clapped me on the shoulder. &#34;But if you see that mask, run, okay?&#34;

&#34;Yeah.&#34; I nodded.

Emmy kept glancing back at me until they were out of sight.

[[=]]
&gt; //There was no escape from the big bad cat//
[[/=]]

I think they left about an hour ago. Sammy&#39;s still not here.

. . . Run if I see the mask, huh?

I would, but I seriously can&#39;t feel my legs anymore.

[[=]]
&gt; //Two little mice left to make him fat//
[[/=]]

------

[[=]]
&gt; //Two little mice scampered &#39;cross the desk//
[[/=]]

We&#39;ve been going for hours. I think we&#39;re getting closer, though. There&#39;s a stitch in my side, though, and my feet are starting to ache even with my orthopedic insoles. &#34;Hey, Dean, can we stop for a bit?&#34;

He frowns. &#34;We&#39;re almost there.&#34;

[[=]]
&gt; //One was exhausted and she had to rest//
[[/=]]

&#34;I know. I just need to rest.&#34;

He stops as he reaches the next landing. &#34;Alright.&#34;

I sigh with relief and sit down on the steps. &#34;Do you think we&#39;re going to get out of here alive?&#34;

&#34;We gotta try.&#34; He leaned back against the wall and kept his light focused on the flight of stairs behind me. &#34;That&#39;s all we can do.&#34;

&#34;Yeah. . . .&#34;

Silence that even I could tell was awkward fell. I thought about A&#39;isha. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be able to support herself financially without me, but --

[[=]]
&gt; //There was no escape from the big bad cat//
[[/=]]

The last thing I hear is Dean&#39;s startled swearing.

[[=]]
&gt; //One little mouse left to make him fat//
[[/=]]

------

[[=]]
&gt; //One little mouse scampered &#39;cross the map//
[[/=]]

A white blur shot out of the darkness.

&#34;SHIT!&#34; I had no idea it could move so //fast!// Something that was probably a piece of Emmy&#39;s skull landed on my vest, but I was barely paying attention to that. I&#39;d already started running, and there was no way I was looking down or looking back.

I ran. I kept running. I could hear myself getting closer to the kid, and that was the only thing that was keeping me going. I had to reach her. Even if I die right afterward, I at least gotta tell her that she&#39;s not forgotten, and help&#39;s coming. They&#39;re gonna send in the big guns if none of us make it back on time.

[[=]]
&gt; //He found the cheese and fell into the trap//
[[/=]]

My boots splashed in something as I finally reached the bottom. The whole floor was covered in some sort of liquid an inch deep. The darkness was a lot worse than on the stairs, so I could barely see a few feet in front of me.

&#34;Help! Please!&#34;

I ran towards the voice, and there she was: A little girl with short black hair and a white dress. I knew there had to be a kid down here. I fell to my knees in relief and hugged her. &#34;It&#39;s okay. Help&#39;s coming. It&#39;s going to be okay.&#34;

&#34;Thank you, Mister. I was so hungry. . . .&#34;

[[=]]
&gt; //There was no escape from the big bad cat//
[[/=]]

She suddenly tears a chunk out of my neck with teeth that are far too sharp to be human. I should have thought it was suspicious that she was standing and didn&#39;t seem injured.

&#34;There will be plenty of time for regrets in my stomach,&#34; she whispers as my brain suffocates.

[[=]]
&gt; //So here come more mice to make him fat//
