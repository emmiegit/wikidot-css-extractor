**Item #:** SCP-5827

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5827 is to be contained within a humanoid containment cell at Site-39. The cell is to be lined with 20 cm of concrete with the density enhanced by the inclusion of minimum 33% lead pellets by volume. Present research does not predict the type or rate of SCP-5827&#39;s radiation emission; therefore, personnel must follow Class 3-Omicron radioactive source safety procedures when in the vicinity of the cell. Solid or liquid material removed from the cell is to be treated with precautions appropriate to medium-level radioactive waste.

SCP-5827 is to be provided with reading material from the Site-39 library on request, with the mass not to exceed 10 kg or more than 4 books per month. Higher masses may be authorized by the supervising researcher in consultation with Site Psychiatry. SCP-5827 is not to be provided with any additional electronic devices. [[footnote]]Radiation pulses from SCP-5827 have rendered all provided tablets, e-readers, laptops, etc. inoperable within a median time span of 4 hours.[[/footnote]]

**Description:** SCP-5827 is a solid, condensed nebula with the physical appearance of a 12-year-old human female; it is 138 cm tall and weighs 29.4 kg. SCP-5827&#39;s body is composed of a translucent gray matter which illuminates its immediate surroundings. Despite being visible to the human eye, SCP-5827 is unable to appear in photography.

SCP-5827’s secondary property is the ability to move and create stars outside of Earth&#39;s solar system. This causes SCP-5827 to produce outbursts of up to 3⋅10^^22^^ neutrons within one second. During an outburst, radiation constantly discharges out of SCP-5827&#39;s body at a rate of 3⋅10^^19^^ neutrons per second on average. SCP-5827’s neutron bursts often spike if SCP-5827 reads more than its allotted amount due to the creative nature of SCP-5827. 

The earliest documents related to SCP-5827 date back to the 4th century BC. In these documents, SCP-5827 is depicted as a young child possessing the same properties it does currently. Historical records indicate SCP-5827 was known as &#34;Nebula.”

**Addendum 5827-1:**

&gt; **Foreword:** The following is not a formal Interview with SCP-5827. [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5097 Junior Researcher Kassidy Kara] started a conversation with SCP-5827 on January 27th after complaints from SCP-5827 about recurring pain.
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5827:** Do you want to see the books I got? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Kara:** Sure! What type of books have you been reading recently?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5827:** I read a few journals… They’re nice because they talk about the world and the writer&#39;s life. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Kara:** Yeah, journals are very fun to read. Did you know that I keep a journal?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5827:** Really? Is it fun to write? //(It sits up, cocking its head to its right.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Kara:** //(They giggle.)// You could say that. What other types of books do you like to read?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5827:** I read some of the science ones, but a few of the words are too hard.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Kara:** Yeah, I had that issue too when I was first starting out.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5827:** How did you get past it?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Kara:** I had some people to help me, and I practiced a lot. 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5827:** //(It gasps.)// Could you help me soon?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Kara:** //(Nods.)// Of course.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5827:** Um... Can I talk to you about something, Dr. Kara? //(It pauses, taking a second to see a reaction.)// Sometimes, my head starts to hurt and I feel like... I need to move the stars.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Kara:** What do you mean?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5827:** My head feels like it&#39;s gonna explode when I do. It never used to do this when I was free.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Kara:** Oh… What did you do when you were free?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5827:** I would create things. Stars, they are always very pretty. I loved looking at them. So I created more. Those stars create planets and other really pretty things. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Kara:** So you would make things that were pretty?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5827:** Yeah! It&#39;s like, uh, creating things. Like writing or drawing, it&#39;s fun. But, sometimes they beg me to see them again.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Kara:** That’s cool, I enjoy looking at the stars too.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5827:** I just need to help them… My body hurts when I try.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Kara:** I know. I’ll try to work something out for you, is that alright Nebula?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5827:** //(It nods, smiling at Dr. Kara.)// Thank you!
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** SCP-5827 continues to express pain when its radiation is present. Currently there is no plan to research the effects of SCP-5827 on the outside world despite previous proposals.

Dear Journal,

Doctor Kara is a kind person. Although, they can’t stop feeling like they&#39;re talking to a ten-year-old. They’ve read my file and know that I’m over 800,000, but it still feels weird. It’s very understandable, since I’m very very young even for a star. They’re always super kind when they hang out with me. They even got me this journal! Unfortunately, they go somewhere else after April, some sort of Junior Researcher rotation or something. I dislike it because they’ve been so nice. 
@@ @@
But I worry about them… Doctor Kara is stressing out about a lot. They have a girlfriend who&#39;s going through a rough time with the Foundation. I hope they work it out. It would suck to have that type of thing happen. 
@@ @@
I recently asked them about it, and they acted surprised and asked me how I knew. We were both surprised, since I didn&#39;t know how I knew that. I just did?
@@ @@
Anyway, it&#39;s kind of lonely in containment. I miss the stars, I don’t even get to see them anymore. They pull me to them, but every time I try to play with them or give them more friends my room gets all hot and my body feels like it&#39;s being torn apart. It&#39;s not fun.

Lights out! Night night journal, sleep good. [[/size]]

**Addendum 5827-2:**

&gt; **Foreword:** Follow-up on SCP-5827&#39;s complaints that pain has gotten worse in the last month from. 
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;Begin Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Kara:** Nebula, can I ask you a few questions?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5827:** Hi Dr. Kara! 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Kara:** //(They pull out a laminated pain chart.)// What number would you say is the pain you feel right now?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5827:** //(It puts its left hand to its cheek.)// Uhh, a three.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Kara:** Alright, that&#39;s bearable. //(They frown and look at their notes.)// So when you try to move the stars and can’t, what number is it then?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5827:** 10. It hurts. //(It shakes its head looking down, tears welling in its eyes.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Kara:** Hmm, where does it hurt?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5827:**  Everywhere, but my head hurts the worst.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Kara:** Alright, how often does this happen?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5827:** A lot. The stars need me…  //(Its nose starts dripping glowing blood. It notices and starts wailing)// 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Kara:** Oh! Ok, ok. Let&#39;s get you cleaned up. It&#39;s going to be ok. //(They stand up to help SCP-5827.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5827:** Ok… //(It stands up as it starts crying.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **&lt;End Log&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; **Closing Statement:** SCP-5827 continues to express extreme pain while experiencing its properties. SCP-5827 has not been observed to bleed before; this bleeding has continued from its nose, mouth, ears, eyes, and palms. Site psychiatry and medical staff have been investigating possible solutions.
