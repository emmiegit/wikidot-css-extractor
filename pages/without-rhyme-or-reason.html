Between the 72nd and 73rd pillars of the left side of the Memorial Atrium is a rather nice wall. It&#39;s composed of a sturdy wood -- oak, perhaps -- and it makes a pleasing sound when you rap on it with your knuckles. It would smell nice if you put your nose up to it, but that would be odd, no?

Numerous papers are haphazardly affixed to it with similarly sturdy iron nails. Some are mere scraps of parchment bearing an illegible scrawl, some are lengthy scrolls in beautiful calligraphy that roll down the wall and traverse the soft green carpet. Mind your feet, lest you trip. Your fellow patrons pause their travels to inspect the bulletins, although removing them is quite impossible. I&#39;m sure the more vertically inclined among them would lift you up to read those posted higher on the wall if you asked nicely. Looking at it as is, there are a choice few things you can make out.

Of course, as it would any Wanderer worth their salt, this begs the question:

[[collapsible show=&#34;So what is all this?&#34; hide=&#34;Does it look like I know?&#34;]]
[[div class=&#34;oldblock&#34;]]
+ Howdy.

I&#39;m Spoddet, and this is my page. You probably knew that already. What you might not know is that you can find me on the Wanderer&#39;s Library Discord -- spoddet -- as well as on here (shoot me a message if you need to, I don&#39;t mind.) I like reading, writing, indie games, and excessively talking about all three.

Oh, and please use she/her pronouns. I ran out of Wikidot name changes.
