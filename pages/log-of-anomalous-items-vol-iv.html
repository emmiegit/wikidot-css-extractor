&gt;  **Foreword:** The SCP Foundation has discovered a substantial number of items which are simply too useless to merit further attention. This document lists those items which have prompted some curiosity. It may be used as a resource should knowledge of these items become useful or necessary in the future.  
&gt; – Dr. █████ █████, Head of Research, Site-██
This is the fourth volume of the log. Due to the increasing number of items discovered by the Foundation, this list is no longer open to new entries. For ease of archival, [[[log-of-anomalous-items | first]]], [[[log-of-anomalous-items-vol-ii | second]]] and [[[log-of-anomalous-items-vol-iii | third]]] volumes of this log have been made available, and the [[[log-of-anomalous-items-vol-v | fifth]]] remains open to new additions.

Lists of [[[log-of-extranormal-events| Extranormal Events]]] and [[[log-of-unexplained-locations| Unexplained Locations]]] have also been compiled.

**Date of Recovery:** 05-03-2020
**Location of Recovery:** [REDACTED]
**Current Status:** Kept in a containment locker in Site-91.


**Item Description:** A set of 15 dumbbells, each weighing 15 lbs. When picked up, the weights on the dumbbell will begin changing to different colors despite being made of pure steel. Each weight has engraved letters reading &#34;Need a switch from your old name-brand ███████ weights? Well, do we have the solution for you (ᵔᴥᵔ)!  Kobayashi Athletics&#39; Dance Dumbbells! ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ&#34;
**Date of Recovery:** 7-12-2015
**Location of Recovery:** Site-82
**Current Status:** In the break room of Site-82.
**Note:** //At the time of discovery, we had the exact same brand of weights engraved on those dumbbells. We also discovered that multiple staff had lost money from their wallets. In total, the lost money added up to $150.// -Researcher Voute

**Item Description:** A group of 3 levitating blue plastic beach balls. Each ball has the ability to produce sounds of various species in the Cetacea Order at random intervals. The sound produced by the balls originates from an unknown source. The sounds have a memetic effect on anyone who has heard it. They will refer to the balls as &#34;cute&#34; or &#34;adorable&#34;. All beach balls have a note titled &#34;Cetacean Orbs by ███████ ███████&#34; 
**Date of Recovery:** 1-11-2021
**Location of Recovery:** A storage room in a dolphinarium in Pattaya City, Thailand. It was discovered after the balls are used as props in a dolphin show.
**Current Status:** Stored in a storage room in Site Deltaphin, Department of Cetacean Research and Containment. 

**Item Description:** A mechanical common raccoon (//Procyon lotor//) of an appropriate size for an adult of its species.  The item is made of incredibly complex clockwork, and becomes animate for a period of a few minutes to several hours upon winding a small key at the back of its neck.  If the clockwork is allowed to wind down, the item does not appear aware of missing time once wound again.  The length of its animation is dependent on how long the key is turned.  When animate, the item acts typically of a biological raccoon, even consuming food and excreting waste.  How this occurs cannot be determined without dismantling the item, which, due to its complexity, is likely to cause irreversible damage.
**Date of Recovery:** 13/08/2022
**Location of Recovery:** Found in an abandoned thrift store, San Diego, CA
**Current Status:** Being kept as a pet by Researcher Somerset.

**Item Description:** The skeletal remains of a domestic house cat (//Felis catus//). However, every other day, the remains will re-animate and the object will act and behave like other specimens of its species. It’s been observed that if the object re-animates on January 4th or August 12th, the object will have all the features of a normal living specimen of Felis Catus. 
**Date of Recovery:** 07/05/1995
**Location of Recovery:** Given to the Foundation by Wilson Wildlife Solutions as a “gift”, original owner unknown and investigations ongoing. 
**Current Status:** Being kept as a “pet” by Site Director Tilda Moose.
Note: Every time the object has re-animated, the object has been wearing a pet collar and name tag which has been engraved with the word Schrödinger.

**Item Description:** Regulation table tennis ball, blue in color.  Item generates a wireless network with standard connectivity and no security requirements.  The mechanism by which this occurs is not known.
**Date of Recovery:** 14/08/2022
**Location of Recovery:** Found at a cafe believed to be a meeting place for GOI Are We Cool Yet.
**Current Status:** In low-value item storage.

**Item Description:** Stainless steel laser pointer with attached key chain. When any creature, other than its wielder, perceives the ‘dot’ created by this laser pointer, it will feel a compulsion to chase after and attack it. The influence of this item seems to be greater in targets with a history of addictive personality. In some cases, the target is willing to expose themselves to danger in order to chase the ‘dot’ and may continue to chase it after sustaining injuries. 
**Date of Recovery:** 17/08/2022
**Location of Recovery:** █████████, England. The laser pointer was found within cardboard packaging identifying it as “Dr Wondertainment’s Captivating Laser Shooter”. This box also contained an illustrated instructional pamphlet for using the device “responsibly”.  
**Current Status:** In possession of Dr. Lewis Naylor.
**Notes:** Currently awaiting permission to classify this item as a Thaumiel class SCP.
+++ Anomalous Items 761 - 770  
**Item Description**: A Bosch &#39;Diamond Core&#39; electric drill. Objects being bored by it will spin at the same direction and speed of the drill bit as if they were stuck. Size, weight, and density do not change this phenomenon and any obstructions will always be pushed or destroyed. The longer the object is spun, the higher the chance of it being launched out of the drill bit.
**Date of Recovery**: 2021/12/11 (Two-thousand-twenty-one, Twelveth of November)
**Location of Recovery**: Site-78&#39;s technical workshop.
**Current Status**: Neutralized. See related test-log.

**Item Description:** Containment Chamber 17 in Wing A of Site-517. Item is completely mundane; however, there appears to be an ongoing rumor among site staff that it is anomalous. Furthermore, some personnel (including high-ranking senior staff) have expressed concern that the item will be capable of causing an XK-Class End-Of-The-World scenario in the near future. These rumors are not the result of any memetic effect, and repeated scans of the chamber have yielded nothing of note. Despite this, the item has been given an anomalous item designation for the time being.
**Date of Recovery:** 2003/03/03
**Location of Recovery:** Site-517.
**Current Status:** Still connected to Site-517. Item is not currently in use.

**Item Description:** A portrait of a young woman, with a painting style reminiscent of the 70’s. When a subject walks through the portrait, they will be transported exactly 15 years into the past, to a location of personal significance to them. Actions performed in the past follow the Novikov self-consistency principle; past events that subjects attempt to avert will happen anyways, often because of the attempted aversion.
**Date of Recovery:** 1992/09/12
**Location of Recovery:**  Abandoned storage locker in Chicago, Ohio. Signs of recent habitation were present, along with a note saying, “I miss you. I just want to be with you again.”
**Current Status:** --In storage.-- Presumed destroyed following the decommissioning of SCP-████-D.

**Item Description:** A wireless flat-screen television. Regardless of original content, all humans displayed on the screen appear identical to prominent American actor Christopher Pratt. Animated or nonhuman characters are are not affected visually but are audibly identical to Pratt.
**Date of Recovery:** ██/12/2022
**Location of Recovery:** Warehouse belonging to an unknown and potentially anomalous marketing company. Object was connected to a laptop computer containing a copy of Adobe Photoshop, as well as a Bing Images tab containing images of Pratt.
**Current Status:** In storage. Object can be requisitioned for any Site break-room; this has yet to occur.

**Item Description:** Potted ficus plant, slightly larger than usual. Appears non-anomalous upon inspection, and testing has yet to reveal any anomalous property. However, the location it was found in has no record of the plant being acquired at any point in its history. Those present at the location claim the plant has &#34;always been there&#34;; however, available surveillance camera videos show the plant was acquired at some point between 5 and 6 years ago. Even those who have been working at the location since before this point have no recollection of a time when the plant was not present, and will mention the plant when describing their memories of the past.
**Date of Recovery:** 21-12-2021
**Location of Recovery:** Office building belonging to Sapling &amp; Imagery Data Systems, which was later discovered not to exist. Extensive searches of all available databases provided no results; use of publicly available search engines such as Google or Bing also provides no results.
**Current Status:** Being considered for potential SCP designation. Research into the nonexistent company Sapling &amp; Imagery is continuing.

**Item Description:** A small instructional booklet titled //Easy Jazz Chords for Beginners,// which claims to display guitar fingerings for jazz music easy for anyone to perform.

[[/module]]**Item Description:** An orange (scientific name //citrus sinensis//) which, within 10 seconds, reappears within 4 m of the most recent location it was destroyed. Anyone who knows about it is incapable of remembering any location it has ever been in unless they are actively looking at it. Eating the orange provides no nutritional value and the orange adds no mass to anything it is placed upon. It tastes like a non anomalous orange but cannot be identified via scent. Machine learning algorithms have been used to identify some of its properties, as it does not appear to anomalously affect footage taken of it. Photons in general also appear unaffected. While cooled to at 4 degrees C or below, decay is unable to occur indefinitely.
**Date Of Recovery:** 1/24/2021
**Location Of Recovery:** Unknown.
**Current Status:** In a refrigerator, somewhere. Consult the file in Unit-9305 of Area-256 for further information. The orange is to be monitored at all times by a camera observing the refrigerator.
//Notes: Keep it out of the cafeteria, please.//

**Item Description:** Metal coin, made of bronze.  One side of the coin shows an instrument similar to a violin surrounded by symbols in an unidentified language; the other shows the head of a rabbit, staring directly at the viewer.  No indication of a date of manufacture could be located, but testing of the metal reveals that it was forged sometime between 1450 and 1482 CE.
**Date of Recovery:** 12/12/2021
**Location of Recovery:** A secondhand store in Seattle, WA
**Current Status:** In storage.
**Note:** //The store&#39;s owner had recently inherited the store and all inventory from a relative, and was unaware of the coin&#39;s provenance.  Strangely, available inventory records had no indication of the coin ever being acquired.  The owner suggested that it might have belonged to the original owner, but was unable to verify this, claiming he rarely saw the original owner.//
+++ Anomalous Items 891 - 900
**Item Description:** Blue and white folding umbrella.  When unfolded, a small bird or mammal will manifest and fall out of the umbrella.  They behave as expected for their species, and have been confirmed to be non-anomalous.

**Item Description:** Small notebook with cover art depicting the ocean.  When touched by a human subject, the pages immediately become filled with detailed descriptions of the subject&#39;s most embarrassing moments, written in unknown handwriting.  When contact with the item is broken, the pages slowly become blank over 60 seconds.  Subjects become defensive and try to hide the book if others attempt to read over their shoulder, but this is believed to be due to the subject matter rather than any anomalous effect.
**Date of Recovery:** 28/10/2022
**Location of Recovery:** On the floor next to a trash can in Grand Central Station, NYC, NY
**Current Status:** In low-value item storage.

**Item Description:** A blanket where its size changes to the size of the bed it&#39;s on. If someone were to get under it, a hole would form where the person&#39;s feet are. If the person removes their feet from under the blanket, the hole repairs itself. If it&#39;s not on a bed or is removed, it does not exhibit these anomalous properties.

+++ Anomalous Items 901 - 910

**Item Description:** A small batch of Class-A amnestics that, when administered, cause the individual attempting to administer them to be affected rather than the subject being given them. This held true no matter how they were administered, even after being removed from their syringes. When a test was done to see what would happen when someone attempted to administer them to themselves, the Doctor that ordered the test felt the effects instead. The syringes themselves show no anomalous properties.
**Date of Recovery:** 21-08-2021
**Location of Recovery:** Site-322; discovered following attempts to amnestitize a witness to [[[SCP-6598]]]&#39;s containment breach.
**Current Status:** Syringes were emptied and properly disposed of in sharps containers. Amnestic solution was then neutralized. Resulting liquid showed no anomalous properties.
**Notes:** //The individuals responsible for producing this batch of amnestics are pending investigation.//

**Item Description:** A stethoscope that is always cold to the touch, especially when used for its intended purpose. A cognitohazardous effect causes anyone it is used on properly to feel as though it is much colder than it actually is, usually described to be &#34;three times as cold&#34;. Tests have shown that the stethoscope gets colder every time it makes contact with skin, and it can never be warmed up, Currently, the stethoscope measures 7.8℃.
**Date of Recovery:** 05-02-2012
**Location of Recovery:** ████ Health Office, Bear, Delaware
**Current Status:** Held in low-value storage. Further testing as a potential means of indefinite cold storage pending.

**Item Description:** A thin 50 gram cellophane baggie of //nepeta cataria// (catnip). Despite the bag being completely sealed, it can be smelt by anyone within approximately 5 meters. The smell has a memetic influence on all living creatures exposed to the scent for more than 5 minutes. These effects are typical for heavy exposure to //tetrahydrocannabinol// (THC), the main contributor to intoxication from the use of cannabis, and drug tests during exposure indicate a positive reading for THC use. These effects, however, go away immediately after short term exposure. Long term exposure has been shown to instill mild permanent influence.
**Date of Recovery:** 26-08-2022
**Location of Recovery:** Found on the shelf of a pet store in Rehoboth Beach, New Jersey. Store employees knew nothing about the baggie, and CCTV footage showed no signs of its placement.
**Current Status:** --Stored in an airtight container in a secure locker-- --Being studied by Dr. Frisk-- [EXPUNGED], Presumably eaten by Dr. Frisk 
**Note.** //Dr. Frisk is undergoing investigation after expunging information on the item&#39;s whereabouts. Item was last seen being taken into his personal office. When he was next seen, his mouth was full, his breath reeked of catnip, and he failed a drug test due to THC exposure. He is currently on unpaid leave as his punishment is decided.//

**Item Description:** A //felis catus// (domestic cat) of orange tabby variety. It has unusually long fur, standing at no less than 8 centimeters at its shortest point. Its fur is also anomalously pure in color, its teeth representative of a //smilodon populator// (sabertooth tiger). DNA tests show prominent sabertooth genes, and as such, it has impressive strength for its size. Most interestingly, however, is that when an x-ray was taken of this specimen, no bones or organs could be found. --It generally acts like a non-anomalous member of its species though, and has not displayed any hostile tendencies.-- Following its initial containment breach, this specimen has demonstrated the ability to teleport. It only does so when no one is looking, however, and seems aware of any attempts to view it through video feeds. Most frequently teleports to the cafeteria oven, which has often resulted in it catching fire.
**Date of Recovery:** 02-09-2022
**Location of Recovery:** Appeared in a locked containment cell at Site-322.
**Current Status:** --Contained within the cell it appeared in in Site-322--   --Unknown--   --Re-contained at Site-322 after reappearing in the Site cafeteria oven. Plans for transfer pending approval.--   Unknown; Keter class SCP classification request submitted and pending approval.
**Note:** //Following the latest containment breach, site staff have adopted the fitting nickname &#34;Vanishing Cinnamon Loaf&#34; for this specimen.//

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ THE FOLLOWING ITEM IS LEVEL 6 CLASSIFIED&#34; hide=&#34;- ACCESS GRANTED&#34;]]
**Item Description:** A completely non-anomalous stone. All information recorded electronically pertaining to it instantly becomes Level 6 classified. All attempts to lower the clearance level of information on this stone fail, usually through the information simply changing its clearance level yet again instantly after re-classification. Information electronically catalogued by anyone not working for the SCP Foundation is instantly deleted.

[[/collapsible]]

**Item Description:** A blender with no visible brand name, logo, or manufacturer&#39;s information visible.  When used, an unidentified female voice comments on the items being blended.  It is clearly audible over the sound of the device&#39;s operation, and generally seems cheerful, often commenting on the perceived deliciousness or health value of the items being blended.  If the item is used before 6:00 AM or after 10:00 PM, the voice is noticeably unpleasant and is often heard to complain about needing sleep.  Regardless of when the blender is used, the voice has not responded to anything said in the vicinity of the item.  Whether it is incapable of doing so or simply choosing not to is unclear.
**Date of Recovery:** 18 November 2022
**Location of Recovery:** Bought at an estate sale in San Diego, California
**Current Status:** Being tested.
**Note:** //This item came to Foundation attention after the purchaser posted on social media about a talking blender.  Investigation revealed that the original owner was unaware of the item&#39;s anomalous effect due to significant hearing loss.  Paperwork with the item indicated it was purchased from a store named Four Garys Appliances.  The address given was a restaurant which public records indicate has been in that location since 1956.  There does not seem to have ever been a store named Four Garys Appliances anywhere in the United States at any point in history.//

**Item Description:** Child&#39;s fashion doll, visually identical to popular brand [REDACTED].  At random intervals, the item will vocalize in a female voice.  The language is unknown, but listeners have agreed that its tone suggests mild interest.  Testing to identify the language is ongoing.
**Date of Recovery:** 20 November 2022
**Location of Recovery:** Toy store in Columbus, OH
**Current Status:** Being tested.

**Item Description:** One intangible 1976 American penny, &#34;face&#34; side up. Item is completely unaffected by all non-exotic matter except for fragments of the sidewalk it initially rested on.
**Date of Recovery:** 22/11/2022
**Location of Recovery:** A sidewalk in Logan, Utah, USA
**Current Status:** --Segment of sidewalk containing item removed and placed in storage at Site-73.-- Item currently embedded within a small horseshoe magnet at Site-73 after testing unintentionally revealed a response to electromagnetic forces. Research into how the item can be removed from the magnet without trapping it inside a more powerful magnet is ongoing.

**Item Description:** Small round lapel pin, bearing a white background and the words &#34;SAY NO TO DRUGS&#34; in black lettering.  Item displays antimemetic properties but is otherwise non-anomalous.
**Date of Recovery:** 22/11/2022
**Location of Recovery:** Lost and found box at [REDACTED] Elementary School, Greer, AL
**Current Status:** Low-value item storage, Site-19

**Item Description:** A homemade quilt with a top side measuring 3 by 1.5 meters, and a bottom side measuring 6 by 3 meters. Despite this spatial disparity, all edges perfectly align and any objects inserted directly through the quilt will emerge in the equivalent space on the opposite side.
**Date of Recovery:** 24/11/2022
**Location of Recovery:** An estate sale in Vergennes, Vermont, USA
**Current Status:** --Moved to Site-146 for testing of spatial subanomalies.-- During a fire accidentally induced by AO-█████, the quilt was ignited. According to witness testimony by nearby personnel attempting to save various objects from the blaze, upon two separate holes burnt in the quilt growing large enough to connect, the quilt, fire, and AO-█████ all immediately disappeared, saving an estimated ██ anomalies and █ personnel from destruction. The whereabouts of this anomaly or AO-█████ are unknown at this time.

+++ Anomalous Items 911 - 920

**Item Description:** A seemingly ordinary 24 centimeter diameter fish bowl containing a healthy blue //Betta splendens// (Siamese fighting fish) about 7 centimeters in length. This object&#39;s anomalous properties only become clear when a human makes physical contact with the item. In these cases, it&#39;s revealed that the fish bowl is made entirely of ice, and the water in the bowl is actually liquid glass. This impossibility is supported by thermal imaging, which indicates that the ice measures exactly 0 ℃, while the glass measures approximately 1600 ℃. While this environment should be inhospitable for the fish, it lives a normal, healthy life. Testing has confirmed that the state of the bowl and its contents only affect humans, as tests with other animals have shown that they can drink and/or live in the glass like water. Additionally, items placed in the glass are not affected by its temperature, even when a human is making contact with them. When the fish inside of the bowl was removed for testing, it was revealed to be an ordinary representative of its species.
**Date of Recovery:** 16/09/2022
**Location of Recovery:** Found during investigations of suspected methamphetamine production in an abandoned home in Austin, TX. When the individuals involved in the operation were questioned by Foundation personnel, it was discovered that they were aware of the anomalous properties, having previously used the glass to kill unsuspecting henchmen.
**Current Status:** Held in Site-73 animal containment. As of time of recording, the original specimen, as well as two paracheirodon axelrodi (cardinal tetras), are contained within the anomalous bowl. Staff taking care of the fish must wear heat resistant gloves to avoid being burned by splashes from the bowl, and must utilize a top-mounted fish feeder that extends above the bowl&#39;s surface to feed the fish.

**Item Description:** A damp, torn plush toy depicting a character from the multiplayer mystery game //Among Us// (2018). When squeezed by a child between the ages of 6 and 13 currently playing any sport or game with similarly-aged youths, the squeezer gains an awareness of all ongoing cheating, rule-breaking, and general loophole abuse in the activity. This persists until either the squeezer quits playing, moves more than 10 meters from the plushie, or begins crying.
**Date of Recovery:** 29/11/2022
**Location of Recovery:** Playground of █████████ Primary School, ███████████, Hertfordshire, UK
**Current Status:** Repaired and transferred to Site-06-3 for long-term testing and containment. Research into its potential for espionage in youth-centric populations is ongoing.

**Item Description:** An approximately 8 ton food truck of unidentifiable make, model, and year. Examinations reveal the truck is about 30 years old and in poor condition, but it bears a coat of paint that has been applied within the last year. This fire engine red paint job ia decorated with traced outline of the trademark ████████&#39;s double arches, in the exact same color as the copyrighted logo. Each of these four logos bears a crudely painted smiling face and the brand name [REDACTED]; one face has its tongue stuck out as though licking its lips, one is drooling, one is sniffing at the air, and one has a french fry in its mouth. If an individual attempting to abstain from fast food consumption sees one of these logos indirectly, such as from the corner of their eye or through a photograph, the logo will animate. The first logo will wink and lick its lips, the second will drool as though impatiently awaiting food, the third will take a deep breath and drool, and the fourth will eat the french fry in its mouth. Viewing any of these short animations in their entirety has a memetic effect, causing the viewer to subconsciously repeat the actions taken, and to crave fast food until they have consumed enough to claim that they&#39;re &#34;stuffed&#34;.
**Date of Recovery:** 29/10/2022
**Location of Recovery:** Havre De Grace, MD; memetic influence was discovered during court proceedings over the truck&#39;s legality, in which several individuals commentented on the ordeal. Foundation personnel were called in to administer amnestics and destroy all photographs of the vehicle before court could be properly adjourned.
**Current Status:** Anomalous properties undergoing investigation. Location and destruction of photos and videos of the truck are ongoing.

**Item Description:** A yellow Class III SCP Foundation Biohazardous Materials Handling hazmat suit. When worn by any individual not trained in handling biohazardous materials, the individual gains expert knowledge on biohazard handling[[footnote]] Especially Class III biohazard handling. [[/footnote]] and SCP Foundation Class III biohazard protocol. Individuals wearing the biosuit also see an increase in fine motor skills while the suit is on. Upon taking off the suit, the subject who was wearing it will lose all knowledge gained from the suit, as well as fine motor skills, until the suit is put back on.
No anomalous materials have been found to date within the suit itself.
**Date of Recovery:** 12/4/2022
**Location of Recovery:** SCP Foundation Biosuit Locker #2567, Biological Containment Site-66
**Current Status:** Kept in Biological Containment Site-66 for use with interns, trainees, and other personnel not knowledgeable in biohazard protocol or possessing weak fine motor skills to handle dangerous materials. When not in use, kept in Biosuit Locker #2567, which a padlock has now been added to for security purposes.

**Item Description:** Three (3) &#34;S&#39;more&#34; flavored Poptarts. Exactly 300 seconds after an instance sustains any significant physical or chemical change, such as consumption, fracturing, increase or decrease in temperature, crumbling or rotting, it will turn into nonanomalous ash and a new instance will appear in the closest available space. Unless an instance is on a flat horizontal surface when this occurs, its replacement will most likely appear in midair and fracture on its way to the ground, repeatedly triggering the cycle and causing increasing amounts of ash to accumulate until the instance is secured.
**Date of Recovery:** 06/12/2022
**Location of Recovery:** ███████ ████ █████, a homeless shelter in Bismarck, North Dakota, USA
**Current Status:** Stored in separate Size-I object storage lockers, each modified with a soft floor to prevent fall damage. These lockers are cleaned twice monthly of accumulated ash.

**Item Description:** One unbroken ingrown brown human hair, 2733 centimeters in length. The item was surgically extracted from a highly irregular miniature pocket dimension located in a pore on the shoulder of ███████ Suárez (25/11/1948-30/04/2006), then an infant in the maternity ward of ███ ██████ Hospital. Shortly following extraction, the pocket dimension underwent rapid dissolution and ceased existing.
**Date of Recovery:** 06/12/1948
**Location of Recovery:** ███ ██████ Hospital, Alhambra, California, USA
**Current Status:** Displayed in the main entrance hallway on Sublevel 1 of Bio-Research Station 71&#39;s Light Containment Wing.
**Note(s):** ███████ Suárez was briefly considered for a position in the newly-formed SCP Foundation Antimemetics Division and underwent preliminary interviews in the Fall of 1976, but was rejected in favor of other candidates. Suárez was not believed to possess any anomalous properties following the dissolution of his bodily pocket dimension, though his personal file was briefly reopened in 2006 following the yet unexplained strangling death of Suárez. Notably, intense investigation of his residence revealed human hairs matching at least 67 missing persons in various drains, vents, and food and medication containers. Following a lack of leads or testable hypotheses, Suárez&#39;s personal file was resealed on ██/██/200█.

**Item Description:** One 8 by 8 centimeter bug board holding a single Drosophila melanogaster[[footnote]] Common fruit fly [[/footnote]]. When studied to a yet undetermined extent by a human subject, they will lose all prior knowledge of the field of genetics. Subjects still recognize words, terms, and persons associated with genetics, but are unable to remember any of their traits directly relating to genetics as a whole. For example, one D-Class personnel with a high school education in biology remained familiar with Rosalind Franklin&#39;s occupation and fame, but became unable to identify any specific accomplishments or discoveries attributable to her. This loss of knowledge is unaffected by amnestic treatments, but affected knowledge can be relearnt by conventional means.

**Note(s):** A DNA analysis of a sample of the chewed gum revealed it to have originated from Ohio resident █████ ████████. A foundation raid of his residence (on 06/12/2012) revealed ties to the group of interest Gamers Against Weed, and a lengthy history of posts to a number of reddit sub-communities (such as r/atheist, r/atheistsdebatechristians, r/debateanatheist, etc.). ████████ was not present, and has not returned since. Agents found signs of a struggle inside. Blood was found splattered against the walls, from both ████████ and an unknown individual. Shards of wood not resembling the material of the rest of the house were also identified, and samples were collected for tests, which came back inconclusive. Neighbors had not seen anyone other than ████████ entering or exiting the house, though they did note a bright flash of light followed by crashing sounds originating from the ████████ residence on 06/08/2012, which they attributed to &#39;a computer error&#39;. █████ ████████ has been designated PoI-12███, and the unknown assailant has been designated PoI-12024.
**UPDATE (05/13/2018):** PoI-12███&#39;s remains have been located, in ██████, █████████. Harsh weather and the passage of time have made autopsy infeasible. Their remains have been incinerated, and PoI-12███ has been designated a null-priority target.
