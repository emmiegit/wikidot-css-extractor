&gt;  **Foreword:** The SCP Foundation has discovered a substantial number of items which are simply too useless to merit further attention. This document lists those items which have prompted some curiosity. It may be used as a resource should knowledge of these items become useful or necessary in the future.  
&gt; – Dr. █████ █████, Head of Research, Site-██
 
This is the fourth volume of the log. The [[[log-of-anomalous-items| first]]], [[[log-of-anomalous-items-vol-ii|second]]] and [[[log-of-anomalous-items-vol-iii|third]]] volumes have been archived.

Lists of [[[log-of-extranormal-events| Extranormal Events]]] and [[[log-of-unexplained-locations| Unexplained Locations]]] have also been compiled.

**Item Description:** A heavily-damaged analog stopwatch with a singular button that, when pressed, &#34;starts&#34; the clock feature despite it having already been started an unknown number of times. The minute and second hand are in the correct position for each time despite being singular objects, and any specific time or times currently being tracked by the clock can be observed simultaneously, though attempting to view all times at once leads to nearly the entire clock face being obscured. Disassembly and reassembly has no effect on the item&#39;s properties.
**Date of Recovery:** 11-03-21
**Location of Recovery:** Among several items left at a homeless shelter in Los Angeles, California.
**Current Status:** Button mechanism removed. Mechanism and remainder of item held in separate object storage lockers.

**Item Description:** A standardized blue army helmet, with the letters &#39;UN&#39; painted on both sides. Typically used by UN Infantry Units. When worn by a person, they can only be referred to as a &#39;Blue Helmet&#39; or &#39;Blue Helmet Unit&#39; when being spoken about verbally. This effect is applied to the wearer, and when not being worn, the object compels those in a direct line of sight to wear the object.
**Date of Recovery:** 06-01-1948
**Location of Recovery:** Sent to the Foundation via PO box from the UN HQ in NY. All officials, including Secretary-General António Guterres, denied having sent the object.
**Current Status:** In low-grade anomalous storage.
**Note:** //I think it&#39;s kind of funny, but Dr. Richter was not happy when he found that thing in a package on his deck the day we recovered it. He isn&#39;t fully convinced the UN is innocent in this situation, but he&#39;s not authorized to send out agents to investigate. Thank god, he can be such a stuck-up. -Researcher Reaas//
**Second Note:** Researcher Reaas is currently being reviewed to see if he is still capable of his position after an inquiry from an Anonymous foundation staff member. -Automated Message

**Item Description:** A physical copy of //Carnivores// for PC. Despite only having the files needed to run Carnivores, the game will open as its sequel, //Carnivores 2//. The game plays as normal with no other anomalous effects.
**Date of Recovery:** 8/5/2002
**Location of Recovery:** A thrift store in ███████, New Jersey
**Current Status:** In the Site-██ breakroom.

**Item Description:** An SCP document tape that when viewed makes the person viewing confused. The tape is showed below[[footnote]] The anomaly effect aren&#39;t to harmful and therefore the tape is allowed to be viewed. [[/footnote]]:

**Item Description:** A group of 3 levitating blue plastic beach balls. Each ball has the ability to produce sounds of various species in the Cetacea Order at random intervals. The sound produced by the balls originates from an unknown source. The sounds have a memetic effect on anyone who has heard it. They will refer to the balls as &#34;cute&#34; or &#34;adorable&#34;. All beach balls have a note titled &#34;Cetacean Orbs by ███████ ███████&#34;

+++ Anomalous Items 761 - 770  

**Item Description**: A Bosch &#39;Diamond Core&#39; electric drill. Objects being bored by it will spin at the same direction and speed of the drill bit as if they were stuck.

The longer the object is spun, the higher the chance of it being launched out of the drill bit.
**Date of Recovery**: 2021/12/11 (Two-thousand-twenty-one, Twelveth of November)
**Location of Recovery**: Site-78&#39;s technical workshop.
**Current Status**: Neutralized. See related test-log.


**Item Description:** Containment Chamber 17 in Wing A of Site-517. Item is completely mundane; however, there appears to be an ongoing rumor among site staff that it is anomalous. Furthermore, some personnel (including high-ranking senior staff) have expressed concern that the item will be capable of causing an XK-Class End-Of-The-World scenario in the near future. These rumors are not the result of any memetic effect, and repeated scans of the chamber have yielded nothing of note. Despite this, the item has been given an anomalous item designation for the time being.
**Date of Recovery:** 2003/03/03
**Location of Recovery:** Site-517.
**Current Status:** Still connected to Site-517. Item is not currently in use.

**Item Description:** A portrait of a young woman, with a painting style reminiscent of the 70’s. When a subject walks through the portrait, they will be transported exactly 15 years into the past, to a location of personal significance to them. Actions performed in the past follow the Novikov self-consistency principle; past events that subjects attempt to avert will happen anyways, often because of the attempted aversion.
**Date of Recovery:** 1992/09/12
**Location of Recovery:**  Abandoned storage locker in Chicago, Ohio. Signs of recent habitation were present, along with a note saying, “I miss you. I just want to be with you again.”

**Date of Recovery:** ██/12/2022
**Location of Recovery:** Warehouse belonging to an unknown and potentially anomalous marketing company. Object was connected to a laptop computer containing a copy of Adobe Photoshop, as well as a Bing Images tab containing images of Pratt.
**Current Status:** In storage. Object can be requisitioned for any Site break-room; this has yet to occur.

**Item Description:** Potted ficus plant, slightly larger than usual. Appears non-anomalous upon inspection, and testing has yet to reveal any anomalous property. However, the location it was found in has no record of the plant being acquired at any point in its history. Those present at the location claim the plant has &#34;always been there&#34;; however, available surveillance camera videos show the plant was acquired at some point between 5 and 6 years ago. Even those who have been working at the location since before this point have no recollection of a time when the plant was not present, and will mention the plant when describing their memories of the past.
**Date of Recovery:** 21-12-2021
**Location of Recovery:** Office building belonging to Sapling &amp; Imagery Data Systems, which was later discovered not to exist. Extensive searches of all available databases provided no results; use of publicly available search engines such as Google or Bing also provides no results.

**Item Description:** A small instructional booklet titled //Easy Jazz Chords for Beginners,// which claims to display guitar fingerings for jazz music easy for anyone to perform. Pages showing the title and publishing information are missing, apparently having been torn out by hand. Actually following the instructions requires movements that are either impossible for human anatomy or cannot be performed in three dimensions. Those reading the booklet and following the instructions are generally confident in their ability to play the chords described, regardless of their skill at playing the guitar or level of familiarity with the instrument. This does not grant the ability to perform the impossible movements.
