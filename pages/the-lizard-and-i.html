On a recent escape attempt from Foundation custody, D-085 attempted to hide in the research labs of Dr ██████. Dr ██████ was in the progress of exploring a new theory of containment for SCP-682: that, through genetic mutation, certain individuals emitted a scent which, whilst undetectable to humans, would pacify SCP-682. Upon breaking into the labs, D-085 triggered the research equipment&#39;s stimuli, indicating he was in possession of said scent.

Upon discovery, D-085 was apprehended by site security and Dr ██████, the latter of whom explained his theory to D-085. 

At this point, an unrelated anomalous phenomena occurred, resulting in dialogue and inner monologues being sung to the tune of popular musical numbers. The following is a recording from the incident:
[[=]]
**[To be sung to the tune of [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZyQwjVRT5c &#34;The Wizard and I&#34;, from the musical Wicked].]**

**[Dr ██████:]**
Oh, D-085,
Many years I have researched
For a subject like you to appear
Why, I predict the Lizard could make you his
First reason to cheer!
My dear, my dear
I&#39;ll take you now to the Lizard
To give this theory a chance
With a scent like yours, dear
There is a definish chance
If this works as it should
You&#39;ll be making good

**[D-085:]**
Did that really just happen?
Have I actually understood?
All these times I&#39;ve tried
To escape or hide
showed my talent, I could
Go and tame the Lizard
If I make good
So I&#39;ll make good

When I meet the Lizard
Once I show my worth
And then I meet the Lizard
See the acid bath&#39;s great, great girth
And with all his Lizard wisdom
He&#39;ll say why he killed the farmers 
Then we&#39;ll join forces and rise up 
The Foundation will face karma! Yes!
He&#39;ll say to me, &#34;Well, you&#39;re not that disgusting
So climb up on me and let&#39;s ride!&#34; 
And that&#39;s how we&#39;ll begin
The Lizard and I

Once I&#39;m with the Lizard
My whole life will change
Cause once you&#39;re with the Lizard
You&#39;ll cause so much pain!
No researcher can bully you
You won&#39;t be cast into the flames
The whole world has to fear you
When by the Lizard, you&#39;re acclaimed
No longer trapped by 
the O5 inside
Not blinking so that I don&#39;t die
When we are claw in hand
The Lizard and I

And one day, he&#39;ll say to me
&#34;Eighty-five, human motives are so ulterior
Shouldn&#39;t a race with such red insides
Have a matching exterior?
And since off-site to an absurd degree
Seem fixated on the sun, for me
Would it be alright by you
If I, kill them all but you?&#34;
&#34;Well they want to terminate me
So hey, why not?&#34; I&#39;ll reply
Oh, what a pair we&#39;ll be, The Lizard and I
Yes, what a pair we&#39;ll be, The Lizard and...

Unlimited
My future is unlimited 
And I&#39;ve just had a vision 
It was memetic I think, I know 
It sounds truly crazy 
And amnestics make me hazy
But I swear, today there&#39;ll be 
A containment breach across Earth 
That&#39;s all been caused by me! 

And I&#39;ll rampage with the Lizard
Feeling things I&#39;ve never felt
Curse Clef and Kondraki 
Our furious vengeance will be dealt! 
And even if you drop a nuclear bomb
He&#39;ll regrow all his limbs and won&#39;t die
Oh what a devious scheme
When people see us, they will scream
We&#39;ll be the best uncontained team
The Lizard and I

**Dr. ██████:** Come on D-085, stop singing into that microphone and move it closer to it!

**Personnel D-085:** His throat&#39;s messed up man, look at it! He tried to match my Broadway vocals- (Gasps and screams)

**SCP-682:** (Appearing to assault D-085&#39;s body) …those lyrics were… disgusting…

**Dr. ██████:** (Retreats from the room)
