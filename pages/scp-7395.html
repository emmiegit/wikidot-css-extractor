SCP-7395 is permanently affixed to Dr. Reese Embers and cannot be removed without significant risk. Dr. Embers is assigned to Site-73[[footnote]]Site-73 is a facility within a converted office building, designed for the containment and study of inert, Safe-class, or otherwise benign anomalous objects, including the analysis and storage of deceased specimens[[/footnote]]. His work is considered suitable given SCP-7395&#39;s nature. 

Dr. Embers must undergo regular psychological evaluations to assess any mental health changes potentially linked to SCP-7395. In cases where travel outside Site-73 is necessary, he will be escorted by Mobile Task Force Kappa-7 (&#34;The Cowboys&#34;) to ensure his safety and the containment of SCP-7395. In the event of any change in SCP-7395&#39;s anomalous properties, Dr. Embers is to be placed in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-73 for assessment and containment. All activations of SCP-7395&#39;s properties or significant behavioral changes in Dr. Embers must be immediately reported to the Director of Site-73 and the SCP-7395 research team. 

These procedures are subject to revision as new information about SCP-7395 is gathered, with a focus on maintaining the safety of Dr. Embers and the security of the Foundation.

++ **Description:**
-----
SCP-7395 is a collection of seven rubber bands, each shaped to resemble different objects and creatures, commonly known as &#34;Silly Bandz[[footnote]]Silly Bandz are rubber bands made of silicone rubber formed into shapes including animals, objects, numbers, and letters[[/footnote]].&#34; These bands are affixed to the right forearm of Dr. Reese Embers. The individual bands are described as follows:

* __Dragon:__ Multicolored with hues of red, orange, and yellow.

* __Phoenix:__ A vibrant yellow.

* __Wolf:__ White and exhibits luminescence in low light conditions (glow-in-the-dark).

* __Christmas Tree:__ A combination of red, green, and white.

* __Shark:__ Monochromatic blue.

* __Airplane:__ Solid black.

* __Drumset:__ Predominantly blue.

Dr. Embers found that the bands adhered to his skin and could not be removed. Attempts to cut, burn, or otherwise destroy SCP-7395 have proven futile, indicating its indestructible nature. 
(//See Addendum 7395.2//)

The primary anomalous property of SCP-7395 manifests when the wearer experiences a state of genuine fear or perceives imminent danger. In such instances, the wearer is instantaneously transported to a location subconsciously identified as their &#39;safe space&#39;. This location varies per individual and is influenced by their past experiences and psychological state.

Following the cessation of the perceived threat or fear, an entity designated as SCP-7395-1 materializes. SCP-7395-1 takes the form of an individual whom the wearer deeply trusts and feels comfortable with, providing reassurance and offering the choice to return to their original location or remain in the safe space. Should the wearer choose to stay, SCP-7395-1 will reappear twice at intervals of ten minutes to offer the same choice. If the wearer declines to return after these intervals, SCP-7395-2 is summoned. SCP-7395-2 manifests as a person whom the wearer deeply fears or feels uncomfortable around. This entity demands the wearer to leave the safe space, often resulting in the wearer agreeing to return to their original location due to a heightened state of fear.

In the case of Dr. Embers, SCP-7395&#39;s effects have been thoroughly documented and continue to be monitored under the guidelines established in the Special Containment Procedures.

++ **Addendum 7395.1: Discovery and Initial Investigation**
-----
++++ __Discovery:__

On 09/12/23, Dr. Reese Embers discovered SCP-7395 on his desk at Site-73. Accompanying the bands was a note, stating, &#34;To protect a kind soul.&#34; The handwriting on the note was later analyzed and found to bear a strong resemblance to that of Dr. Embers&#39; mother.

++++ __Initial Investigation:__

Given the resemblance of the handwriting to his mother&#39;s, Dr. Embers contacted her via text message, maintaining operational secrecy. The exchange was as follows:

[[span class=&#34;text&#34;]]Hey Mom, did you send me a set of Silly Bandz? They&#39;re pretty cool but kind of weird.[[/span]]
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;recv&#34;]]
[[span class=&#34;text&#34;]]Silly Bands? No, I haven&#39;t sent you anything like that, Reese. Are you sure they&#39;re from me?[[/span]]
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;sent&#34;]]
[[span class=&#34;text&#34;]]Weird. The note with them looked like your handwriting. Must be a prank from someone at work. Thanks anyway, love you![[/span]]
[[/div]]
[[div class=&#34;recv&#34;]]
[[span class=&#34;text&#34;]]Love you too, Reese. Stay safe and don&#39;t get into trouble with your new &#39;toys&#39;![[/span]]
[[/div]]
[[/div]]
[[/div]]

Following this exchange, no further leads on the origin of SCP-7395 were found.

&gt; //Date: 08/13/23//
&gt; 
&gt; So, today&#39;s been odd. Found these Silly Bandz on my desk with a note. Reminded me of those crazy school days – I used to trade these like a Wall Street broker! Tried them on for a laugh, but now they won&#39;t come off. It&#39;s like they&#39;re glued to my skin. I&#39;ve tried everything – scissors, fire (not my brightest idea), even asked Dr. Udavich to give it a go. Nothing. Zilch. Nada. They&#39;re stuck. Mom&#39;s handwriting on the note, but she says it&#39;s not from her. Maybe someone&#39;s pulling a prank? If so, hats off to them for commitment. Gotta admit, they do look kind of cool, in a weird way. But if they don&#39;t come off soon, I might start charging people for the circus show. &#39;Come see Dr. Embers and his unbreakable, unstretchable, inexplicable wristbands!&#39; I&#39;d make a fortune. For now, guess I&#39;ll just roll with it. Who knows, maybe they&#39;ll bring me good luck or something. Not like they&#39;re going anywhere.&#34;

++ **Addendum 7395.2: Experiment Logs** 
-----

//Note: All procedures were preformed with the safety of Dr. Embers being top priority. Dr. Embers was provided with all necessary PPE to conduct the following procedures.//

++++ **Experiment Log 1 - Indestructibility**

+++++ __TestObjective:__ 
To assess the indestructibility of SCP-7395.

+++++ __Procedure:__ 
SCP-7395 underwent a series of tests including: Mechanical cutting with industrial-grade tools. High-temperature exposure using a controlled flame exceeding 1500°C. An industrial grade high intensity laser.

+++++ __Results:__ 
SCP-7395 resisted all forms of mechanical and thermal stress. No signs of damage, deformation, or change in properties were observed.

+++++ __Conclusion:__ 
SCP-7395 is confirmed to be indestructible by conventional means, demonstrating extraordinary resilience to physical and thermal stress.

+++ **Experiment Log 2 - Removal Attempt**

+++++ __Objective:__ 
To explore safe methods for removing SCP-7395 from Dr. Embers&#39; arm.

+++++ __Procedure:__ 
A series of non-invasive removal attempts were conducted, including: Application of various chemical solvents and oils known to weaken adhesive substances. Utilization of ultrasonic vibration to disrupt potential molecular adhesion. Experimentation with extreme cold using liquid nitrogen to test for brittleness.

+++++ __Results:__ 
None of the methods succeeded in detaching SCP-7395. The bands remained firmly adhered to Dr. Embers&#39; skin without causing irritation or harm.

+++++ __Conclusion:__ 
SCP-7395 is immune to non-invasive removal techniques, maintaining a permanent bond with the wearer&#39;s skin.

+++ **Experiment Log 3 - Post-Incident 7395-A Teleportation Test**

(//See Addendum 7395.3//)

+++++ __Objective:__ 
To validate SCP-7395&#39;s teleportation ability to a &#39;safe space&#39; in response to high stress.

+++++ __Procedure:__ 
Dr. Embers was placed in a controlled environment simulating a high-stress scenario using: Virtual reality simulations of various high-threat environments. Psychologically tailored stress triggers based on Dr. Embers&#39; personal fears.

+++++ __Results:__ 
When stress levels peaked, Dr. Embers was instantaneously teleported to his designated &#39;safe space&#39;. The return was triggered by a decrease in stress levels and interaction with SCP-7395-1.

+++++ __Conclusion:__ 
SCP-7395&#39;s ability to teleport the wearer to a perceived safe space under extreme stress is confirmed. This function appears to be a protective response mechanism.

++ **Addendum 7395.3: Incident Report 7395-A**
-----
++++ __Incident Overview:__

On 09/19/23, during a containment breach at Site-19, Dr. Reese Embers experienced a direct activation of SCP-7395&#39;s anomalous properties. Dr. Embers was at Site-19 to discuss the transfer of SCP-████ remains to Site-73.

++++ __Events Leading to the Incident:__

While touring the facility and visiting various containment chambers, Dr. Embers was near [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-173|SCP-173&#39;s]]] containment chamber during the onset of a containment breach. The sounds and movements associated with SCP-173 triggered a panic response in Dr. Embers.

++++ __Activation of SCP-7395:__

In a state of intense fear, Dr. Embers was instantaneously transported to his designated &#39;safe space&#39;, as per SCP-7395&#39;s properties.

++++ __Containment Breach Resolution:__

The containment breach was eventually secured by MTF Nine-Tailed Fox. Dr. Embers was found at the same location he had disappeared from, appearing disoriented but physically unharmed.

++++ __Journal Entry by Dr. Embers:__

&gt; Date: 09/20/23
&gt; 
&gt; Talk about a day to remember. I was at Site-19, primarily for discussions about transferring some remains to Site-73. Took the opportunity to tour the facility – it&#39;s not every day you get to visit Site-19. The place is like the Louvre of anomalies. Then, everything went sideways. A containment breach. I was near 173&#39;s chamber when it started. The alarms, the shouting, it was chaos. But what really got me was the sound – that unmistakable scraping of stone on concrete. It&#39;s one thing to read about 173; it&#39;s another to hear it move. That sound... it triggered something primal in me. Pure, unfiltered fear. My heart was pounding, my hands were shaking, and then, in the blink of an eye, I wasn&#39;t there anymore. I was in my old backyard, the one place I always felt safe as a kid. But it wasn&#39;t just a trip down memory lane. Someone who looked and sounded just like my mom was there. She asked me if I wanted to go back. I couldn&#39;t. Not then. Each time she asked, I said no. It was too peaceful, too comforting compared to the chaos at Site-19. Then he appeared. My father. Or something that took his shape. Seeing him, hearing his voice – it brought back every bad memory, every moment of fear I had as a kid. I was petrified, and just like that, I found myself back at Site-19, heart racing, in the arms of Nine-Tailed Fox. It&#39;s a lot to take in. These bands on my arm, they&#39;re not just indestructible trinkets. They&#39;re a link to the past I&#39;ve tried to forget, a bridge to memories both good and bad. And now, they&#39;re my lifeline in moments of danger. A guardian angel, or maybe a reminder of what I&#39;ve been running from. Still figuring that out.&#34;

&gt; 
&gt; //Participants: Dr. Reese Embers, Dr. Helen Wilkins (Therapist)//
&gt; 
&gt; **[Begin Log]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wilkins:** &#34;Good afternoon, Dr. Embers. How are you feeling today?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Embers:** &#34;Hey, Dr. Wilkins. I&#39;ve been better, to be honest. The whole thing at Site-19 really shook me up.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wilkins:** &#34;Understandable. Do you want to talk about what happened?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Embers:** &#34;Yeah. You know, when I got teleported to my &#39;safe space&#39; – my old backyard – it was comforting at first. But then, he showed up. My dad. Or, well, something that looked like him.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wilkins:** &#34;How did that make you feel?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Embers:** &#34;Terrified. I haven’t seen him in years, not since he had passed away. And there he was, as if he has never died. It was like all the fear from my childhood just flooded back. I couldn’t bring myself to leave that place, not until he forced me to.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wilkins:** &#34;And since then, how have you been coping?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Embers:** &#34;That’s just it – I&#39;m not sure I am coping. I&#39;ve started seeing him, my father, when I’m working. Just out of the corner of my eye, you know? I hear his voice sometimes, too. It’s making it hard to focus, hard to sleep.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wilkins:** &#34;Hallucinations can be a common response to trauma. It&#39;s your mind trying to process what happened.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Embers:** &#34;It feels so real, though. And it&#39;s not just at night or when I&#39;m alone. It&#39;s happening in the middle of the day, even when I’m surrounded by people.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wilkins:** &#34;Have these experiences affected your work?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Embers:** &#34;Absolutely. I&#39;m second-guessing myself, jumping at shadows. It’s not like me. I used to be the guy who could laugh in the face of danger, you know? Now, I feel like I’m losing that part of myself.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wilkins:** &#34;Recovery takes time, Reese. It&#39;s okay to not be okay. We can work through this together. For now, let&#39;s focus on techniques to ground you when these moments happen.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Embers:** &#34;I’d appreciate that, Dr. Wilkins. I just want to feel like myself again, without this constant fear lurking over my shoulder.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wilkins:** &#34;We&#39;ll get there. Let&#39;s start by discussing some grounding techniques...&#34;

++ **Addendum 7395.5: Incident Report 7395-B and Associated Audio Log**
-----
++++ __Incident Overview:__

On 10/01/23, Dr. Reese Embers engaged in a high-risk behavior by ascending to the roof of Site-73 and standing on the edge, deliberately inducing fear to activate SCP-7395&#39;s teleportation ability.

++++ __Detailed Incident Description:__

Dr. Embers accessed the rooftop of Site-73, bypassing several security protocols. Surveillance footage shows him standing perilously close to the edge, visibly agitated and displaying signs of distress. This behavior was in direct violation of SCP-7395 containment protocols and posed a significant safety risk.

++++ __Activation of SCP-7395:__

In this heightened state of fear, Dr. Embers was instantaneously transported to his designated &#39;safe space&#39;.

++++ __Post-Incident Consequences:__

Upon return, Dr. Embers was immediately reprimanded for his actions. He was mandated to attend additional therapy sessions with Dr. Helen Wilkins and placed under closer observation.

++++ __Attached Audio Log from Dr. Embers&#39; experience within SCP-7395:__

&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Embers:** (Breathing heavily) &#34;Okay. This is it. Time to face this once and for all.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; (Noise of SCP-7395-1 manifesting, resembling Dr. Embers&#39; mother.)
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7395-1:** &#34;Reese, it’s over. You’re safe. Do you want to go back?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Embers:** &#34;No, not yet. I... I need to see him. I need to face him.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; (Ambient noise indicating the silent manifestation of SCP-7395-2, resembling Dr. Embers&#39; father.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Embers:** (Voice more assertive) &#34;I spent years under your shadow, Dad. You controlled everything – our family, me. Your anger, your disdain... it was like living under a constant storm cloud.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-7395-2:** (Silent, imposing presence.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Embers:** &#34;But I&#39;m not that scared kid anymore. Your abuse, your belittling – it won&#39;t define me. I refuse to be the person you tried to shape through fear and intimidation. I am more than your legacy of anger.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; (Several seconds of silence, Dr. Embers&#39; voice softens.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Embers:** &#34;I choose my path, my emotions. I choose to let go of this fear. You no longer have any power over me. It ends here.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; (SCP-7395-2 begins to fade away without response.)
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Embers:** (A moment of silence, then a soft, relieved exhale. No verbal response, but a sense of closure is evident.)
&gt; 
&gt; (After a short pause, the sound of wind indicates Dr. Embers transportation back to the roof.)

&gt; 
&gt; //Participants: Dr. Reese Embers, Dr. Helen Wilkins (Therapist)//
&gt; 
&gt; **[Begin Log]**
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wilkins:** &#34;Good afternoon, Reese. How are you since our last session?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Embers:** &#34;Hi, Dr. Wilkins. I&#39;m... actually doing okay. Better than okay, really. It&#39;s been a journey, but I feel like I&#39;ve turned a corner.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wilkins:** &#34;I&#39;m glad to hear that. Would you like to talk about what happened during your recent experience with 7395?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Embers:** &#34;Yes, I think I need to. I put myself in danger, went to the roof, and I guess... I wanted to force a confrontation. It was reckless, but I felt like I had no other choice.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wilkins:** &#34;And during that confrontation?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Embers:** &#34;I faced him – my father, or at least, what it had made him out to be. For the longest time, his shadow loomed over me, his voice, his anger... it controlled me. But there, in that moment, I realized something crucial. He doesn&#39;t define me. His &gt; darkness isn&#39;t mine to carry.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wilkins:** &#34;That sounds like a significant realization. How do you feel now?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Embers:** &#34;Liberated, in a way. It’s strange to say, but I’m grateful for these bands on my wrist. They brought me face-to-face with my deepest fear, and in doing so, they set me free. They&#39;re like a guardian angel, in a weird, rubbery form.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wilkins:** &#34;It&#39;s quite a transformation, Reese. To find strength and gratitude in the face of fear is commendable.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Embers:** &#34;Yeah, it&#39;s weird. I never would&#39;ve thought something so frightening could end up being... well, protective. But here we are. I know there&#39;s still a lot to work through, but for the first time in a long time, I&#39;m looking forward to the future.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wilkins:** &#34;That’s a positive outlook. Remember, it&#39;s okay to seek help and support as you continue this journey.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Embers:** &#34;I will, thanks. And thanks for everything, Dr. Wilkins. Couldn’t have gotten here without your help.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. Wilkins:** &#34;You&#39;re always welcome, Reese. Keep up the good work.&#34;
