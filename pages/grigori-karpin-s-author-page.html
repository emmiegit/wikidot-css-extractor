//A multiversal degradation in anomalous phenomena ravages the world of magic, leaving its fantastical hidden lands and communities to gradually die out; the Foundation, its allies and foes, are made painfully aware that something must change. Explore the Impasse and the nuanced relationship between the Foundation, the anomalous, and the nature of change itself. Examine the world at stake and decide, ultimately, how to bring it hope.//

__**No Return**__ is the canon that follows on the heels of SCP-6500: Inevitable, but you already knew that right?  This canon is concerned with consequences first and foremost; when we were writing SCP-6500 it became clear that whichever timeline the reader chose, the concept of the Foundation was going to be irrevocably changed.  Which is fitting, as Inevitable is a pretty stark //climate change// allegory.  We wanted to create a setting in which would foster further stories, leading off from either timeline.

* //**412 C.E.**// -- SCP-4612-A appears before a monk at Lindisfarne; the event is significant as the timing is suspiciously close to the initial beginnings of period colloquially called the Dark Ages.

* //**May 5, 1779**// -- William Henry Eckhart confirms to a fellow member of the Society of Yorkshire Thaumaturgy that he has found the Rite of Solomon (as seen in [[[SCP-3457]]]) and intends to use it to bind a god.  Eckhart and the rest of the Society intend to destroy whatever force is interfering in humanity’s technological progress.

Re: Proposal concerning SCP-6237

In respect to the cascading rising costs of containment and the failure of infiltrations of SCP-6237-B, the Department of Procurement and Liquidation proposes the following action.  SCP-6237-B is a publicly traded company; despite its anomalous aspects, it is as susceptible to economic strategies as are otherwise similar companies.  Therefore:

++++ Details of the Proposal:
* The Department of Procurement and Liquidation will orchestrate a multi-tiered hostile takeover of ERS LLC shareholders, utilizing numerous shell companies, until controlling more than 51% of the shares;
* Such action will allow the Department to control the Board of Directors and thus, the activities of SCP-6237-B.  

++++ Benefits:
* Containment can shift from the disinformation campaign and its extensive costs – both in resources and personnel hours – to the modification of SCP-6237-B’s activities, to better serve the Veil;
* With control of SCP-6237-B’s Board of Directors, the Foundation will have access to extensive ritual information and research which would benefit the containment efforts of unrelated anomalies connected to thaumaturgy and the occult.
