**Item #:** SCP-7727

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Dr. Roberts&#39; office has been relocated to containment chamber 34A-C, where he is to continue his work remotely. The chamber is not ventilated and is temperature controlled to 2° C. Dr. Roberts is not permitted to leave his containment chamber under any circumstances. No meals are to be supplied.

**Description:** SCP-7727 refers to an anomalous scent produced by Dr. Jackson Roberts. SCP-7727 possesses a low odor detection threshold and high concentration, making it extremely potent and overpowering. The scent has been compared to Cadaverine[[footnote]] (CH2)5(NH2)2.[[/footnote]] and Putrescine[[footnote]] (CH2)4(NH2)2.[[/footnote]] by Foundation biochemists. 

To date, Dr. Roberts is the only individual not affected by SCP-7727.

**Discovery:** SCP-7727 first came to Foundation attention following various Human Resources complaints regarding Dr. Roberts. At first thought to be a personal problem, Dr. Roberts was ordered to take steps to improve his hygiene by HR personnel. After 16 further complaints were filed within a span of 3 days, Dr. Roberts was forcibly taken from his office during work hours and thoroughly bathed by two D-Class personnel supplied with gas masks. 

Following the conclusion of this bath, Dr. Roberts still exuded SCP-7727 and was taken to Site-55&#39;s Intake Department for processing. While present, two personnel fainted from the smell and the remaining five refused to process Dr. Roberts until they were similarly supplied with gas masks. 

**Addendum 7727.1:** The following attached document is a recorded conversation between Dr. Roberts and Researcher Chun, an Intake Department member assisting in Dr. Robert&#39;s processing.

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
//Note: Chun had previously commanded Roberts to remove his clothing as part of the standard humanoid intake assessment procedure.//

= **&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;**

**Roberts:** This is so humiliating. 

**Chun:** It could be worse. 

**Roberts:** It can&#39;t be //that// bad, can it? I mean, come on. I shower just like everyone else! I put on deodorant //and// cologne!

**Chun:** Sit still a moment, I&#39;m trying to take your blood pressure.

**Roberts:** Sorry.

//[There is a ten-second silence.]//

**Chun:** Stupid sphygmomanometer. It&#39;s probably broken. I can&#39;t seem to get a read on your blood pressure. Hold on. Let me grab a pulse oximeter. 

//[There is a five-second silence.]//

**Roberts:** Is that one of those that goes on the finger?

**Chun:** Yup.

//[There is a five-second silence, followed by a beeping.]//

**Chun:** Huh. What are the odds of my sphygmomanometer and oximeter being broken at the same time?

//[Chun removes the oximeter from Roberts&#39; finger, but half of his index finger comes along with the oximeter. Roberts recoils.]//

**Roberts:** My finger! Aaaah!

**Chun:** Don&#39;t be such a baby. We can grow it back.

**Roberts:** You psychopath, you broke off my finger! What&#39;s the matter with you?!

**Chun:** Dr. Roberts, please calm down. We can&#39;t process you if you keep yelling. 

**Roberts:** Fine.

//[Chun reaches for his stethoscope.]//

**Chun:** One last try. Let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on with you.

//[There is an eight-second silence.]//

**Chun:** Nothing. 

**Roberts:** What do you mean nothing?

**Chun:** Exactly that. I got nothing. 

**Roberts:** Well... I feel fine. I guess nothing ain&#39;t so bad.

**Chun:** Except for the fact that you stink.

**Roberts:** Oh come on, it really can&#39;t be that bad if I can&#39;t even smell it!

= **&lt;END LOG&gt;**

//End-Note: Dr. Roberts continued to argue with Chun over the smell of SCP-7727 for approximately fifteen minutes before being escorted to his new containment chamber. On the way, Dr. Roberts stubbed his toe against a wall and complained about it coming unattached but was quickly stopped from complaining by guard personnel. Dr. Roberts&#39; next of kin were informed as per [[[family disclosure protocol]]] and direct containment of SCP-7727 began.//
