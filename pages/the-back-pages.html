//Are you interested in experiencing the dreams of another? Perhaps you&#39;re a writer who&#39;s misplaced his creativity, or wish to experience lucidity in an existence of surreality, unbound by law or physics. Perhaps you yearn for an escape, or are merely curious. Or maybe you&#39;re simply wealthy and yet, bored.//

//Whatever your reasons, if you find yourself interested by the idea of seeing a world of sleeping fantasies, there is a way to do so. First, you must sacrifice a hen under the full moon (the means of sacrifice are unimportant), then use its blood to paint out, in order, the alchemical symbols of gold, iron and silver. There are other steps, but they will be revealed to you.//

//Do not worry about such matters as payment, or of finding us. We will know you.//

If you&#39;re embittered, angry, or have otherwise had to remove someone from your life, it can be hard to move on.

[[size 1.1em]]**__PIRATES FOR SALE__**[[/size]]

&gt; The Foojztorial ship authorities frequently intercepts pirates, smugglers and other sea-ne&#39;er-do-wells -- which, due to a combination of the severity to which the Foojztorial courts hold trader-bothering, and Fot&#39;s strict opposition to maximal punishment, has resulted in prison over-crowding.
&gt; 
&gt; To solve this, the Grand Dungeon Authority of Foojztoria has convened to hold an &#34;all-pirates-must-go&#34; sale. To participate, simply send a letter to the Authority describing the pirate you would like to purchase, as well as your address and 25 seolirs (plus an additional 5 seolirs packaging and delivering fee) and the Distribution Council will do their best to ensure that the vagabond you recieve is as close to your specification as possible.

//If you want to garner a world-altering power, but don&#39;t know who or what to go to, it can be difficult. There are so many choices for subservient magical beings, each with their own associated legalities and obfuscated prices, that it&#39;s just impossible to know which is right for you.//

//That stops now! At djinncomparison, we compare hundreds of demons, spirits, elementals and non-corporeal services. We have a simple two-page form to automatically sort through for under a dozen of the best deals, specific to each customer; all online and on the go! Just take our brief financial questionnaire, and you&#39;ll soon be commanding the spirit ideal for you, for half the usual cost, in no time!//

&gt; I was losing fortunes paying holymen and conjurers to summon and bind creatures just right for the job I needed done, before I found out about djinncomparison. Now I command an army of statues, and I&#39;ve had everyone who overcharged me executed!
-- {{Dave, from Cornwall}}

&gt; Before djinncomparison, I&#39;d spent years poring over ancient tomes, trying to find suitable binding rituals for the Men of the Fire. But then I went online, and after 30 minutes on the under-net, I realized I could just call upon a sacrificial goat who&#39;d been ascribed servitudal powers of heaven. Thanks, djinncomparison!
