    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>+ SCP-7893
**Object class:** Apollyon. See &#34;Special containment procedures&#34; and &#34;Abilities&#34;.
**Threat level:** Green. Has shown no ill intent, and cooperated fully with tests.
**Special containment procedures:** Impossible to contain according to current data. Subject no-clips through containment cell walls on any attempt to contain.

**Description:** True form: Glitches in the air, does not resemble a body or humanoid figure, takes the form of a fog. Very weak.
Current form: Posessing a dead body of a child named Jack (See History)

**Abilities:** Suspected warping of [reality, space-time continum], ressistance to [amnestics, anti-memes, cognitohazards of all levels], no-clip abilities, dimension-hopping, teleporting, summonning of [SCP-7893-B instances, clones], increased jump height, superhuman speed, Suspected time-warp or &#34;save-states&#34;.

**History:** Posesses a dead body of a 14-year old named Jack. SCP-7893&#39;s testimony and tests done show that SCP-7893 did not kill Jack. Security camera footage and SCP-7893&#39;s testimony says that Jack was found dead by SCP-7893&#39;s true form in a alleyway in a city near Jack&#39;s place of residence, after that, Jack was now posessed by SCP-7893. Premortem, Jack was a orphan, living in [DATA EXPUNGED]&#39;s orphanage, located in the [DATA EXPUNGED] residence in [DATA EXPUNGED], [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-7893 attempted to mimic normal life, however other children from the orphanage saw anomalous activity, the children reported them to the orphanage staff, orphanage staff reported this to local law enforcement, etc. until the SCP foundation recived a report of said anomalous behavior. Anomalous behaviour was observed in the form of distorted voice, glitchy apperance, doing dangerous acts without harm after an event that should have injured Jack (Falls, Knife accidents, Burns), and fidgeting with a glitchy knife, identified as SCP-7893-B. SCP-7893, on discovery by SCP Foundation Personell, was found in the orphanage, calmly. 

**Containment breaches:** SCP-7893 has breached containment multiple times. The first time was ~2 days after SCP-7893 was found and detained. During the containment breach, SCP-7893 stole a recipe book from the kitchens, temporarily did all the work using it&#39;s abilities, putting the recipe book back afterwards. Second time was when beforehand SCP-096 had breached containment. However records of this second breach are unknown, as SCP-7893 wiped all records.

Recollections of the initial encounter at [DATA EXPUNGED]&#39;s orpahange are not classified and can be acessed for any reason.

[[code]]
The door of Jack&#39;s room in the orphanage is broken down.
Squad member #1: PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR!
All Squad members raised their assault rifles, pointing them at SCP-7893.
SCP-7893: Ok ok, wait, lets calm down here...
SCP-7893 does not seem worried, but puts it&#39;s hands up in the air anyways.
Squad member #2: Good. Come with us...
SCP-7893: What are your orders?
Squad member #1: We said come with us!
SCP-7893 sighs, looking annoyed.
SCP-7893: Can&#39;t i at least know if i should cooperate run or fight?
Squad member #3 sighs too.
Squad member #3: Just... Ok. We have orders to detain you and bring
-- you to the foundation, and not to use our weapons, only to use them for intimidation.
SCP-7893: Eh, ok, ill come.
SCP-7893 jumped out of the window, to the shock of the squad members, and 
-- walked peacefully towards the concealed SUV that they arrived in.
[[/code]] 

**Personality:** SCP-7893 is described as a: 
&gt; Friendly, helpful, cooperative apollyon-level anomaly.
By foundation staff. When asked about it&#39;s own personality, SCP-7893 responded with:
&gt; I mean, how can i describe myself? You would probably assume im biasing for myself anyways, thats your job to deduce my traits.
