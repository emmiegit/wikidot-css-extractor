**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5541 is considered uncontainable at this time. There are no current theories or models that can be used as sufficient evidence to support acceptable proposals for novel containment measures of SCP-5541. It is unknown whether or not SCP-5541 needs to be contained at all, however, observations and extensive analysis of data obtained from testing with [[[SCP-2003]]][[footnote]]Enabled for use within the Temporal Anomalies Department since 2348 AD for limited testing use cases in which Mk. V Xyank-Anastasakos Constant Temporal Sinks ([[[welcome-to-delta-t|XACTS]]]) and strategically placed [[[scp-3001|Lang-Scranton Spatial Stabilizers]]] enable increased power output (up to 1*10^^8^^ kW), more accurate fine tuning of end location, and an additional, heretofore unknown set of metastable tachyon flux conditions. Research into the potential applications is ongoing.[[/footnote]] suggest that prevention and/or the containment of affected timelines is necessary for the continued existence of the Foundation and the current definition of consensus reality for the remainder of this iteration of the universe.

--SCP-5541-1 does not require containment measures at this time.-- 

UPDATE 10.17.2676 - A trusted member of Overwatch has been given select details about the anomaly and the group responsible for SCP-5541-1&#39;s successful inception across all relevant timelines, as well as potential solutions. Members of Tactical Operations Command for the Temporal Anomalies Department are to utilize SCP-2003 for daily inspections of variant timelines and report any atypical findings immediately.

UPDATE 10.22.2676 - Attempts to provide our RCT-Δt O5 informant with preliminary data regarding SCP-5541-1 have proven ineffective. Checking the causal stream shows detrimental actions taken by the informant upon reception of this document that were unaccounted for. These actions may have had a direct relationship with the manifestation of SCP-5541. 

Days without an atypical finding: {{18437}} //(as of 04.22.2726)//

Atypical findings since initial manifestation: {{00000}} //(as of 04.22.2726)//

**Description:** SCP-5541 is the designation for a temporally certain outcome expressed throughout all future timelines that will be observed by the Foundation Temporal Anomalies Department, beginning at the end of the current millennium, always between the years of 2995 and 3003 AD. This phenomenon is first observed at some arbitrary point after the events of [[[scp-4888|Operation HIGHLANDER]]],[[footnote]]Controversial mission entailing a preemptive strike on GOI-Σ &#34;The Sunrise Collective&#34;—the party that will ultimately result in the inception of SCP-5541.[[/footnote]] which has been or will be the result of RCT-Δt&#39;s actions taken upon discovery of SCP-5541. Therefore, it is believed that the anomaly manifested via a closed-loop &#34;bootstrap&#34; temporal paradox.[[footnote]] That is to say, the timeline of events involving the manifestation of this outcome lacks a true beginning or end, as said events occur in an endless causal loop of mutual action and reaction (see Figure 3).[[/footnote]] View the below materials for more information on temporal field theory and its relevance to SCP-5541.

RCT-Δt experimentation attempting to prevent the conception of the paradox does not appear to be effective. So far, over 150 attempts of varying methodology have been initiated by RCT-Δt traveling back to prevent RCT-Δt from traveling back and providing this document to a trusted member of Overwatch. If this document still exists in the repository before the date of its creation, then all tests have been unsuccessful.

It is postulated that SCP-5541 likely cannot be prevented nor delayed without use of extreme measures such as anomalous tools or retrocausal weapons, which would be used to terminate or otherwise displace one or more parties involved in the creation of the paradox. However, it is impossible to confirm whether this would have any effect on the outcome at all without doing so, nor whether it would result in the desired outcome versus an any number of potential negative impacts, such as an ontological breakdown of reality or unwanted alteration of future timelines.[[footnote]] Most notably, one or more parties involved have an intrinsic relationship with the career progression of the [[the-assassination-of-xyank|late]]] Thaddeus Xyank, that, if disturbed sufficiently, could result in the nonexistence of RCT-Δt and/or a subsequent &#34;grandfather&#34; temporal paradox effect.[[/footnote]]

SCP-5541 is described as a global paradigm shift that cannot be altered in any currently known way, affecting all timelines tangent to our own, starting at a single 4th-dimensional point that encompasses all frames of reality that occur during the causal loop—regardless of other initial conditions and outcomes leading up until the point of Emergence.[[footnote]]Timelines that end prematurely due to other causes or experience phenomena that render humans inert/incapable of carrying out SCP-5541 are excluded from this criteria. [[/footnote]] This makes SCP-5541 the only known event in an observed future timeline to do so other than (presumably) the heat death of the current iteration of the universe.[[footnote]]This outcome has not been observed considering the amount of power currently needed to send one person that distance with SCP-2003 is greater than or equal to the total energy contained within the entire universe itself.[[/footnote]] SCP-5541&#39;s nature and effect on sentient life is not entirely the same in all affected timelines, however, analysis indicates that at least some axioms can be considered true or likely true:

* All timelines observed by members of the Temporal Anomalies Department that fit the criteria will ultimately succumb to SCP-5541 around the end of the third millennium
* Whether or not SCP-5541&#39;s emergence is a consequence of the Heisenberg cut initiated by Foundation personnel observing these futures, the result of the causal loop itself, a multidimensional homogenous wave function collapse synchronization,[[footnote]]Though synchrony with divergent timelines is rare and naturally decreases in possibility over time, major external forces of extradimensional origin could theoretically manifest a large-scale causal stream &#34;resonance&#34; event vis-à-vis the simultaneous and sudden influence on/interaction between large portions of the multiverse, resulting in greatly limited and/or interlinked probabilistic outcomes.[[/footnote]] or any combination of these remains unknown and is unlikely to be determined
* SCP-5541 will always involve the complete destruction of Foundation infrastructure, leading to the release of thousands of various anomalous entities and items, followed by the prosecution of Foundation staff. To note, many previously considered highly aggressive and dangerous, Keter/Apollyon-level entities, objects, concepts, locations and phenomena simply do not activate or become docile once containment is broken while SCP-5541 is in effect
* A [[[broken-masquerade-hub|Broken Masquerade]]] event will occur and public opinion of Foundation efforts and employees will be quickly perceived in an overtly negative light 
* A gestalt Group of Interest will form from several extant groups, all of which are confirmed dissidents of Foundation operations, named &#34;The Allied Occult Initiative&#34;, designated SCP-5541-1/GOI-Ω, which will assume control over the entire planet
* Mass thought and awareness of the public will shift, leading to a total unification of ideology and a restructuring of consensus reality, as it is defined by SCP-5541-1. Most irrational and undeserved fears, hatreds, thought complexes, behaviors, beliefs, and prejudices will effectively cease 
* Foundation testing logs and staff rosters will become public knowledge, operatives will be systematically hunted down and imprisoned or terminated via a variety of means by the public and encouraged by SCP-5541-1
* SCP-5541-1 will also trigger similar events for select groups of interest which always include but are not limited to The Fifth Church, Sarkism, and Marshall, Carter &amp; Dark
* A period of nonviolence and spiritual/intellectual enlightenment will occur, lasting anywhere from 5-30 years
* Phenomena on Earth will become increasingly anomalous,[[footnote]]See below for more information.[[/footnote]] during which time public perception of said phenomena will remain mostly the same—A quality deemed &#34;Nonchalance&#34; by members of the Temporal Intelligence Community
* At some point before 3108 AD, the Earth (And all others in timelines tangent from ours during and after the causal loop) will experience an emergent QK-Class &#34;Quantum Degeneracy&#34; End-of-World Scenario, designated SCP-5541-Ω, and all life on the planet will cease to exist

As briefly touched upon above, SCP-5541&#39;s exact emergence point is unclear in most cases. It is typically marked by the loss of Foundation sites, important members of the Administration, and/or many personnel, ultimately leading to larger-scale failures.

In majority of instances, the destruction of one or more vital Foundation sites can be cited as the primary cause of systemic collapse of all organization operations. In some cases (~30%), this event can be traced to a Keter-level containment breach. In less cases (&lt;10%), the cause is associated with personnel sabotage, both as deliberate attempts of insurgents or as revenge from disillusioned personnel acting as lone assailants. Nearly 60% of all cases were due to administrative/infrastructural collapse, or budgetary/containment constraints. ~1% of cases involve the spontaneous detonation of one or more on-site nuclear warheads and/or related &#34;black swan&#34; preventative measures. 

Attempts to divert or otherwise prevent Foundation collapse in timelines impacted by SCP-5541 have been unsuccessful in all cases. Individual events can be mitigated, but without proper foresight associated with backwards travel, it is impossible to predict when the next may occur. It appears that in most of these timelines, the Foundation had been at risk of a catastrophic failure for some time leading up to the event itself. Individual agents of Tactical Operations Command have attempted to &#34;prime&#34; a specific timeline by traveling in the time leading up to the window during which SCP-5541 will emerge, but in every instance events occur that are beyond the scope of reach or agents find themselves otherwise hampered by one or more individuals acting against the interests of the agents and the Foundation as a whole.[[footnote]]To note, there have been zero reported interactions with future members of the Temporal Anomalies Department throughout exploratory efforts. Personnel in observed timelines generally express confusion at the presence of TAC agents from the past, possibly suggesting future agents are still traveling forward to deal with threats, isolating themselves from past members to safeguard against annihilation via self-interaction, and/or are aware of some information regarding SCP-5541 that, for an unknown reason, prohibits them from informing current RCT-Δt members of their status/whereabouts. Investigations into future members of the Temporal Anomalies Department are being considered, however, logistical concerns and inherent trust-related risks are major obstacles to these operations.[[/footnote]]

It is also to note that in most timelines, by the end of the third millennium, containment efforts have increased in cost, size, and logistical complexity such that it becomes nearly impossible to keep track of all facets related to sustaining uniform operations. In addition, average employee morale is at an all-time low in almost every instance.

&gt; 
&gt; 14:22 - SCP-2317 is seen standing from its structure within Universe-Kappa-Erikesh.
&gt;  
&gt; 14:30 - Deployed Foundation forces arrive at Area-179, official religious figures brought on-site to perform various rites and blessings. O5 Council taken off-world. Bystanders are seen crying and calling loved ones.
&gt; 
&gt; 14:35 - SCP-2317 breaks through the door to Universe-Kappa-Erikesh, widening the portal to near-incomprehensible size. Foundation forces prove ineffective.
&gt; 
&gt; 14:42 - SCP-2317 ignores all parties and leaves containment area, walking westward.
&gt; 
&gt; 15:35 - SCP-2317 travels several thousand kilometers to the country shoreline, taking pains to avoid crushing horrified pedestrians.
&gt; 
&gt; 16:25 - SCP-2317 arrives at a local beach and sits, watching the sun until it goes down several hours later (19:43).
&gt; 
&gt; 16:50 - Children are seen playing in the sand on and around SCP-2317&#39;s feet until some time later. 
&gt; 
&gt; 20:04 - SCP-2317 falls asleep on the beach, a smile seen on its face. Small animals such as squirrels and stray dogs are seen gathering around the entity, sleeping and/or nesting beside SCP-2317&#39;s form. Birds land on the creature&#39;s nose as it breathes, remaining mostly in this position for at least several days. Foundation containment efficiency plummets from the subsequent Broken Masquerade Event, leading to systemic collapse of all operations within 48 hours, due in part to an extremely successful doxxing campaign launched by members of the popular online variety content board &#34;4chan&#34;.

SCP-5541-Ω does not manifest in the same way every time, often it manifests as a secondary event or unintended result of something unrelated. Unfortunately, it is difficult to garner much detail about the exact nature of the event due to the inherent danger involved in doing so. 

Only two agents have been able to witness part of an in-progress SCP-5541-Ω event and escape unharmed—Agent Dacia (mentioned above) and an agent whose abstract conceptual space for which the Temporal Anomalies Department would have assigned or referred to for a name was lost in the event. All involved remember the agent, who was previously associated with Agent ID {{[the type or namespace reference &#34;null&#34; is not found]}}, yet no one can recall the person&#39;s name nor a substitute label which could be used in reference to identity. This agent recalled that the event was triggered by an exceptionally large game[[footnote]] Estimated to have over 100M players.[[/footnote]] of hide-and-seek.

&gt;&gt; Note: This document was recovered from a routine observation of SCP-5541. It was selected for inclusion on the basis that it is notable for erroneously describing SCP-5541-Ω phenomena as anomalous. Footnotes have been provided as clarifying remarks from the Temporal Anomalies Department and thus were not present at time of recovery. 
&gt; 
&gt; [[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5541/AOI.png]]
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; **Case File #:** 90G-1IPN-Y190
&gt; 
&gt; **Exhortation Class:** Hemlock[[footnote]] The &#34;Hemlock&#34; designation encompasses the range of anomalous activity that, by their own nature, are impossible to mitigate due to their relationship with consensus reality, yet pose no current threat to long-term normalcy, as defined by SCP-5541-1.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Hazard Level:** LOW
&gt; 
&gt; **Priority:** LOW
&gt; 
&gt; **Risk Mitigation Factors:** N/A
&gt; 
&gt; **Specifications:** Case File #90G-1IPN-Y190 is the collective designation for a set of --five-- six aberrant configurations of gravitational syzygy,[[footnote]] A specific or noteworthy alignment of three or more celestial bodies.[[/footnote]] referred to as 90G-1IPN-Y190-A through 90G-1IPN-Y190---E-- F, and their relationship with Jupiter. Aberrant phenomena has not been associated with these alignment types prior to 3000 AD.
&gt; 
&gt; Instances are found to occur when Jupiter obscures the view of another planet from all observers in the solar system. Analysis has confirmed this effect extends to other aberrant interplanetary designations like [[[scp-179|Case File #90M-NP17-PL19]]] and [[[scp-2399|Case File #14X-RE02-CT21]]]. All portions of the observable universe completely masked by Jupiter effectively cease to exist for as long as they are unobserved. Despite this, other portions of unobscured space function without indication of change, implying that reality does not exist on the far side of the planet. This effect has been confirmed through the use of Lacunar-Thaumaturgic Ranged Image Processing (L-TRIP)[[footnote]] Likely a successor to programs developed by the Foundation—specifically the Terrestrial Earth-Like Low-orbit Universal Sweep ([[[billiths-proposal|TELLUS]]]) program and project [[[scp-2498|RAINBOW ASTRA]]].[[/footnote]] systems which were utilized to grant temporary clairvoyance and help anticipate an increasing number of aberrant artifacts and phenomena. The unexplained effect of each configuration is heavily dependent on which body is obscured.
&gt; 
&gt; **Configuration List:**
&gt; 
&gt; ||~ Configuration #||~ Details ||~ Effect ||~ Rate/ETA ||
&gt; || #90G-1IPN-Y190-A || Jupiter occults Saturn || All biological growth and decomposition in the solar system ceases for duration of event. Radioactive isotopes do not decay. Humans unable to experience personal growth (emotional, spiritual, or physical). Global AEP rate[[footnote]] Artifact-Event-Phenomena Rate is used to determine the frequency of aberrant activity.[[/footnote]] decreases to ~0.0% || Now every 20-30 years ||
&gt; || #90G-1IPN-Y190-B || The moon/Venus/Mars occults Jupiter || All technological advancements of greater complexity than simple mechanisms like pulleys and levers cease function until event passes. Humans report sporadic cases of epistaxis and loss of consciousness. Boundary reality found to drop sharply for duration of event, leading to unintended aberrant effects || Every ~32 years ||
&gt; || #90G-1IPN-Y190-C || Jupiter occults Neptune || Global intelligence decreases dramatically for duration of alignment. General fatigue is often reported. Sentient beings cannot dream during this period || Unknown. Experienced 04/30/2998, configuration had not occurred since 9/19/1702 ||
&gt; || #90G-1IPN-Y190-D || Jupiter occults Uranus || Earth&#39;s oceans rapidly change to a mix of water, water-ice, methane and ammonia. Atmospheric conditions change to primarily hydrogen and helium. No adverse health reactions are detected. A faint ring is visible in the sky for duration of event, after which everything returns to its previous state || Every 300-400 years || 
&gt; || #90G-1IPN-Y190-E || Jupiter occults Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune simultaneously || Location of previously unconfirmed but hypothesized trans-neptunian planet reveals itself in spectacular fashion, designated #90G-1IPN-Y190-IX. Observation shows planet is occupied by a single, enormous, omnipotent entity || Does not occur naturally, happened once due to sporadic aberration pocket on 10/10/3001 ||
&gt; || #90G-1IPN-Y190-F || Jupiter occults #90G-1IPN-Y190-IX || Reality on far side of Jupiter stops existing while unobserved by omnipotent entity || Will activate sometime around 02/3012 ||

**Addendum 5541-Aion:** Additional Materials
 
[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop
| show= ◆ RCT-Δt&#39;s Proposal
| hide=-confirmed
| nohide=1
]]


&gt; //In light of information gained from extensive observations of SCP-5541 and its related effects, as well as various archive files already recorded or to be recorded by the Foundation regarding anomalous phenomena and statistical trends extrapolated by said information, the Temporal Anomalies Department has decided to submit for review a proposal for SCP-001. Submitted Document 001-Δt can be found below, which is currently under review by the O5 Council, the Ethics Committee, and the Temporal Intelligence Community.//
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Item #:** SCP-001 (Pending Assignment)
&gt; 
&gt; **Object Class:** Aisna-Boltzmann[[footnote]]A hybrid classification of two already established object classes, see //[[[esoteric-classes-complete-list|A Comprehensive List of Esoteric Classes]]]// for more information.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-001 is to be limited in scope to the best of the ability of the Foundation, but must not be completely contained nor abandoned at any time. This is to continue until such actions become impossible or are no longer necessary. It is believed that SCP-001&#39;s effects possess a certain &#34;acceptable&#34; range so as to ensure Foundation operations remain manageable and secure facilities self-sustainable for an indeterminate amount of time. Adhering to this range while undergoing a complete restructuring of protocol—one prioritizing rehabilitation, low-profile relocation and reintegration services—is presumed to be the most optimal means of preserving consensus reality and the lives of nearly every living being in the entire universe, across all universes and timelines that are impacted by SCP-001 itself. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Description:** SCP-001 is the designation for an anachronistic metaphysical quality that permeates all systems of complex structures that possess sentience, can be defined as &#34;human&#34;, and can otherwise receive, store, and transmit high-order information. SCP-001 is believed to manifest as the outcome of a probabilistic scenario initiated when the Heisenberg cut of a particular 3rd-dimensional frame within a 4th-dimensional octahedral reality is subject to wave function collapse. 
&gt; 
&gt; When probable outcomes collapse via observation, there is an unknown likelihood[[footnote]]Due to the scope of the effect and being unable to preclude the location of all physical spaces being unobserved simultaneously without observing said spaces.[[/footnote]] that SCP-001 will occur. When this happens, SCP-001 will randomly manifest anomalous phenomena at any synchronous point on the 3D frame that is also experiencing wave function collapse. This effect does not appear to have a limited range outside of the field of view and the ability to observe at a distance, so long as the space is being observed in some way in said frame and was not being observed the previous. In addition, the process  or sensory function in which the observation occurs does not appear to matter, although vision remains the most effective means of doing so that humans possess.
&gt; 
&gt; The intensity, frequency, and density of SCP-001&#39;s effect increases over each quantum of time elapsed, by a quantity determined via the previous density of the effect and other factors such as the broad awareness of this aspect of reality. When human entities gain knowledge of the anomalous, increase their population density, and/or unify their thought processes, the rate at which anomalous phenomena is generated increases, as well as the radius of the same effect impacting a spherical area surrounding the organism&#39;s brain.[[footnote]]This serves as a possible explanation for novel anomalous activity manifesting within Foundation Secure Facilities such as but not limited to [https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/collab:scp-site-19 Site-19] and [[[scp-1730|Site-13]]].[[/footnote]] Therefore, it is possible for this system to reach a &#34;cascade&#34; point, wherein a positive feedback loop of anomalous activity leads to the collapse of quantum systems due to insufficient universal resources. This appears to imply that what one might call &#34;anomalous&#34; is as real as reality itself, and is perhaps associated with some unknown form of higher-order mathematics and/or sciences that may explain all of anomalous activity as a whole. The inverse of this appears to also be true; when there are less observers in a space, the area being observed becomes less real by a faint, imperceptible, but entirely measurable change in Humes. As such, SCP-001 appears to suggest that the entirety of &#34;baseline&#34; reality is just as anomalous as everything that the Foundation secures, contains, and protects. 
&gt;  
&gt; It is speculated that Hume loss of unobserved space is correlated with a limited amount of &#34;processing power&#34; within the universe, and that SCP-001, and/or humanity itself, carries a built-in limiting/boosting mechanism to help regulate the Hume field of the surrounding reality. This is further corroborated by reports within spaces in which the Hume field logarithmically approaches zero, where human minds have been seen to [[[scp-3545|individually generate their own localized reality]]]. Likewise, there seems to be some inherent property of reality itself that is necessary to exist that cannot exist while unobserved completely, once a specific density of &#34;anomalous&#34; phenomena is reached.
&gt; 
&gt; **Conclusion:** The observer effect within the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, SCP-001, appears to be at least partially responsible for the generation of large portions of our current universe, utilizing or being generated by humanoid life-forms. Thus the phenomenon is both responsible for the generation of anomalous activity/baseline reality and cannot be contained fully, nor should it remain uncontained. Due to its relationship with the very objects the Foundation has spent eons studying and the Foundation&#39;s [[[scp-4002|strained relationship]]] with various groups considered &#34;different&#34; than humanity, such as [[[scp-1000|The Children of the Night]]], RCT-Δt urges the Council to immediately reclassify all phenomena as explained through the nature of consensus reality and begin rehabilitation/reintroduction programs for all sentient creatures in containment that are capable of doing so. This may be the only recourse we have to avoid the fate of our future selves. We will lose the war—but we believe things can still change so that it never happens in the first place. 
&gt; 
&gt; ------
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //Note: It should be known that, as of May 23rd, 2858, no records of a &#34;Temporal Anomalies Department&#34; exist in the Foundation record other than this document, which was found sealed with a metastable tachyonic displacement mechanism of unidentifiable origin. The documentation is dated nearly 100 years ago and was flagged by an automated consistency check where it remains until further notice. Interestingly, a slot for a [[[SCP-1968]]] was also flagged for inconsistency at the same time, as the checker had not detected an empty slot in that location in the previous scans. Despite this, scan results revealed little about what had been in the slot, only that it had matched the server and was not empty the previous week. In addition, &#34;The Allied Occult Initiative&#34; is not a yet-to-be founded GOI but the name of the predecessor to the Global Occult Coalition; please check official Foundation historical records if you have any doubts.//
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; //The recovered tachyonic device found associated with this file was designed to maintain a version of the document in a temporally-isolated substrate using a novel system to achieve temporospacial non-locality. Several suspected employees have been detained, but none recall any such device and have been cleared of wrongdoing. Likewise, O5-7 denies any recollection of the events described above and enhanced interrogation of various parties reveal no known entity by the name of Thaddeus Xyank. Investigation into the anomalous properties described above have not yielded conclusive results. Research, containment, and other core tenets of the Foundation, as it is described by the O5 Council, are to continue indefinitely.//
