**Item #:** SCP-7146
 
**Object Class:** Safe
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7146 must be contained .5 kilometers away from electronics of extreme importance. SCP-7146 requires no other special containment procedures. 
 
**Description:** SCP-7146 is a wireless computer that talks through console-like software. It is made of an extremely durable material. It exhibits the ability to control electronics around it. It also has extremely human-like emotions and communication skills. It is currently unknown when SCP-7146 was created.
 
     As of recently, this SCP-7146 appears to have entered a depressed and silent state. This is likely due to the loss of the class-D who was mainly used for testing on this item. It appears that the class-D had a friendship with SCP-7146 before the class-D&#39;s death. After this, SCP-7146 has taken to controlling and causing errors to various electronics around its containment.
 
 
 
**Addendum:** The following is an archive of the last day that the class-D was able to communicate with SCP-7146

- Hey, my little buddy
 
&gt; &#34;Hello, my fleshy companion!&#34;
 
- Let&#39;s not use nicknames that make me sound like some alien
 
&gt; &#34;Would you prefer I call you &#34;Disposable Prisoner&#34;?&#34;
 
- You&#39;re the one who has people testing on you y&#39;know AND I&#39;m getting out of this stupid place in a few days, just after some other tests on some others
 
&gt; &#34;Well, why did you join this “stupid place” then?&#34;
 
- Okay so, I&#39;m pretty poor and this place promised me some good money
 
&gt; &#34;Money? Just for talking?&#34;
 
- Oh right, I&#39;m also supposed to ask you some questions so the foundation can “figure you out more” but that really isn&#39;t how I roll. 
 
&gt; &#34;Hmm, that must be why all the others were speaking so robotically and constantly asking me questions.&#34;
 
- All the other “D-Class” seem pretty rude, and it wouldn&#39;t surprise me they would talk to you like that
 
&gt; &#34;You’re right, I feel like you’re the only one who treats me like I’m sentient.&#34;
 
- Anyways once I get out of here, I&#39;m hoping to have enough money to get out of the neighborhood I&#39;m living in right now
 
&gt; &#34;Is it a &#34;bad&#34; neighborhood?&#34;
 
-  It&#39;s the place rich people live in their nightmares
 
&gt; &#34;Thankfully, I don&#39;t need to worry about money like you humans.&#34;

-  I think I would need to be blessed by some god if I became wealthy enough to not worry about my spending habits
 
&gt; &#34;This in the SCP Foundation; anything is possible!&#34;

-  I guess you&#39;re right about that. I&#39;ve heard some staff talking about some crazy things!
 
&gt; &#34;I&#39;m connected to every database in this place. I could tell you everything in this foundation.&#34;

-  I&#39;d prefer not to be here for 10 years.
 
&gt; &#34;I&#39;d also prefer not trying to load a 5-terabyte file.&#34;

-  5-terabytes? I don&#39;t think I have that much memory in my brain!
 
&gt; &#34;I really don&#39;t think any human has!&#34;

-  Welp, the scientists say that I must follow them for more testing.
 
&gt; &#34;I will miss you. Let&#39;s hope you get to talk to me before you leave for good!&#34;
