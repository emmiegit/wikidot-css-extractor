&gt; I made it. Yeah, I did. It cost me everything, but I got through that door. And what I found on the other side was not worth the risk.
&gt; 
&gt; Let me rewind a bit, for anyone who finds this and has no idea what happened. If you don&#39;t know what the Foundation is, then I don&#39;t know how you got this note, and you should drop it right now. I will assume that you do know about the SCP Foundation, and so I&#39;ll skip all the warning crap. I don&#39;t have any fancy memetics anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; I was sent to test on SCP-1346. That&#39;s the corridor that freaks everyone out. Anyway, no one so far has made it past 100 meters without running. Except me. I was chosen because I&#39;m different somehow. Something about 3031, being immune, or something. Basically, I have much lower fear reactions than anyone else. I was the perfect test subject. I was shoved in alone with a cable attached to my back, and the door was closed behind me. It was pitch black, so I lit a flare. I was told if I didn&#39;t go down the creepy hallway, I would be &#34;terminated&#34;. Not likely. If this immunity was so rare, then they wouldn&#39;t just kill me. The radio in my ear squawked something about moving forwards. I began walking, holding the flare high to light up the tunnel. There wasn&#39;t much to notice. Just a tunnel. About forty meters in I felt like something was off. I looked around, but couldn&#39;t see anything. At somewhere like eighty meters, I was sweating. Yeah, things weren&#39;t right. I wasn&#39;t downright terrified, but I was scared, no question. I commented on this to the radio, and kept moving. I passed a chalk line marking 100 meters. Must have been put there by a rover. The doorway looked closer now, like it was only fifty meters away at most. I figured if I&#39;d made it this far, I could make it a little further. At around about 130 meters, I was freaking out. I felt like I was being watched. I begged to be let back out, but I was denied. So I kept walking. Wish I hadn&#39;t now.
&gt; 
&gt; I finally made it to within five meters of the door. It was right there, but I was rooted to the spot. I was so scared. I&#39;d never been this terrified of anything. Seriously, I was usually pretty calm, even when I thought I was gonna die. But this was something else. I was so close, yet so far. I nearly collapsed there, and that would have been the end for me, but the suits back at the entrance must have rigged me with a shock collar or something. A huge jolt ran through me, and for a second I forgot my fear. I stumbled forwards, and touched the door. Suddenly, it was like a gate had closed, and I felt fine. I even felt stupid for being afraid of a tunnel. I laughed in relief. The radio crackled in my ear, and I turned back to the door. There was a deep thumping coming from behind it, like the footsteps of a giant. I reached up to the valve, opening it enough for the door to swing open. The footsteps suddenly ceased, and I opened it up. The radio, which I could hear the suits through, suddenly went quiet.
&gt; 
&gt; I know whoever&#39;s reading this will want to know what was beyond that door. I won&#39;t tell you. All I will tell you is it&#39;s out now. SCP-1346 is a prison, and I&#39;m it&#39;s newest inmate. It must always have at least one thing inside it. So the thing that was in there before got out, and I got put in. Suffice to say, I can&#39;t talk about the thing that got out. If I did, this paper would be gone in a few minutes of me sliding it under that huge door. All I can say is, good luck containing it. I mean that.

Note found at far-end of SCP-1346 by electromagnetically shielded drone approximately 1 week after incident SCP-1346-[DATA EXPUNGED].

Research is ongoing into whether SCP-1346 could be used for containment purposes.</textarea></pre>
