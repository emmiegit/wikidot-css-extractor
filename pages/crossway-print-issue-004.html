[STORY]
{Weather Report}
“It’s going to rain soon,” said the strange figure wearing sunglasses and riding a bicycle. “Get ready.”
After which, the figure cycled away in a flash of lightning and we never saw him again. Except, we did, but that’s a few years into the future and we don’t want to break the space-time continuum just yet (whatever that means).
And the shady figure was actually correct, as our weather balloons have predicted a sudden change in the weather. But before we briefly brush over the weather for tomorrow, we have an important announcement to make. The Meteorological Station of the district Fade is looking for new employees. So if you have abilities to look into the future or any scientific background on weather patterns and meteorology, head down to our main office on Cross Street 47 and queue up for an interview. And now onto the weather.

It feels like the rain is never going to stop. It’s been raining for a whole month now and that giant cloud doesn’t seem to be moving. Most citizens of our district are experiencing severe flooding in their apartments as well as in their minds. But this horrid weather is finally coming to an end. With spring just around the corner, the east winds will finally move the clouds away from our district and onto the uncharted wilderness. Tomorrow, on Monday 4th, there will be a light drizzle, however in the afternoon the weather is going to clear and the sun will finally shine upon our pale faces. Then, on Tuesday 5th, the cloudy and stormy weather will feel like a bad nightmare with sunshine coming down onto our grey, cracked roofs. The pools of water that we got so used to will slowly dry up and your umbrellas can finally have a rest. However, this seems like a drastic change, doesn’t it? What if instead of the rainy and misty weather we’ve been having for weeks now, we’ll suddenly get a heat wave? That doesn’t seem fun at all! And it isn’t. But lucky for us, that’s not going to happen, as our weather balloons predicted a light breeze on Wednesday and then a bit of a wind on Thursday. On Friday, however, we might get a weak hurricane, but the Ministry of Housing and the Ministry of Infrastructure reassured us that the structures will withstand such heavy winds. Saturday will suffer some serious heat, but on Sunday we’ll get a nice, cloudy weather that will help us cool down a bit.

[STORY]
{(De)Construction}
Across your house stood another house which was not a very surprising fact. At the bottom of the house where different shops infected the living area grew a construction site. Another shop was being built. Growing. Expanding. Taking over the apartment block.

The next day, standing in your living room, wearing your bathrobe and holding a newly made coffee cup, you looked outside. The cup itself was very hot, difficult to hold and the coffee itself was cold as ice. Seems that the Coffee Dispenser O’Matic machine is acting up recently, maybe you should take it to Old Wiley, he knows how to deal with those things.
The shop you noticed the other day was growing larger, it seems that it is some supermarket chain, though you were not sure of its nature. You saw that the progress of the construction wasn’t really made. In fact, you watched as the construction workers took it apart, brick by brick until the whole house smashed into the ground with a loud thump.

The next morning, as you were walking to work, you decided to take a closer look at that newly opened shop. The shop opened yesterday, big, green letters said: “Time Management”.
You walked in and saw yourself. And then you saw yourself again, this time you were a bit older. You walked up to the shop counter and saw yourself again, a younger version however. You looked yourself in the eye and knew exactly why you came here. To apply for a new job of course!

The next morning you stood in front of your window, overlooking the park across your house. It was nice that they decided to build this park instead of going for a new apartment block. You couldn’t even imagine having to see ugly, grey buildings every day.

The next morning the morning did not come. Neither did it come the day after that. Neither did it come yesterday. It came, however, on Sunday when you had a day off from your new job in the “Time Management” shop. Working in it was a wild ride, you attended your own funeral, saw your future wife be born and even declined your own CV in an attempt to stop the loop. But the loop continued, imprisoning you outside of time. You lived now and then. Never and always. Forever going insane.

&lt;i&gt;“— Why are you wearing sunglasses?&lt;br&gt;— Your face makes my day brighter and I don’t want to go blind yet.”&lt;/i&gt;

[STORY]
{The Circus}
It’s finally here. Your favourite season of the year — the Fair. Colourful tents, laughter and fun games cherish the start of Spring. But what is that? A new tent? You have not seen it before, not last year, not the year before that. Its bright, red and yellow stripes stand out among the regular green overhangs. Its music, slow and smooth, quickly speeding up and playing as if the show would soon begin, but then dying out as suddenly as it came to life. And the people working inside, clowns and magicians, acrobats and most importantly — the Troupe Master.

Everyone gathered around the newcomers. Our district is not a very famous tourist attraction and we don’t get visitors very often, so it came as a surprise when this caravan arrived in our area. Everybody knew who they were. The Circus.
Of course we’ve heard tales of the mysterious Circus. We knew that they often travelled from land to land, presenting awe-inspiring shows. But we also knew of the cost. For every show came with a cost. And the cost was great, greater than anything we’ve ever paid in our entire lives. Greater than anybody would want to pay. And the cost of the show was human lives.
That spring, seeing the Circus for the very first time, we were naive. Foolish to think that it was safe to approach these strangers. At first nothing happened. But as the crowd grew larger, the show began. We still remember that horrible day.

First were the clowns, there were three of them, all wearing big, red noses and wigs. Joking around, spraying each other with water, giving fake flowers to the audience. But then their behaviour changed. You noticed that some members of the audience started to laugh hysterically. Almost choking on their own spit, unable to breathe. Unable to stop laughing. You too started to laugh but managed to stop before it was too late. But for others? Well, they weren’t as lucky as you were. Slowly as the show progressed, many people stopped laughing. Lying on the ground. Breathless.
Next was the magician. He politely chose a member of the audience to help him with a trick. Putting the woman inside a box and cutting it with a real saw. And, surprisingly, the woman was alive. She was safe, not dead, not cut in half. It was what came later that killed her. The next trick with the same box, closing the little window and spinning it around. And when the door opened, she was gone.
After came the acrobats, most likely the only safe performers, for they did not kill anyone, apart from an old man who had a heart attack due to their performance. The doctors, however, reassured everybody that he already had a pre-existing medical condition and that his death was a complete accident.

And finally, the person who was behind this all. The person whom we shouldn’t have trusted. The Troupe Master. At first sight — a regular looking man. A hat, a cane and a cape. At that time we did not know what demon hid beneath the skin. His speech was short, quick and to the point. He thanked all of us for coming. Noticing you among the crowd, he asked you to come to the stage.
“As for our last number,” he said as you walked towards him, “We shall perform a dance.”
Grabbing your wrist and violently squeezing it to the point of bleeding, he started dancing with you. And he danced and danced, swirling around, jumping and then coming towards you again. You danced with him, your feet making your body light, as if you were a feather. You knew exactly what you were doing. You knew this dance your whole life, so it felt. And when the music reached its climax, the Troupe Master grabbed you and threw you up in the air and then caught you. And the audience roared and applauded to both of you. 
After everyone left, you too wanted to go. But you couldn’t. The tent closed, you were left alone with the Troupe Master.
“Welcome aboard,” he spoke and led you to the dressing room. And so, the new member of the Circus that night has been chosen. Good luck.

{Reflection}
Do not trust your own reflection. It’s as simple as that. I mean, it’s not that difficult, is it? After all, they are scientists. They know what they are doing. And you’ll get fifty pounds for this experiment. Just sit in the room full of mirrors and there you have it. And even if they had no idea what they were doing, your reflection can’t hurt you, can it? It just repeats after you, a copy, a parody. What’s the worst that cou—
What was that? What did you just see? Did it move? Oh, it was just you. Why are your hands shaking? There’s nothing to worry about, it’s just a mirror. A mirror, a chair and you. And your reflection. Is he staring? Why is he staring? No, it’s just you looking at yourself. It’s been what, ten, fifteen minutes? When are those guys coming back?
Why is your hand moving? Is it your reflection? But your reflection repeats after you, right? Just put it down, right there, yeah. That’s better. Maybe closing your eyes would help. Breath in... Breathe out... Breathe in...
Why can’t you breathe out? What’s happening? Why is your reflection looking at you menacingly? No, you’re just going crazy, there is nothing to worry about. Well, maybe apart from you suffocating. Breathe out. Finally.
You should probably shave that beard. It doesn’t look good. Maybe it’s the mirror? You should probably ask Clare about that. She is a physicist, she knows a ton about mirrors.
Is it moving again? Yes, you saw it move! Right there! It even winked once! You are definitely going crazy. How long has it be—
Why is your hand moving? Why are you trying to choke yourself? Stop! Stop repeating after your reflection! Oh god... It’s not your reflection. It&#39;s you.
&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&lt;i&gt;— A note from the Research Centre laboratory&lt;/i&gt;

[INTER]&lt;h2&gt;Public Service Announcement&lt;/h2&gt;
It is right there. Can&#39;t you see it? It&#39;s right over there, just behind you. Yes, yes, a little bit to the left. No, I said to the left! You&#39;re going right, just for your knowledge. No, now you&#39;re going backwards. Are you even listening to me?

Oh, you&#39;re here! I was just talking to my pet rat. In case you were wondering, today&#39;s Public Service Announcement was made by a local man named Jefferey. He just wanted to say that whomever trashes his shop every evening should stop, unless they want to get into trouble.
&#34;Real trouble,&#34; Jefferey whispered into one of our editor&#39;s ear and the man had a heart attack! Now who&#39;s doing the bad thing, Jefferey? You have to pay for our staff shortage now, we lost a very good and experience editor! Unfortunately, we can&#39;t use this section of our newspaper as an advertisement, but if you have some editing experience — head to our office at Cross Street 24 and apply for a position. Don&#39;t worry, the pens won&#39;t bite you here — they&#39;re tamed.
