&#34;Single Issue Voters&#34; by: ManyMeats
 
Stay tuned for more.  This was inspired by the satirical work from Stellaris called &#34;Xenonion&#34;.

She stared at the television, barely catching a word as each channel buzzed in then out.  The white fuzz was cut by the dulcet tones of traffic filtering in through the cracked window; a pleasant spring Sunday that seemed so innocent before the programming suggested otherwise.

We join a broadcast in progress.  The anchor, a stern man in a blue wool suit, sat far too on top of his news desk.  &#34;The President&#39;s address from the Rose Garden was interrupted yesterday by Big Giant Spacerock who announced they will be seeking the Republican Party&#39;s nomination.  The announcement, which beamed directly--&#34;

And just as soon as it was getting good the channel was flipped.

&#34;You know, I heard programs only have something like 20 seconds max to grab and capture the attention of a casual viewer.  Any truth to that rumor?&#34;  Bemused as he was, her husband couldn&#39;t even bring himself to watch the television anymore when he had even the faintest alternative.

She flipped several more channels.  &#34;Huh?&#34;

&#34;I&#39;m sure you heard me.&#34;

&#34;Yeah but it&#39;s funnier if you think I didn&#39;t.&#34;

&#34;Yes, you&#39;re very funny.  So clever.&#34;

&#34;Anything good out there?&#34;

&#34;Not much,&#34; he smirked looking out the window, noting how suave he looked in his reflection.  &#34;There have been an awful lot of choppers headed to and from Site 17 today though.  Wonder what&#39;s going on.&#34;

&#34;What do you think about this &#39;Big Giant Spacerock&#39; running?&#34;  She ignored his plot hook in favor of her own, although the two were inextricably linked.

&#34;Oh, I dunno...&#34; he slipped his hands into his pockets and turned toward her, his shadow falling across her face and blocking the midday sun.  &#34;It was certainly a bold way to announce.  Not like it really resonates with voters on any legitimate level though.&#34;

&#34;That&#39;s kind of weird to say when it hijacked the brains of everyone in the Western Hemisphere at the same time.  It kind of literally reached every voter in North America.&#34;

&#34;Yeah but that&#39;s cheating.  Like...how can you start your run by breaking campaign advertising law?&#34;

&#34;Well, who is going to stop it?  The FCC?  No, I really don&#39;t think so.  I, for one, am thankful we have a candidate that can cut through the red tape and just get their message out.&#34;

The TV flitter across another news desk, this once flanked by three pundits each trying to talk over each other and one unfortunate moderator silently clutching papers.

A large 60-something man in a poorly tailored suit was the first voice to win out, &#34;What&#39;s clear as day here is that they are not a legitimate candidate for the Presidency.  They are not a natural-born citizen.  End of discussion.  Finito.&#34;

A well kept 50-something woman with a shrill voice spoke up and cut through the others.  &#34;What guarantees do we have it will even keep its word and avoid Earth if elected?  How do we know it can be trusted?&#34;

Last but certainly not least, a steady-spoken 70-something gentleman was gradually rising up out of his seat, demonstratively pointing a finger to the other side of the desk, wagging it around like a mace.  &#34;I&#39;ll tell you what this is a test.  This is a call from the beyond that we need, we need to...we need to put our faith in God and trust not in the words of false prophets.  We need to--&#34;

The moderator sighed as the channel was changed.

&#34;Next thing I know you&#39;re going to tell me that it can really &#39;reach across the aisle&#39; or some other lame talking point like that.  Cheryl, I know you&#39;re smarter than that.  It&#39;s an autocrat, plain and simple.  The same ten pounds of shit in a five-pound bag every other politician serves up.&#34;  And with that, her husband turned back toward the window and away from her ironically narrow view.

&#34;Well, //David//, I just think you should be open to its plan.  And that you should also consider the alternative.&#34;

&#34;That our votes are being held hostage by a sapient exoplanet and if we don&#39;t elect it the damn thing might pass close enough to //sunder Earth&#39;s mantle//?  Yeah, that has occurred to me.&#34;

There was a long silence between the two.  Betty flipped more channels.

&#34;Have you ever thought about a third party candidate?&#34;
