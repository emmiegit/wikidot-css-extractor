**Item #:** SCP-1523

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1523 is to be secured in Storage Locker L at Site 40&#39;s Safe containment facility. When testing, SCP-1523 is to be lit with a handheld gas lighter. While SCP-1523 is burning, it is to be enclosed in an airtight chamber with all attending personnel wearing gas masks to avoid propagation or inhalation of SCP-1523 smoke. 

All interactions with SCP-1523 are to be recorded and filed in Interview Log 1523. When testing is concluded, SCP-1523 is to be extinguished promptly. The object is never to burn while unattended.  

**Description:** SCP-1523 is an orange-brown incense coil. While SCP-1523 is burning, the object displays sapience; it is responsive to verbal stimuli and capable of speech, using a voice identical to that of a musician named █████████████[[footnote]]Name withheld due to Operation Stargazer protocol.[[/footnote]] The object possesses complete memory of █████&#39;s life[[footnote]]Born in 1951, █████████████ achieved fame in the 1970s as a rhythm-and-blues singer, known for his characteristic low voice and range, as well as his brief time spent as a member of the band [[[SCP-092|The Fifth Dimension]]].[[/footnote]]. The Foundation cannot determine whether SCP-1523 held the same personality traits in life; its current demeanor, including its obsession with religion, may result from its current form.

According to SCP-1523&#39;s account, it was created on 05/04/05 in a &#34;star chapel&#34; of the North American cult known as the [[[fifthist-hub|Fifth Church]]] during a &#34;cleansing ritual&#34;. SCP-1523 was stored in a closet, suspended on an incense holder which bore a tag reading &#34;BROTHER █████ TERRES TRIAL MIND&#34;. Following a Foundation sting (see **EID Operations Report 6-11-05**, &#34;Operation Stargazer&#34;), several ritual items were secured, including SCP-1523, which underwent experimentation due to its unusual nomenclature, then was designated and contained.

**Addendum 1523-A**: After testing (see interview logs), it has been determined that SCP-1523&#39;s ability to hear and speak is a property of its smoke, rather than of the object itself. Although SCP-1523 is apparently not conscious when unlit, attempts to determine the range and duration at which SCP-1523 smoke retains its effect have been inconclusive. Note that Site 40 cleaning procedures are to be strictly enforced, to prevent the contamination of the facility with SCP-1523.

&gt; Note: All information pertaining to classified Fifthist activity has been redacted as per Operation Stargazer protocol.

&gt; **Interviewer**: //[The interviewer provides SCP-1523 with standard introductory information for contained humanoids.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1523**: Call me ████████, star-exalted brother.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer**: I will keep using your designation, if that&#39;s alright. So can you confirm that you are ████████ █████?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1523**: No doubt.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer**: And you&#39;re aware of your state?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1523**: Very.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer**: Are you capable of anything besides speech?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1523**: Hertz, brother, I can sing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer**: Can you perform something for the record?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1523**: You got any requests? 
&gt; 
&gt; //[The security officer suggests &#34;Let&#39;s Stay Together&#34;, a standard which [REDACTED] occasionally performed in concert.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1523**: It serves, brother. It serves. Let me put a spin on it.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-1523 performs a completely different piece with a dissonant melody and lyrics which are presumed to refer to Fifthist doctrines. The first verse consists of the phrase &#34;there is power in the blood&#34; repeated in different cadences. Full lyrics are available in the unabridged transcript.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer**: //[pause]// That will do. Can you tell us how you were placed in your current state?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1523**: Wisdom serves. It was a [REDACTED] cleansing ritual. Everyone was in the groove as the archon played. Spinning like records. Screaming like records, too. //[laughs]// My [REDACTED] unhinged like a snake&#39;s jaw, and my soul came forth, brother. The archon stuck it here for posterity.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer**: What happened to your body?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1523**: Still going strong. It doesn&#39;t miss me much.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer**: You&#39;re saying that your body continues to function without a consciousness.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1523**: No, brother, without a soul. Ever seen an anthill? That ant doesn&#39;t have room for a soul in there. If a man has no soul, he can keep building his anthill just fine. Right now the man I was is occupied with [REDACTED] and you couldn&#39;t tell the difference if you met it, unless you were giving it a throat exam. //[laughs]// He&#39;s quiet in there, but he wriggles around like he can&#39;t get comfortable.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer**: Is this a common phenomenon?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1523**: More than you think, brother. I&#39;d bet my blood there are brothers and sisters working with you in this building whose souls left a long time ago. Bodies serve, too. But those sweet souls [REDACTED] in time. It&#39;s coming for them in time.

[[collapsible show=&#34;Interview 1523-02&#34; hide=&#34;Close&#34;]]
&gt; Note: This interview, like the previous one, was conducted in a standard humanoid interview chamber, and as such, the only precaution taken was the presence of a security official. This interview was conducted by a different researcher than the previous conversation: Dr. ███████ is a 35-year-old woman.
&gt; 
&gt; Begin log, start time 12:31:10
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer**: Can you tell us anything about the chapel you attended?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1523**: I can tell you that it was wonderful. What was it the man said? &#34;Oh my it, God&#39;s full of stars.&#34; //[laughs]//
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer**: I&#39;m more interested in knowing their rituals and beliefs.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1523**: I&#39;m more interested in you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer**: Can we please stay on the subject, SCP-1523?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1523**: Sister, I&#39;m tired of talking about myself. I haven&#39;t spoken to a woman in too long, and you&#39;ve got too much going on to be so impersonal.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer**: This is inappropriate.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1523**: Don&#39;t get ahead of me, now. Just tell me about yourself, sister.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer**: [Security Officer] ████, how do I get him back on subject?
&gt; 
&gt; **Security Officer**: SCP-1523, answer her questions.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1523**: Sister, lean a little closer. Take a deep breath. There&#39;s something I need to tell you.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer**: This is ridiculous.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1523**: You want me to be helpful. Do your brother a favor. //[The interviewer complies.]// Mmm, that&#39;s it. Hope you like the smell of sandalwood, baby. I want to linger on your clothes all day.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer**: SCP-1523, what are the central tenets of the Fifth Church?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1523**: Just so you know, I&#39;m not the body, baby. I&#39;m the smoke. Every particle in the air&#39;s my senses, like the sweet tendrils of [REDACTED]. Breathe in, breathe out. It&#39;s so comfortable in your chest, sister.
&gt; 
&gt; **Interviewer**: This is over. I&#39;m getting the hell out of here.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-1523**: Don&#39;t be scared, baby. You&#39;ll hyperventilate trying to get me out. But you can&#39;t. I know you&#39;ll be a stranger to me, but I&#39;ll see you &#39;round. My body burns and rests and burns, but I&#39;ll be on the air 24/7, if you know what I mean. //[laughs]// I&#39;ll see you in your office.
