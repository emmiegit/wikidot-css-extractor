    <pre><textarea class="page-source" readonly>**Name:** Ted &#34;Tedly&#34; Anderson

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Duties:** Exploration and description of hyper-real dimensions

**Location:** Site -1

**History:** Anderson was a promising researcher into textual SCPs when a completely unexpected and irreproducible interaction between SCPs-████ and -████ sent him hurtling into a meta-dimension in which the SCP Foundation is nothing but the crazed scribblings of various internet personalities on an easily-edited website. Though Anderson has been able to make contact with the &#34;real&#34; Foundation, at present he is posted in this meta-dimension to research its peculiarities—in particular its seeming total lack of anomalous objects.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Notes from Site -1&#34; hide=&#34;- Notes from Site -1&#34;]]
Listed in the order in which they were created.

&gt; **SCP-1633:** My first SCP, and still my most popular, probably due to the simplicity of the idea. I&#39;ll be honest: &#34;video game that plays you&#34; isn&#39;t the most original concept out there, and I didn&#39;t try to do anything particularly new with it. I&#39;m still not happy with the suicide note, but I think it needs to be there, to explain the role that Kr&#39;th&#39;nar plays in the game. On the other hand, I&#39;m pretty proud of the recovery log.
&gt; 
&gt; Incidentally, I would love to have a &#34;screenshot&#34; from the game for the article. If there are any talented Photoshoppers out there who want to help, drop me a line! I imagine it would look like //Marvel: Ultimate Alliance// played in the //Thief// universe.

&gt; **SCP-1304:** Definitely the SCP I&#39;m most proud of, mostly because I&#39;m a big fan of metafiction and stories that explore the difference (or lack thereof) between fiction and reality. Earlier drafts had a longer list of the necessary elements of the ritual, but I figured it was superfluous. I had to be careful to make sure the Foundation couldn&#39;t take advantage of the ritual themselves, to make sure (as one commenter suggested) that they couldn&#39;t simply have someone write a story about The Super-Cool Guy Who Killed 682.
&gt; 
&gt; And yeah, it&#39;s a corny effect, but it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve done anything like that in a story. And if you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, poke through the comments for a while.

&gt; **SCP-1788:** My greatest failure. Will elaborate later.

&gt; **SCP-1258:** My most divisive article yet, and (not coincidentally) one of my favorites. I know it comes awfully close to furry territory, but that&#39;s honestly not where I was going with it. A lot of people tried to guess the inspiration for this, but it&#39;s not //Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles// or //Kung Fu Panda// or anything like that. If you want to have the mystery spoiled for you, [http://nedroid.com/2007/12/1411-karatefight-dog/ click this link]. (SFW)
