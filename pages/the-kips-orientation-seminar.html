Come in come in, plenty of seats for everyone. I&#39;ll be starting soon so get comfortable, get your coffee or tea before I start please. No no, hold your questions until the end of the orientation please, I haven&#39;t even started yet. 

What?

Yes that includes, &#34;Where am I?&#34;

Everyone situated now? Good, let&#39;s begin. 

Good afternoon everyone, my name is Professor Lee Usti, but you can simply call me Professor, and if you have found yourself seated here today it is because you have a desire to know more about the unknown, and to spread that knowledge to people around the world who desire it. Welcome to the Kroenburg Institute for Paranormal Studies. I am the founder of this Institute and if you are lucky enough one of your instructors. 

The Kroenburg Institute for Paranormal Studies, or KIPS for short, is a primarily self study organization. We encourage our student body to research and discover paranormal, abnormal, or as certain, undesirable groups would call, anomalous objects, entities, etc and learn about them as safely or naturally as possible. 

Our staff will assist you in whatever area of study you choose whether it be mechanical advancements, cryptozoology, thamauturgy, parapharmacuticals, pataphysics, quantum mixintanglement, multiversal connection diplomacy, and more. A full list of staff and their specialties can be found in the main hall. 

What sets us apart from similar organizations that study and deal with the peternatural world, such as the SCP Foundation, the GOC which funds ICSUT, or the Serpent&#39;s Hand, we desire to educate the world about the mind twisting wonders that exist beside them, not hide them away, not use them for power, or release them to be wild and cause chaos. We firmly believe here in KIPS that knowledge is not power, but education is. 

We know that not everyone agrees with our perspective, and many would rather silence us, so that&#39;s why out quaint little campus is here, in an area no one would care to look. Fresno California. Being in the exact center of the state, this city radiates faint magical energy, that we could harness to hide our work from prying eyes. If you have questions about this process please see Carol after this orientation is over for thaumaturgy studies.

Now, questions? 

Yes, the young man in the blue polo? Hm? Yes despite our disagreements in our view of the anomalous world graduates from KIPS have found employment in various normalcy organizations such as the SCP Foundation, the Global Occult Coalition, and even the Horizon Initiative has accepted some graduates from our advanced religious miracle studies. Some have been hired by Marshal Carter and Dark as appraisers, some taken on roles as creative design for Dr. Wondertainment. 

Hm? No of course no one&#39;s joined any of the terrorist groups. I hope. 

Next question? Yes, the kind faced student in the yellow sundress? Do I have a super power? My inquisitive but mislead friend we are not in a comic book, ask Author in pataphysics he&#39;ll explain narratives to you. However if you sign up for my reality warping studies course, I might be able to show you a neat trick I can do. 

Any further questions? Ah, I see we have a fae with us today with a question. Go on ahead. Hm? Why yes of course enrollments are open for more than just humans. Fae, android, Ortothan, clown, Yeren, Nobodies, cyborgs, Alagaadans, all are welcome to receive education. 

Well, if that are no further questions then I will call this orientation dismissed. Welcome to the Institute everyone, remember that there is always something more to learn in this world, and once you&#39;ve learned it all just reach another world!
