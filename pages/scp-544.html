**Item #:** SCP-544

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Euclid (Class updated after Event 544-423245 by order of O5-█)

**Special Containment Procedures:** When not in use, SCP-544 is to be kept in a standard 1 m x 1 m x 1 m locked storage container. When in use, the bearer of SCP-544 is to be under visual and auditory surveillance at all times. In the event that SCP-544 is to be removed from a bearer, it is to be only done by legally deaf staff in Auditory Safe Room #524264.

**Description:** SCP-544 is a 30 cm tall hand-held radio microphone, made of polished metal and black plastic. There is no evidence of wires or electrical plugs of any kind on the object. The object&#39;s surface reveals significant but superficial damage (presumably from everyday use). When jostled, the sound of a non-metallic object can be heard inside the device. Requests to disassemble SCP-544 to identify this object have been denied.

When grasped by the &#39;neck&#39; of the microphone, the bearer will gain a subtle but significant compulsion to keep SCP-544 in his or her possession at all times. This compulsion begins as a simple dislike for the idea of letting go of SCP-544, but inevitably culminates in a desire to keep SCP-544 in a pocket or other carrying method at all times. Attempts to retrieve SCP-544 when the bearer is asleep have generally resulted in Separation Events (see below).

After two days of bearing SCP-544, it will begin to speak for its bearer, through methods unknown. The sound SCP-544 makes is identical to the bearer&#39;s original voice, and the bearer does not seem to notice that this voice-replacement is occurring until explained. As time passes, more and more of the subject&#39;s speech is replaced by SCP-544, and the vocal tone of SCP-544 becomes much more electronic, with a comical and jovial tone. Within two weeks, the bearer is completely voiced by SCP-544.[[footnote]] In █ separate test cases, subjects bearing SCP-544 were noted as rarely saying the following words normally, if weakly: //Why//, //Speaker//, //Shroud//, and [EXPUNGED]. The latter, believed to be of Mesoamerican origin, has been uttered the most.[[/footnote]]

Attempts to remove SCP-544 from the bearer&#39;s possession result in what has been dubbed a Separation Event. SCP-544 will produce a screeching tone in order to incapacitate those that wish to gain SCP-544. The decibel levels of Separation Events have ranged from 140-150db, causing significant discomfort and pain. The original bearer of SCP-544 is somewhat affected, but to a severely lesser degree. Incapacitating the bearer before attempting to acquire SCP-544 causes the same Separation Event. After the Event, its original bearer recovers normally, with the exception of being unable to speak at all. Autopsy of bearer&#39;s brains revealed near-complete atrophy of posterior inferior frontal gyrus section, commonly known as Broca&#39;s Area. Because of the risk to personnel nearby when Separation Events occur, O5-█ has ordered that all operations done to retrieve SCP-544 are to be done in Auditory Safe Rooms (ASRs), rooms specifically designed to mitigate and reduce sound-related issues.

**Addendum-1:** Interview with SCP-544-bearing subject

&gt; **Interview Date:** 04/12/20██
&gt; **Interviewer:** Researcher ████████
&gt; **Subject:** D-78909
&gt; **Current amount of time Subject has borne SCP-544:** One week, two days
&gt; //**Please note:** By this time, a significant percentage of D-78909&#39;s vocalizations come from SCP-544. In the interest of clarity, sections in which SCP-544 is &#39;speaking&#39; will be// {{written like this}}//, in keeping with SCP-544&#39;s higher, electronic &#39;voice&#39;. As is standard with this effect upon its bearers, D-78909 does not notice (or does not seem to care) when he stops using his mouth to stop in the middle of a sentence.//
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; ████████**:** And how are we today, 78909? I see you&#39;ve taken to stuffing SCP-544 into your pocket.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-78909:** Yes, it was {{getting a bit annoying having to hold this thing}} in my hands. Plus, it fits pretty {{well, don&#39;t you think?}}
&gt; 
&gt; ████████**:** True, but have you considered returning it to us? What are you using it for?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-78909:** //(shrugs)// Nah, {{why would I want to give this up? I like it. Believe it}} or not, most of the other D-Class folks think {{I&#39;m higher up on the food chain because I&#39;ve got this thing. Stupid gangbanging}} [RACIAL INSULT]s, they think owning an {{old-time radio microphone is some version of a gang sign! Would you believe}} that they occasionally try to take the [EXPLETIVE]ed thing when I&#39;m sleeping. [EXPLETIVE]ing {{[RACIAL INSULT]}}s. Have they forgotten they&#39;re in friggin&#39; //jail//? This isn&#39;t //Detroit//, for {{God&#39;s sake}}! 
&gt; 
&gt; ████████**:** Let&#39;s refrain from racial insults, 78909, and mind your tone. You&#39;re in jail with them too. Tell me more about what happens when they try to take it from you?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-78909:** {{Fine, fine, sorry about the cursing. Anyways, I&#39;m a light sleeper, so the minute I feel their dirty little mitts unzipping}} my pocket, I&#39;m awake. Then the metal noise starts up, and they start  clutching their heads like it&#39;s a bullhorn. They {{back off, and I go back to sleep}}.
&gt; 
&gt; ████████**:** Metal noise?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-78909:** {{You know, that noise it makes when someone tries to take it. You guys installed it}}, right, so that nobody steals it from me? {{What was that stupid horn those Africans played at soccer games so much that everyone hated? Like that, but more}} synthetic. A lot quieter, too. {{Have to give you boys credit, it&#39;s a perfect &#34;Stop Touching My}} [EXPLETIVE]&#34; alarm sound. //(winces)// Sorry, sorry, I know, {{don&#39;t swear}}. Force of {{habit}}.
&gt; 
&gt; ████████**:** Ah yes, that &#39;metal noise&#39;. We made that noise for military discouragement operations. //(pause)// What would you say if I told you that you keep alternating between speaking with your voice, and that microphone speaking for you?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-78909:** {{I&#39;d laugh at you, because you guys tried that trick a few days after you gave me this}} thing. You guys told me to randomly talk {{while looking into what you guys //said// was a mirror. Of course, it wasn&#39;t a mirror, since I stopped talking a few times in the}} //(does &#39;air quotes&#39;)// reflection, while I kept talking. {{Freaked me out a bit, but then I realized you guys just recorded me standing somewhere, doing nothing, and used that fancy CGI [EXPLETIVE] to make it //look// like I wasn&#39;t talking}} a few words. Nice try, Doc.
&gt; 

**Addendum-2:** Event 544-Alpha

On 05/24/20██ at 3:42am, the current bearer of SCP-544 (D-423245) was asleep in his bunk. While undisturbed and remaining asleep, SCP-544 began to speak seemingly-random phrases. It was initially assumed that D-423245 was simply &#39;talking in his sleep&#39;, until SCP-544 began speaking things which could not have possibly been dream-based. Later bearers of SCP-544 repeated many of the following lines in their sleep. For a full listing, please see file 544.FullLog.353. 

&gt; I was slumbering. I was waking. Flames! Fire! Burning! I slumbered again. 
&gt; There is no ███. There is no ███. There is no barrier. 
&gt; The slab groans. I groan to match. We rise together. 
&gt; When? When? When? 
&gt; I dreamed until the dawn, but the it was not dawn. It was false! Dawn That Was Not A Dawn. Dreams turned to dust. 
&gt; The number was [EXPUNGED]. The number is [EXPUNGED]
&gt; No, not time. Not yet. No. Wait and dream. Wait and dream.

Event 544-Alpha, and later similar situations, has caused the Foundation to re-evaluate SCP-544&#39;s nature. It is currently not understood how SCP-544 (or its multiple bearers) have a knowledge of SCP-███, much less how SCP-███ has anything in common with SCP-544. More startling is 544&#39;s mentioning of the specific lat/long of Foundation Overwatch. In response to Event 544-423245, SCP-544 has been upgraded to Euclid status.

**Addendum-2:** Event 544-Beta

On 09/15/20██ at 4:01am, the current bearer of SCP-544 (D-64349) was seen walking around the medical cell he had been contained in due to a common illness. Conversation with D-64349, speaking through SCP-544, began shortly thereafter. To date, there have been ██ attempts to forcibly re-create the events of 544-Beta, with no success.

&gt; **Dr. █████████:** Up and about, 64349? Feeling better?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-64349:** //(long pause)// Buried.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** Excuse me?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-64349:** //(unintelligible)//
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** Please repeat yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; **D-64349:** //(long pauses between words begin here and continue throughout the conversation)// Perversion. Corruption of the method. I am trod under those who exist to serve me. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** //(realizes he&#39;s not talking with D-64349)// What method are you speaking of? Does the person I&#39;m talking to exist to serve you?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-64349:** Touch the stone. Become my voice. Speak my truths and my rules to the people. I warned them. Popocatépetl[[footnote]]A volcano located in Mexico.[[/footnote]] was the warning. Warning of corruption. Arrival. Destruction.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** What happened?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-64349:** //(extremely long pause)// My voice was not protected. Pretenders to my Glory usurped me. Shattered. Disregarded. I slept.
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** And what caused you to wake up? Do you remember when?
&gt; 
&gt; **D-64349:** //(shakes head)// Shard of me. Not enough. The //cerdos//[[footnote]]Spanish for &#39;pig&#39;.[[/footnote]]! Treated like //(unknown, translations suggest &#39;bearer of wooden collar&#39;)//. Blasphemy. Touch the stone, become my voice. Touched the stone, spoke for them. //(rapidly, alternating between Nahuatl, Spanish, and English)// Arrogance! Arrogance! Arrogance! Arrogance! Arrogance!
&gt; 
&gt; //(At this point, D-64349 awoke, presumably by the sound of SCP-544. He turns to face Dr. █████████, who startles him.)//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-64349:** Jesus wept, doctor. Do you get your jollies off watching patients get up to take a piss?
&gt; 
&gt; **Dr. █████████:** None of your business, D. Good night.
