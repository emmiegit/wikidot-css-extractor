++ __Special Containment Procedures__
[[/=]]

SCP-5938 has been disassembled, and its components have been contained within Site-94&#39;s DEEPWELL-319, kept under surveillance by the Department of Applied Thaumatology. Should a proposal regarding SCP-5938&#39;s activation pass, the anomaly is to be assembled and shipped under the property of an MTF Aleph-11 agent.

Any evidence of SCP-5938 attacks is to be notified to [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-300|Site-300&#39;s Department of Public Outreach]]] in order to create new cover stories and disinformate the public, along with the sending of MTF Aleph-11 (&#34;Hecate&#39;s Spearwielders&#34;) in order to administer amnestics on any witnesses.

**UPDATE 23/07/2028:** SCP-5938&#39;s current whereabouts are unknown, and containment has been deemed an Ekhi-Class priority.

++ __Description__
[[/=]]

SCP-5938 designates a thaumatological paraweapon, created and employed by the Department of Applied Thaumatology[[footnote]]A branch of the Department of Applied Force, focused in the creation and application of thaumaturgic paraweaponry in order to facilitate the Foundation&#39;s tactical, militaristic operations.[[/footnote]] in order to ease the termination of any targets focused by the Foundation.

The anomaly is similar in appearance to an AGS-17 grenade launcher, connected to an ARES Input Device.[[footnote]]A contraption by which operation commands can control a firearm&#39;s inner workings.[[/footnote]] SCP-5938&#39;s anomalous properties appear whenever a projectile is installed within its barrel, which holds up to 12 explosive rounds. Should a Site&#39;s command send an order onto SCP-5938&#39;s Input Device, the anomaly will modify its projectiles through several printing systems, and apply a desired thaumaturgic spell to the desired ones.

SCP-5938&#39;s stamping process is automatic, printing seals through the use of a secondary barrel in which proper liquids can be inserted prior to being shipped to an operation. Should said barrel be rotated while SCP-5938&#39;s projectile barrel is loaded, a cast will filter the liquid and paint the ordered spell.

* Immediate seals, printing them onto projectiles to apply the effects upon impact.
* Rituals, progressively filtering different liquids or contents in order to apply effects.
* Spells, filtering powdered contents onto the air to create mixtures.
* //Et cetera.//

The anomaly was created on December 27th, 2026, following an official announcement essayed by the Department of Applied Thaumatology, who mentioned the lack of productive paraweaponry within the department&#39;s MTFs. In order to fulfill this problem, SCP-5938 was engineered and a subproject was created to develop the anomaly&#39;s properties and capabilities.

++ __Addendum 5938.I__
++++ Commissioning Proposal
[[/=]]

While SCP-5938&#39;s creation approximately took 4 days in order to be carried out, the anomaly required to undergo bureaucratic paperwork prior to being designed, most likely due to the implementation of new guidelines and rules over the DoAT&#39;s activities. The following log includes a series of proposals and documents written by Pt. C. Abbett, originally made to request the creation of SCP-5938.

**Summary:** ATP-5938-014 consists of a series of paratechnological components, arranged together in order to create a thaumaturgic contraption by which the DoAT&#39;s activities can be accelerated and eased, fulfilling a certain section of the department&#39;s operations.

While one sole instance is planned to be created, the purpose is to obliterate any targets via the application of combustions, explosions, and other means using thaumaturgy. Following creation of ATP-5938-014, the anomaly will be assigned to MTF Aleph-11 (&#34;Hecate&#39;s Spearwielders&#34;) for further usage.

A group of 6 Foundation paratechnicians will fabricate and test the anomaly prior to doing so.

**Summary:** ATP-5938-014 refers to a thaumaturgically-altered ranged paraweapon, whose model is modified in such a manner that it resembles an AGS-17 grenade launcher.

**Reason:** Following the [[[fire and hate|Outback Incident,]]] the Department of Applied Thaumatology has suffered a decimation of personnel, later assembled to become MTF Samekh-42 (&#34;Ares&#39;s Chainbearers&#34;).[[footnote]]A task force comprised of unconscious, reanimated personnel.[[/footnote]] This result hasn&#39;t been deemed productive, however, to the majority of the department&#39;s activities, the increment in personnel or the paraweaponry production. In order to fulfill the DoAT&#39;s wartime affairs, ATP-5938-014 focuses on the obliteration of any hostile third parties targetted by the Foundation, specifically those who actively cause problems to the Veil.

As the teams advanced, the inhabitants noticed the personnel and thrusted themselves towards them in order to transmit SCP-5671-1. However, most of the anomaly were quickly decimated due to SCP-5938&#39;s anomalous capabilities, which caused all of the instances to amass into one single point via the use of thaumaturgy, prior to being incinerated. Following termination of the defending SCP-5671-2 instances, an investigation revealed that PoI-5671 had escaped the area during the Foundation raid. Whereabouts are currently unknown. Soon after, all L-12 and A-11 members were quarantined for a week. ||

|| PoI-7255 (&#34;Bradley Meyers&#34;)[[footnote]]An important Maxwellist recruiter and a notable Foundation target due to several database breaches. Also known for his practices of brainwashing and the dissemination of Veil-breaking information.[[/footnote]] || Lyndhurst, New Jersey. || A termination squad pertaining to MTF Aleph-11, along with 20 members of MTF Samekh-42 (&#34;Ares&#39;s Chainbearers&#34;) was deployed outside of a conference room in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. During initial exploration, no traces of the target were located, although as the forces advanced, the building&#39;s lighting began deteriorating. As Samekh-42 advanced to the building&#39;s basement, several modified civilians charged towards the team, decimating it into 12 members, although quickly defeated by S-42; when MTF Aleph-11 entered PoI-7255&#39;s room, the anomaly ambushed the team, manipulating several members through the use of telepathic abilities, although SCP-5938 was altered to create an electromagnetic pulse (EMP), causing PoI-7255 to fall to the floor due to his anomalous features. Lyndhurst was rendered out of electric activity temporally, and PoI-7255&#39;s body was transformed into more ammunition through the use of SCP-5938. ||

|| PoI-008 (&#34;Randall Carter&#34;) || Anchorage, Alaska || Due to PoI-008&#39;s proximity to Veil-breaking activities as one of MC&amp;D&#39;s primary liaisons,[[footnote]]PoI-008 is Robert Carter&#39;s biological cousin.[[/footnote]] attempts to capture and terminate him have been considered several times. However, the final decision to assassinate Mr. Carter lied on the massive spread of MC&amp;D&#39;s activities over the stock market. Following SCP-5938&#39;s assembly, FSH Maxwell was assigned to PoI-008&#39;s assassination, which took place within one of MC&amp;D&#39;s offices in Anchorage. During the assault, FSH Maxwell disguised as an MC&amp;D agent and accessed PoI-008&#39;s office, presenting SCP-5938 as an excuse to enter. While initially stopped by several guards who prohibited his access, the hitman quickly administered amnestics on them. Following entry to PoI-008&#39;s office, FSH Maxwell showcased Mr. Carter the anomaly, prior to stabbing him approximately 8 times on the torso. The hitman later escaped the room and left the building as evacuation orders were essayed. ||

|| EE-1709[[footnote]]A large, quasi-serpentine carnomantic entity, currently inhabiting a part of Uppsala&#39;s sewer system, known for causing a massive increment in nälkän citizenship within the county.[[/footnote]] || Uppsala, Sweden || Uppsala&#39;s sewers were accessed from a vantage point within the city&#39;s outskirts. As Aleph-11 accessed the system, several grenades were thrown to the water, prior to beginning an expedition throughout the structure. For 2 hours and 24 minutes, MTF Aleph-11 explored the sewage network until EE-1709 emerged, pulling one of the members to the water and devouring it. Following this, MTF Captain Foxtrot modified one of SCP-5938&#39;s projectiles, ejecting it towards the water to later absorb a portion. This led to EE-1709&#39;s second emergence, leading several members to shoot their harpoons towards the anomaly&#39;s cranium, which resisted the impact. As the anomaly began climbing the pavement, SCP-5938 was reloaded in order to affect its muscular tissue, and render it susceptible to the water. Thereafter, the anomaly was reloaded once again to absorb its blood upon impact, which led to the subsequent termination of EE-1709. ||

While the Foundation&#39;s initial involvement with Yaseni were null during infiltration within Esterberg, Aleph-11 was sent to try and assassinate him through the use of non-anomalous means. However, as GoI-120 forces began reuniting with the target, MTF Aleph-11 began being insistent on breaching the building. This led to the subsequent infiltration, although as soon as the reconnaissance team entered, the hostile forces began channeling thaumaturgy in order to defy Aleph-11. Following engagement, Mr. Yaseni channelled several HTOs,[[footnote]]Hemorrhagic-Thaumaturgic Offenses[[/footnote]] causing 6 casualties out of 13 in total, although he was quickly stabbed by the MTF&#39;s captain, Bravo, prior to being suddenly terminated by SCP-5938, which was shot by another member onto the PoI&#39;s cranium. All other members of GoI-120 later escaped the complex as new reinforcements began entering the nexus to apprehend them. ||

On July 21st, 2028, Site-94&#39;s surveillance cameras recorded SCP-5938&#39;s containment locker undergoing several alterations, prior to being subject to a containment breach that happened soon after. The following is a log of the containment breach, as recorded by the cameras:

**[00:00:00]** -- (//SCP-5938&#39;s parts are seen levitating within its containment locker. The anomaly seems to be activated, as the ARES Input Device is seen turned on. The locker, comprised of glass, begins filling with symbols.//)

**[00:02:14]** -- (//A pair of security guards are seen staring through the door&#39;s glass prior to entering the chamber. As the men open the steel hatch, the runes slowly begin glowing, rendering new spells within the room at large. The guards later escape the room, closing the door and calling in new reinforcements in the case of an unexpected containment breach.//)

**[00:03:23]** -- (//The locker explodes, along with the chamber as a whole. Several MTF Epsilon-11 (&#34;Nine-Tailed Fox&#34;) members begin entering the wing with harpoons and fishing nets; as the room&#39;s remains begin piling up autonomously on the hallway to form a wall, SCP-5938 is seen levitating towards the other side of the wing.//)

**[00:04:01]** -- (//The rubble falls to the floor, and Epsilon-11 crosses to the other side prior to reaching DEEPWELL-319&#39;s water supplies, in which SCP-5938 is located in. However, out of the blue, a projectile hits a water tank, causing a local [[[SCP-5961]]] event in the process. As Epsilon-11 tries to catch SCP-5938, which is now generating a humanoid entity with the spilling water, the chamber explodes, cutting the camera.//)

**[00:05:28]** -- (//The water is seen rushing towards the core of DEEPWELL-319, which is outdoors, prior to being channelled by SCP-5938, which is now controlled by SCP-5938-1, the aforementioned entity. SCP-5938-1 creates a series of [[[SCP-3688|kinetoglyphs]]], reverting all water towards the broken water tanks and closing them again. New reinforcements begin entering towards the core as SCP-5938-1 begins creating a thaumaturgic ritual.//)

**[00:07:10]** -- (//A group consisting of MTF Aleph-11 members enters the facility, as the ritual is finished by the anomaly. Suddenly, all of the paint within the facility&#39;s walls begins amassing and rushing towards DEEPWELL-319&#39;s core, before being concentrated into SCP-5938. Suddenly, an Epsilon-11 member throws a fishing net towards the anomaly, causing SCP-5938-1 to decompose and recompose itself, prior to manifesting a weapon out of its mass as it has no weaponry to defend itself. The anomaly attacks a pair of members before being assaulted.//)

**[00:08:27]** -- (//SCP-5938-1 dissolves itself, as it rushes towards SCP-5938, covering it and making it vanish temporally. The anomaly recomposes once again behind the team, prior to forcing itself through a member&#39;s mouth and transforming its mass into inorganic matter to add to its body. SCP-5938-1, now inside the member&#39;s suit, begins shooting and assaulting all present personnel with SCP-5938.//)

**[00:09:39]** -- (//SCP-5938-1 begins climbing the stairs towards the rest of Site-94 as reinforcements with additional weaponry begins entering the zone.//)

**[00:11:56]** -- (//The anomaly is tracked within Site-94&#39;s hallways as it shoots towards the wall with explosive charges, prior to manipulating all rubble to form newer walls. As it reaches the cafeteria, new reinforcements are seen shooting and decimating SCP-5938-1&#39;s suit into pieces, causing it to dissolve and protect SCP-5938.//)

**[00:14:16]** -- (//Dr. Matthew Chen, one of the DoAT&#39;s heads, enters the room and manipulates a kinetoglyph, stretching SCP-5938-1 while paralyzing it. Soon after, he generates a flame that covers the whole anomaly, causing it to drop SCP-5938. However, newer pseudo-instances of SCP-5938-1 begin generating, causing an illusion that forces Dr. Chen to quit the ritual.//)

**[00:16:49]** -- (//As the anomaly liberates itself, it rushes towards Site-94&#39;s emergency exit. However, an army composed out of both MTF Aleph-11 (&#34;Hecate&#39;s Spearwielders&#34;) and MTF Beta-777 (&#34;Hecate&#39;s Spear&#34;), along with Dr. Abbett and Lt. Catherine Campbell, begins performing several rituals with containment paratechnology, causing the anomaly to run before demanifesting into oblivion. Along with it, SCP-5938 is lost.//)

**[00:20:11]** -- (//SCP-5938 is seen right outside Site-94, along with a new SCP-5938-1 instance formed of grass that holds the anomaly, prior to running into the woods. Notably, the anomaly leaves a note generated out of the blue. The anomaly runs out of camera as the teams begin chasing them.//)

All attempts to find SCP-5938 were deemed inconclusive. As a result of the incident, no traces of the anomaly were found, and Foundation forces were tasked with executing a long-term expedition to find SCP-5938 and SCP-5938-1, which is still unsuccessful at the time of writing.

Analysis of the note revealed that it was comprised out of non-anomalous paper, and it was translated from Ancient Greek to English respectively:

&gt; = When magic is on man&#39;s hands, sky&#39;s the limit.

Traces of Akiva radiation were found nearby Site-94&#39;s entrance. It is unknown whether this is a connection to SCP-5938-1, or another anomaly.
