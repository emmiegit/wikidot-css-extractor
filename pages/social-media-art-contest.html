[[collapsible show=&#34;see the rules as they once were&#34; hide=&#34;hide this filth&#34;]]
Greetings from the Internet Outreach team, skippers!

We are running an art contest! In celebration of the ten-year anniversary of our fair community coming to be. Sometimes it&#39;s hard to believe that SCP has really been around for a decade. We&#39;ve certainly accomplished a lot here together. Now, enough talk, time to learn how to follow the rules:

# All varieties of visual art will be acceptable submissions. This includes paintings, drawings, photographs, ms paint scribbles, etc.
# Winners would have their art displayed on corresponding hub pages until January 1st, 2018.
# Art can be posted in this page&#39;s discussion thread, or through a message to one of the social media pages linked in the sidebar. Include the artist&#39;s name and the category they wish to enter the piece in as the file name. All files should be using the. png format. Entries can also be sent to rhusrhadicans@gmail.com.
# like!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;artistnamecategory.png&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;!this
# Content of art must be relevant to the category. The same artwork cannot be submitted into multiple categories.
# Categories will be SCPs from **Series I**, **Series II**, **Series III**, **Series IV**, along with **Characters**, **Mobile Task Forces**, **Groups of Interest**, and **Tales**.
# Art drawn before the start of the contest can be submitted if it was originally posted within 30 days prior to the contest officially beginning. 
# Art must be safe for work, so that it can be displayed on the hub pages. While blood, guts and glory are all part of the SCP universe, they&#39;re not part of this contest.
# The posting period would last between July 30th to August 30th. Following this, the judging period will last between 1-2 months depending on volume of entries.
# Identity of the judges will be kept secret until after the announcement of the winners. Attempts at sucking up to tumblr/deviantArt/facebook/reddit/twitter/tumblr mods may result in disqualification and/or //eternal shame//.
# Images will be displayed with a landscape orientation at the top of the relevant category hub pages. All entries should be submitted using the .png format.
# During the contest, batches of images will be posted to the SCP Foundation social media pages. These selections will not be made by the judges and may or may not correspond with their opinions. All artists will be fully credited in these posts.

+ JUDGING CRITERIA

The judges will be asked to appraise the work through three basic criteria.

* How well does the piece represent what it is depicting?
* Does the piece display originality and imagination?
* Personal aesthetic appraisal of the artwork.

In addition, extra credit will be granted for depicting lesser known works or aspects of the universe.

SOME QUESTIONS AND/OR ANSWERS

+ Q THE STRUCTURE OF THIS CONTEST IS STRANGE AND FRIGHTENS ME

That&#39;s okay I&#39;m sure we can get through this together. Just hold my hand, and take deep breaths...

+ Q I DON&#39;T WANT TO MAKE A SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT

You can also post the art in this thread, and if you really love us you can put the category stuff in a collapsible label along with the file name &lt;3.

+ Q I DON&#39;T WANT TO MAKE A SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT AND I AM ALSO NOT A MEMBER OF THE SITE?

We&#39;d love to take your art, if you can fling it at us through another official channel I&#39;m sure any member of internet outreach would be happy to accept it. As stated above, entries can be submitted to rhusrhadicans@gmail.com.

+ Q BUT I AM NOT GOOD AT DRAW

You might be better than you think. This is also a celebration, we want to share art from all corners of our community. Draw your favorite obscure article and you&#39;ll bring the author a bit of happiness to commemorate a decade of spoops.

+ Q WHAT IF MY ART FEATURES MORE SCPS THAN JUST ONE CATEGORY CAN CONTAIN

We would ask that you make the primary subject of your piece depict one SCP, character, or what-have-you. There can certainly be any number of SCPs or other universe elements featured in the artwork, as long as it primarily features a subject relevant to the category.

So in brief, each piece of art should be entered into one category and primarily depict something from that category.

+ Q DO I NEED TO BE CC

Yes, all parts of your entry must be compliant with the site license as detailed in our [[[Licensing Guide]]].

+ Q HOW MANY ENTRIES CAN I POST???

How many can you draw? ;)

+ Q WHEN CAN I POST AGAIN AND ALSO WHERE DO I SEND MY ENTRIES

You can submit it to any of our social media pages, we&#39;ll be collecting them and posting them during the contest and deciding a winner after the end of August. You can post between July and August 30th. Make sure you indicate that you&#39;re entering the piece into the contest and all the other stuff indicated above on this page.
