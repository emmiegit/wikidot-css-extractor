**Special Containment Procedures:** Each instance of SCP-5137 is kept in a separate containment chamber. Living personnel are not to come in contact with SCP-5137 outside of testing. Those that come within close proximity to SCP-5137 are required to adopt a friendly disposition towards the instance.

**Description:** SCP-5137 denotes a number of thaumaturgically animated constructs made out of an intact human epidermis. SCP-5137 instances resemble previously living humans, and consist of the epidermis, hair, and nails of the individual. Their overall body shape remains humanoid in form, regardless of their lack of muscles, bones, and other support structures. Despite lacking the required anatomy, SCP-5137 are capable of locomotion, vocalization, sight and hearing. They possess a rudimentary sentience and a limited vocabulary, most of which revolves around the concept of friendship.

When in close proximity to a living human, SCP-5137 will split down the middle and attempt to envelop the individual. If unobstructed, SCP-5137 will morph in size and coloration until it is indistinguishable from the subject&#39;s actual skin. SCP-5137 refer to this behavior as &#39;hugging&#39;.

However, if the subject shows aversion to SCP-5137, it will detach the subject&#39;s epidermis through unknown means. Brain activity will immediately cease, and the detached epidermis will become a new instance of SCP-5137.

As of writing, the Foundation is in possession of 27 instances of SCP-5137.

**Incident Report 5137-3:** During testing, an instance of SCP-5137 was discovered to have stored the SD card of a handheld camera within the creases of its body. Upon removal of the item, SCP-5137 showed signs of considerable distress. The following are transcripts of the footage stored within the card.

&gt; [START FOOTAGE]
&gt; 
&gt; {//Date on the timestamp reads 05.08.2020. The camera has been placed on a flat surface, facing a bed. A man (hereby referred to as PoI-5137) in his 30s walks into frame and sits on the bed. His appearance is disheveled, and he is sniffling, clearly in emotional distress. He sighs, before beginning to speak.//}
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** So, my therapist told me that I should film myself every day. Just talk to the camera about my thoughts. She said it&#39;ll help clear my head, offer some self-reflection, or something. I don&#39;t know.
&gt; 
&gt; {//He sighs and punches the bed.//}
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** Fuck, this is so stupid. Why am I even doing this?
&gt; 
&gt; [END FOOTAGE]

&gt; [START FOOTAGE]
&gt; 
&gt; {//Date on the timestamp reads 06.08.2020. The man is sitting on the bed with his head in his hands.//}
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** Hi. It&#39;s me again. For the record, I still think this is dumb, but I guess it&#39;s nice to talk every once in a while. So not everything is just inside my head.
&gt; 
&gt; {//He shakes his head and chuckles.//}
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** Man, how sad am I? The only thing I can talk to is a camera. Especially now that Tom&#39;s gone, I have no human interaction anymore. Sure there&#39;s Dr. Ashwood, but she only talks to me because I pay her.
&gt; 
&gt; {//Pause.//}
&gt; 
&gt; I miss Tom. I really do. I don&#39;t know why he put up with me for as long as he did to be honest. Shit, maybe that&#39;s why his heart gave out. Maybe I&#39;m the reason that he&#39;s dead.
&gt; 
&gt; {//Pause.//}
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;m so alone.
&gt; 
&gt; [END FOOTAGE]

&gt; [START FOOTAGE]
&gt; 
&gt; {//Date on the timestamp reads 07.08.2020. This time the man is sitting at a table, leaning towards the camera, which has been set on the table. In front of him is an old book with a black, leathery cover. The man opens his mouth, as if about to say something, and then closes it. This repeats for a while.//}
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** So... I might be going insane. More insane than I already am, that is. But anyway, I think I know how to bring Tom back... And I know how absolutely bonkers mad that sounds, but hear me out. Walking home from the grocery store, I fell down a sinkhole. And like Alice tumbling all the way to Wonderland, I fell out... somewhere else. A library. A huge library, bigger than any structure I have ever seen before. It was so tall, that you could fit skyscrapers inside of it. And it was teeming with... I guess people, but not normal people. Not human people. No, there were all kinds of weird, terrifying creatures of different shapes and sizes. It was like the Mos Eisley cantina scene!
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously, I was terrified, screaming and scrambling all over the place, but then this well dressed dude, another human, with an eye tattooed on his forehead, came up to me and calmed me down. He said his name was [[[http://www.scpwiki.com/uncertaintycrossing-s-art-page |Basar]]], and that I was safe.
&gt; 
&gt; He told that we were in the &#34;Wanderer&#39;s Library&#34;, an infinite library that functions as a hub between dimensions. Can you believe that? It&#39;s insane! He assured me that nothing there was allowed to hurt me. That the Library enforces pacifism. Then, after telling me the basics, about the Librarians, the rules, how loaning works, etc, he then just kind of... shuffled off.
&gt; 
&gt; I was still really overwhelmed, but the curiosity got the best of me, and I started perusing the shelves. I... must have spent hours there. You wouldn&#39;t believe all the things I learnt. I also found... this.
&gt; 
&gt; {//The man lifts the book up and shows it to the camera. The cover reads &#34;Engrams of the Dead&#34;.//}
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** I got myself a library card and loaned this. It&#39;s a book on necromancy. Most of the things here are... complex and dangerous, but there&#39;s one ritual that seems easy enough. &#34;Crafting and Awakening of A Skin Construct&#34;.
&gt; 
&gt; {//The man looks at the camera and smiles. His eyes are welling up.//}
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** I can bring Tom back.
&gt;

&gt; [START FOOTAGE]
&gt; 
&gt; {//Date on the timestamp reads 08.08.2020. The camera appears to be on a tripod in a living room. Furniture has been moved to the sides to make more room in the middle, where the corpse of an adult human lays atop an intricate, thaumaturgic sigil. Lit candles are positioned on the edges of the sigil.//}
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** I went and dug Tom up. Poor bastard must have been cold down there, in the dirt. It&#39;s okay though, that&#39;s over now. Well, almost over. First we need to get him on his feet again! Then everything will be fine again. Neither of us will have to be alone anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; {//The man kneels down next to the body, and begins flaying it with a knife.//}
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** Just hang in there, Tom. It won&#39;t be too long now.
&gt; 
&gt; {//Removal of the corpse&#39;s epidermis takes several hours. Extraneous dialogue has been omitted. Upon completion of the task, the man drags the skinless body out of frame and arranges the skin in the middle of the sigil. He then moves behind it and begins chanting in an unknown language. After several minutes, the sigil flashes, and the candles are extinguished as their flames are sucked into the skin, which then animates, getting on all fours and turning towards the man.//}
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** Tom! It actually worked! Oh my god, it actually worked! Welcome back! How are you feeling?
&gt; 
&gt; {//Pause.//}
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** Oh, right. It says that I need to state your purpose. I... I need you to be my friend so I won&#39;t be alone anymore. Like before. Does that sound good?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5137-1:** (//In an exaggeratedly cheerful tone//) Friend... Yes! I will be friend. I will not let you be alone. This is my purpose.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** Great! Let&#39;s go eat. I made you your favorite food as a welcome back gift.

&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** I have now spent an entire day with Tom and we&#39;ve been having tons of fun! Playing video games, cooking, and just shooting the shit. Like in the old times! It&#39;s like nothing has changed.
&gt; 
&gt; {//SCP-5137-1&#39;s face buckles inwards.//}
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** I even cancelled my appointments with Dr. Ashwood. I don&#39;t need her anymore, I have Tom now. I do wish we could go outside though. I miss our hiking trips. Actually, hmm, maybe we could go hiking somewhere really remote. Would that be fun Tom?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5137-1:** I will go anywhere with my friend!
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** Yeah! Let&#39;s do that next weekend. For now though, I&#39;m really tired, so we gotta sleep.
&gt; 
&gt; {//The man appears to forget to turn off the camera as he prepares to sleep. SCP-5137-1 splits down the middle and envelops him, altering its shape until it is unperceivable aside from occasional shifting. The man caresses SCP-5137-1 as he goes to sleep.//}
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** It&#39;s good to have you back.
&gt; 
&gt; {//After a while, the man falls asleep. As he does so, SCP-5137-1 detaches from him. It crawls up the wall, on to the ceiling and then out of the bedroom window.//}

&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** Where... where did that come from?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5137-1:** I brought you another friend!
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** What? How? And why?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5137-1:** I don&#39;t want you to be alone, so I went out when you were sleeping and made a new friend!
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5137-2:** You should never be alone.
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5137-1:** And you never will!
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** What? No, this isn&#39;t... this shouldn&#39;t be possible. How did you make him, Tom? Who is he?
&gt; 
&gt; {//The sound of a doorbell is audible.//}
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** Both of you, hide. We will continue this later.
&gt; 
&gt; {//Both SCP-5137 instances scamper into cupboards. The man holds the camera down as he walks to the front door and opens. The legs of an elderly woman become visible.//}
&gt; 
&gt; **Unknown Woman:** Hi... sorry to bother you, but have you seen my husband Gerry lately? He didn&#39;t come home last night, and he isn&#39;t answering his phone. I&#39;m getting a bit worried, so I&#39;m going down the neighborhood in hopes that someone would know where he is.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** N-no! I... I haven&#39;t seen him.
&gt; 
&gt; **Unknown Woman:** Are you okay, young man? You seem a bit distraught.
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** No, everything&#39;s fine. I just... I just lost a friend recently.
&gt; 
&gt; **Unknown Woman:** Oh, sorry to hear that. Well uh, if you hear anything or if you see Gerry, would you be so kind as to come and tell me?
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** I will. I uh, I hope you find him.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5137-1:** But... you need friends!
&gt; 
&gt; {//SCP-5137-2 frowns.//}
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-5137-2:** Do you not like me? I can be a good friend... Do you need me to give you a hug, so you can see how good of a friend I can be?
&gt; 
&gt; {//SCP-5137-2 stands up and splits down the middle. Thaumaturgic energy begins coursing through its innards, as it slowly walks towards the man.//}
&gt; 
&gt; **PoI-5137:** No! No! I mean... no, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m... just having a migraine. That&#39;s why I lashed out. It wasn&#39;t anything you did.
