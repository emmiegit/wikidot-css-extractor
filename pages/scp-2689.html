[[include component:image-block name=marlboro.png|caption=Packet of SCP-2689 instances.|width=220px]]
**Item #:** SCP-2689

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-2689 are to be kept inside a cabinet humidor at [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-77 |Site-77]]].

**Description:** SCP-2689 is the collective term for eight thousand four hundred (8400) tobacco cigarettes, packaged in boxes containing twenty cigarettes each. Instances of SCP-2689 resemble non-anomalous Marlboro Blend No. 27 cigarettes in terms of appearance and composition. The cigarette packet also appears to be identical, excluding a design inconsistency in the form of a printed message reading:

GURGLING DOWN SHIT? **REAL MEN** GURGLE DOWN THE //SMOOTH, RICH TASTE// OF A **MARLBORO™** CIGARETTE!

AN UNFILTERED FLAVOR FOR AN UNFILTERED MOUTH.

BROUGHT TO YOU BY **MARLBORO™** 
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH **MOTHERS AGAINST MARLBORO™**[[footnote]]A non-profit organization that advocates for the restriction and regulation of tobacco products, especially Marlboro products. This group has never been involved in the advertisement and marketing of Marlboro products.[[/footnote]]

SCP-2689&#39;s anomalous effects manifest when an individual protrudes their tongue and presses into the cigarette&#39;s filter[[footnote]]A component in cigarettes used to absorb tobacco residue. In most Marlboro cigarettes, it is indicated by an orange-colored section.[[/footnote]]. The cellulose acetate fiber inside the filter dissolves upon contact with saliva, leading into a spatially anomalous extension of the filter&#39;s paper tube. As the tongue enters the tube, it shrinks and deforms to accommodate for the filter&#39;s diameter. When the full length of the individual&#39;s tongue is inside SCP-2689, stimulation of their genioglossus muscles[[footnote]]A pair of extrinsic muscles responsible for the extension of the tongue.[[/footnote]] causes the tongue to gain additional mass and extend further into the tube. Conversely, stimulation of their hyoglossus muscles[[footnote]]A pair of extrinsic muscles responsible for the retraction and depression of the tongue.[[/footnote]] gradually reverses these effects, allowing the retraction of the tongue from SCP-2689. During this process, subjects report feeling mild discomfort and the sensation of a &#34;bitter, viscous substance&#34; accumulating around their tongue. 

After 15 minutes of continued muscular growth, subjects report feeling their tongue emerging from the tube and making contact with a &#34;slimy, fleshy hole.&#34; This is shortly followed by painful sensations of their tongue being crushed or severed by a hard object, though this does not occur all the time. Uncommonly, subjects will instead experience their tongue &#34;falling down&#34; on a surface of variable composition. Samples collected from the subject after these excursions include concrete particles, detritus, and cigar ash.

**Addendum 01:** All currently contained SCP-2689 instances were initially discovered in a shipment sent to the Phillip Morris USA headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. Multiple middle-aged female subjects were witnessed transporting the shipment into the building&#39;s lobby via hand truck. Upon questioning, the subjects described its contents as &#34;unfiltered cigarettes with a flavor you can really suck down on.&#34; Retrieval agents seized the package after the object&#39;s anomalous properties were discussed in the company&#39;s intranet. The female subjects involved in this incident have been unable to be identified.

**Addendum 02:** On March 8, 2017, a lodger at a Holiday Inn hotel in Kamloops, Canada called the police, reporting a &#34;tentacle&#34; emerging from his cigarette and &#34;deep throating [him.]&#34; Foundation agents embedded in the Kamloops RCMP arrived at the scene and confiscated the offending materials. Analysis of the severed appendage revealed that it belonged to D-7332, who was participating in SCP-2689 testing at the time. Testing has been temporarily suspended in light of this incident.
