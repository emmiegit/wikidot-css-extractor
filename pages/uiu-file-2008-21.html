[[tab Event/Locale Preface]]

**Event Discovery:** A sudden out of season blizzard was detected by meteorological equipment in Portland Recon Camp Bravo. Further information revealed the blizzard to be localized to Boring, Oregon, a city 20 miles from Portland. Strike Team Bravo-01 was dispatched to investigate the unusuality. 

**Locale Summary (Pre-Event):** Transdimensional Hotspot US-1221, AKA Boring, Oregon, is a convergence of transdimensional waypoints with a US citizen community. The local population regards supernatural events as normal. Area is under SCP Foundation supervision. 

An organization dedicated to the capture and rehabilitation of supernatural fauna by the name of &#39;Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Shelter&#39; is based out of THUS-1221. 

**Locale Summary (Post-Event):** Boring suffered intense snowfall, which quickly melted following the stabilization of weather patterns. Minor flooding persisted for a week following. Efforts to rebuild the Wilson Center and provide disaster relief to Boring are ongoing.

Wilson&#39;s Wildlife Shelter is now an affiliate of the SCP Foundation. As per the Boring Agreement, the United States government maintains a joint jurisdiction of the area alongside the SCP Foundation and affiliated parties.

**Purpose/Motive:** Unknown/Survival

**Modus Operandi:** Creature wandered aimlessly through Boring while scavenging for food. 

**Behavior:** The creature was highly hostile to UIU agents and WWS members alike. It avoided areas with large civilian populations and overturned a dumpster.

&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Masters:** Yes, Mister Wilson this is being recorded. You aren&#39;t in trouble, you haven&#39;t broken any laws, I just want to talk to you about this situation.
&gt; 
&gt; **Wilson:** Listen, I appreciate all the help the government has given us here but... 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Masters:** I promise you Sarah will be okay. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Wilson:** Old Al was almost mauled by the polar bear, my center is in ruins, and... gosh, I don&#39;t even want to think about Copper.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Masters:** I am aware of what has transpired, Mister Wilson. Will you please cooperate with me?
&gt; 
&gt; **Wilson:** Fine... But let&#39;s be quick about it, please. I need to rally the troops and I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m gonna talk them out of this one...
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Masters:** How long was the bear in your custody? 
&gt; 
&gt; **Wilson:** About a week now I reckon.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Masters:** How did you house the bear prior?
&gt; 
&gt; **Wilson:** We tried keeping it in one those big ol&#39; enclosures you see over there, but it didn&#39;t pan out well. So instead we kept up in that Neptune Cold Storage down by main street, but... Well, you already saw what happened there.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Masters:** How are you able to afford all this?
&gt; 
&gt; **Wilson:** Are you... are you accusing me of something?
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Masters:** No, I would never. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Wilson:** We get all our money and fixin&#39;s off of donations and bake sales. We got a real big anonymous donor. They&#39;re our guardian angel, I&#39;m telling you. But I don&#39;t know if this going to be able to pay for Sarah&#39;s hospital bill. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Masters:** Do you have an-
&gt; 
&gt; **Wilson:** I just feel so bad is all, she was just doing her job, pro bono no less, and lending us a hand with that dangerous critter and... Gosh. Are you sure I can&#39;t see her? I just want to talk to her and let her know we&#39;re going to cover her expenses. I think I might have to take out another loan, but it&#39;ll be a-okay.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Masters:** Mister Wilson, please. Do you suspect anyone of being this angel donor?
&gt; 
&gt; **Wilson:** I don&#39;t know! The donations are anonymous. Now look, mister, it&#39;s been real nice but I&#39;m getting antsy and my folks out there are shaking in their boots, not just &#39;cause of the cold. I need to go talk to them and tell them this is all going to be a-okay.
&gt; 
&gt; **Agent Masters:** Very well. Thank you, Mister Wilson.
&gt; 
&gt; //Note: Mister Wilson was looking quite distressed during our conversation. No eye contact, a smile from ear to ear, and he was wheezing the whole time. He doesn&#39;t seem like the dishonest kind, and his criminal record came up clean. I suspect he might just fear authority figures.//

[[tab Bureau Record]]

**Current Status of Investigation:** Creature&#39;s remains are in FBI custody. Disaster relief has been deployed to Boring, Oregon and a cover story of a freak summer cold front caused by global warming has been disseminated.
