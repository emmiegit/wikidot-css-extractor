**Item #:** SCP-7377

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7377 must be contained within a plastic Planters container of dry roasted peanuts. The jar must contain exactly 540 whole (not halved) dry roasted peanuts. The nutritional data must be removed.

**Description:** SCP-7377 is a 6.56mm x 2.2mm grain of white rice.

------


&gt; //News report August 10, 2002 of the first believed contact with SCP-7377.//
&gt; 
&gt; //**Reporter:**// We go out and buy snacks for ourselves every week, but have you ever wondered what could be lurking in a snack’s packaging? Mrs. Larson found out first had what might be waiting for you if you aren’t careful putting a hand full of peanuts in your mouth.
&gt; 
&gt; //**Mrs. Larson:**// I felt a sharp pain in my tooth. Yeah, I didn’t even notice it.
&gt; 
&gt; //**Reporter:**// Mrs. Larson purchased a jar of peanuts, a simple snack that many Americans buy every day. Little did she know that lurking in her jar of peanuts was a grain of uncooked rice.
&gt; 
&gt; //**Mrs. Larson:**// Yeah, I-uhh, I didn’t really even think that there might be [laughs] some rice with my peanuts.
&gt; 
&gt; //**Reporter:**// Mrs. Larson purchased a jar of Planters lightly salted peanuts wanting a snack for  her afternoon shows, but found a fractured tooth instead. We spoke with Planters’ consumer representative, Matthew Armand, who had this to say:
&gt; 
&gt; //**Matthew Armand:**// We-uh, we have never had this happen before. We don’t even package rice at our factory. We are-uh looking into how it could have happened. As is right now, we aren’t sure if it was an accident or deliberate.
&gt; 
&gt; //**Reporter:**// What do you have to say to all your consumers?
&gt; 
&gt; //**Matthew Armand:**// We can assure you that our peanut packaging factories don’t have contact with rice. You shouldn’t be concerned about finding rice in your peanuts.


&gt; //News report August 13, 2002 of SCP-7377’s affected containers//
&gt; 
&gt; //**Reporter:**// Rice. We have it with our meals all the time, but what does it have to do with peanuts?
&gt; 
&gt; //**Mr. Lampert:**// It was stuck in between the peanuts. I didn’t even expect it and now I have a fractured tooth.
&gt; 
&gt; //**Reporter:**// Thomas Lampert, yet another victim of rogue rice in their peanut jars.
&gt; 
&gt; //**Mr. Lampert:**// I mean— I’m old. My teeth aren’t very strong. Something like this could really hurt some people.
&gt; 
&gt; //**Reporter:**// Thomas Lampert felt a sharp pain in his molar and quickly discovered that a piece of uncooked rice had made its way into his jar of peanuts.
&gt; 
&gt; //**Mr. Lampert:**// We bought two-uh. Two-uh things of peanuts. I opened up them both and I found another piece of rice in the second one.
&gt; 
&gt; //**Reporter:**// This isn’t the first time. Two days ago we spoke with Mrs. Larson, who had a similar story.
&gt; 
&gt; //**Mrs. Larson:**// Yeah, I-uhh, I didn’t really even think that there might be [laughs] some rice with my peanuts.
&gt; 
&gt; //**Reporter:**// We spoke with Matthew Armand, Planters’ consumer representative, again to talk about the rice with his peanuts.
&gt; 
&gt; //**Matthew Armand:**// We are still investigating why there’s rice showing up in everybody’s peanuts.
&gt; 
&gt; //**Reporter:**// Could this be some kind of joke?
&gt; 
&gt; //**Matthew Armand:**// As much as I’d hate to admit it; yes. It’s starting to look like someone— someone, somehow—got rice into our product. We are screening everybody who could have had access to our containers before they’re sealed or when our peanuts are being shelled. We’re going to get this taken care of. We’re recalling our shipments and we’re going to take care of this.
&gt; 
&gt; //**Reporter:**// Mr. Larson is lucky. Of anything that could be put into our food, rice is not the worst thing you can find.




&gt; **Test Log #1**
&gt; Hello, I am Dr. Amil Asom, research director of SCP-7377. 
&gt; We have a great deal of tests to run on SCP-7377 with regards to both itself and it’s chosen container. We need to eliminate variables and turn them into absolute facts. SCP-7377 has gone unnoticed by consumers due to it’s benign nature; and, yes, we are currently hopeful that is indeed benign.
&gt; 
&gt; We are going to begin by varying the number of peanuts within SCP-7377’s container and see how it contrasts with the number of affected containers.   

&gt; **Test Log #2**
&gt; Hello, I am Dr. Amil Asom, research director of SCP-7377. 
&gt; After our tests, we have come to the conclusion that SCP-7377 tends to decrease the number of affected containers while sealed with a number of peanuts between 400 and 800. The affected containers seems to hover around 44 - 56%, increasing drastically to 9233% and beyond once contained with over 801 peanuts. We are going to continue to vary the number of peanuts until we arrive at a specific number. We are still hopeful of SCP-7377’s benign nature.

&gt; **Test Log #3**
&gt; Hello, I am Dr. Amil Asom, research director of SCP-7377.
&gt; Our tests on the number of peanuts have, through belabored data tracking and peanut variation, arrived at our desired quantity. SCP-7377 seems to affect only 26% of containers, while stored within a container of exactly 540 whole peanuts. Through a great debate, we agreed that a peanut should not be defined as a peanut half and instead by a peanut whole. SCP-7377 seems to prefer peanut wholes. We tested unshelled peanuts, but SCP-7377 seems hate the idea of unshelled peanuts and I suppose I don’t blame it. Yes, that was my attempt at humor. SCP-7377 increased the number of affected containers to over 22,000% with the introduction of just a single unshelled peanut, which was the largest spike we’ve ever had so far.
&gt; Our next two variables to define are flavor of peanut and brand container.

&gt; **Test Log #4**
&gt; Hello, I am Dr. Amil Asom, research director of SCP-7377.
&gt; Our tests on flavor of peanut did not vary the percentage of affected containers by much, but we found that dry roasted decreases it by around 0.8%. Brand container, however, seems to matter a lot. Whitley’s and Munchies containers resulted in massive spikes. Our initial Planters container seems to have been our winner the whole time. We are going to try and alter the container shape to others of the Planters brand and mess with the many variable ways of storing the container with our next series of tests.

&gt; **Test Log #5**
&gt; Hello, I am Dr. Amil Asom, research director of SCP-7377.
&gt; We have discovered that SCP-7377 does not seem to like the nutritional label. Perhaps it’s watching it’s saturated fats. Yes, that was more of my infamous humor. After removing the label, we have effectively decreased the total number of affected containers down to negligible amounts. We are going to consider SCP-7377 contained at this point. The number of years we would need to devote to eliminating every last variable is simply unreasonable to ask of mere mortal researchers.
