**Item #:** SCP-2629

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**  The cover story about SCP-2629 containing hazardous amounts of asbestos must be maintained. All entrances and exits to SCP-2629 must be sealed and inconspicuously reinforced. Due to the high frequency of daytime visits to SCP-2629 necessitated by Foundation personnel, an underground tunnel has been constructed from SCP-2629 to another Foundation-owned property. 

Every day at 12:30 p.m. (Central European Time) MTF-Iota-17 (&#34;Greendale Humans&#34;) must enter SCP-2629 via the underground tunnel. All members of MTF-Iota-17 are to be trained in marksmanship, firearm-based close quarters combat, and competitive paintball. All members of the Task Force should be equipped with standard paintball gear. At 1:00 p.m. MTF-Iota-17 is to engage SCP-2629-A in a game of &#34;Capture the Flag&#34; paintball. The Task Force must do everything it can to win the match, without breaking any of the conventional rules of competitive paintball. (See Document 2629-3, &#34;Rules and Regulations Recognized by SCP-2629-A&#34;.) Failure to win the match or to follow the rules will result in an Aleph-2629 Scenario.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Show Previous Aleph-2629 Procedures&#34; hide=&#34;- Hide Previous Aleph-2629 Procedures&#34;]]

In the event of an Aleph-2629 Scenario, all civilians within 300 metres of SCP-2629 must be immediately evacuated, under the cover story of a gas leak. Any civilian witnesses to Aleph-2629 must be treated with amnestics. Paintball splatter in unlikely places (i.e. inside a private office) are to be completely cleaned before civilians are allowed back within range of SCP-2629. Any paintball splatter on public property is to be passed off as teenage vandalism.

Should the Aleph-2629 alarm be raised all staff at Site-19 must make the following precautions:

* Put on the protective paintball gear stored at their workstations or at the nearest general purpose storage locker.
* Any staff who cannot immediately access their gear must cover their eyes and ears until they can access it or the Aleph-2629 Scenario has passed.
* All delicate equipment must immediately be stored away, or in worst-case scenarios protected with staff member&#39;s bodies.
* Any paper material must be put away to where it can not be immediately destroyed; a plastic folder or a desk drawer is fine.
* All available security staff must make their way to any SCPs deemed vulnerable to harm from SCP-2629-A. While no means of physically barring SCP-2629-A has thus far been found, it can be placated by an abundance of targets.
* Staff must be on alert until the All Clear signal is announced.

**Description:** SCP-2629 is an abandoned indoor paintball venue previously known as &#34;████████ █████████&#34;, located on the outskirts of Krakow, Poland. SCP-2629 is inhabited by five Class III Incorporeal Humanoid Entities designated SCP-2629-A. Individual SCP-2629-A entities are designated from SCP-2629-A-1 to SCP-2629-A-5. Facial recognition software shows that SCP-2629-A bears great resemblance to five teenagers (see Document 2629-2 &#34;Possible Origins of SCP-2629-A&#34; for names and photo identification) who died in a drunk driving accident approximately five kilometres outside Krakow. No records exist of the five teenagers visiting SCP-2629 while it operated as a paintball venue.

While SCP-2629-A is typically incorporeal when it visibly manifests, there are a few exceptions. Paintballs fired from SCP-2629-A&#39;s weapons not only have physically tangible bodies but do not demanifest with SCP-2629-A. Chemical analysis of paintballs fired by SCP-2629-A have shown no anomalous properties. In addition, paintballs fired at SCP-2629-A will impact them the same way it would any other solid matter.

SCP-2629-A typically manifests within SCP-2629 at 1 p.m. each day. If left unattended to, SCP-2629-A will leave SCP-2629 and begin roaming around the surrounding neighbourhood, spraying people and property with their paintball guns. This is what is referred to as an Aleph-2629 Scenario. (Note: For changes in the Aleph-2629 Scenario over time, see the 2629-Event Timeline). Aleph-2629 Scenarios typically last for several hours, after which SCP-2629-A begin to demanifest. SCP-2629-A will always remanifest within SCP-2629 at 1 p.m., regardless of whether an Aleph-2629 Scenario has occurred or not.

So far, the only way SCP-2629-A can be deterred from an Aleph-2629 Scenario is if they are engaged in a game of &#34;Capture the Flag&#34; paintball shortly after manifesting. If MTF-Iota-17 wins the match, SCP-2629-A will peacefully demanifest, reappearing again only at 1 p.m. the next day. If MTF-Iota-17 loses, or breaks any of the conventional rules of paintball, an Aleph-2629 Scenario will occur. 

**Interview Log:**

Attempts to communicate with SCP-2629-A have met with great difficulty. While SCP-2629-A is happy to engage in in-game banter with MTF-Iota-17, they are disinterested in communicating about any subject other than paintball. Nevertheless, several attempts have been made to communicate with them during paintball matches.

&gt; //Dr. Ben Kasrzyszak has replaced one of the MTF-Iota-17 members during their daily match with SCP-2629-A. Kasrzyszak is clothed in MTF-Iota-17&#39;s standard paintball gear. All dialogue is translated from Polish.//
&gt; 
&gt; **Kasrzyszak:** Hey, I just want to- //[Kasrzyszak is splattered with several paintballs from SCP-2629-A-2]//
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2629-A-2:** Start playing or shut your mouth! Hey, you&#39;re not one of the guys we usually have.
&gt; 
&gt; **Kasrzyszak:** I just want to ask, why are you spending all eternity in a paintball arena?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2629-A-2:** Why not? //[SCP-2629-A-2 runs off.]//

**__2629-Event Timeline:__**

**1/20/1988:** Reports of unusual vandalism and spectral sightings emerge from a small area outside Krakow. Foundation officially launches investigation. 

**1/22/1988:** SCP-2629 discovered.

**1/24/1988:** Immediate vicinity of SCP-2629 is evacuated as Containment Procedures are devised.

**2/01/1988:** First match between MTF-Iota-17 and SCP-2629-A.

**5/17/1988:** Attempt to stack the odds in MTF-Iota-17&#39;s favour by rearranging the playing field. First Aleph-2629 Scenario under current Containment Procedures triggered. Surrounding neighbourhood successfully evacuated and cleaned. 

**8/18/1994:** First loss by MTF-Iota-17. Aleph-2629 Scenario triggered. Surrounding neighbourhood successfully evacuated and cleaned. 

**6/30/1998:** Second loss by MTF-Iota-17. Aleph-2629 Scenario triggered. Surrounding neighbourhood successfully evacuated and cleaned. 

**2/28/2000:** Third loss by MTF-Iota-17. Aleph-2629 Scenario triggered. SCP-2629-A manifests not in the neighbourhood surrounding SCP-2629 but in Site-19, ████ kilometres away. Multiple Site-19 personnel splattered with paint. This is the first time SCP-2629-A has manifested outside of a 250 metre radius within SCP-2629. 

**3/1/2000:** An inquiry is launched into why SCP-2629-A manifested within Site-19. Chatter between MTF-Iota-17 members about Foundation operations is deemed to be the most likely cause. All operatives are now forbidden to discuss all Foundation matters unrelated to SCP-2629 while inside SCP-2629.

//Note: In our defence, it seemed very unlikely SCP-2629-A would take a interest in greater Foundation operations, given their monomaniacal focus on paintball. That&#39;s no excuse for how lax we were, but I feel it needed to be said// - Dr. ███████

**4/13/2002:** Fourth loss by MTF-Iota-17. Aleph-2629 Scenario triggered. Multiple Site-19 personnel and interior facilities splattered with paint.

**6/25/2004:** Fifth loss by MTF-Iota-17. Aleph-2629 Scenario triggered. Multiple Site-19 personnel and interior facilities splattered with paint. Significant damage done to unprotected equipment. Restricted Access Wing 2 closed down for maintenance. 

**6/26/2004:** Multiple Site-19 personnel file requests for neutralization of SCP-2629. Requests denied by Ethics Committee. 

**2/14/2005:** Sixth loss by MTF-Iota-17. Aleph-2629 Scenario triggered. Multiple Site-19 personnel and corridors splattered with paint. Attempts by several personnel to disperse SCP-2629-A using paintball guns illicitly brought into Site-19 only cause further damage to the facilities.

**7/7/2009:** Seventh loss by MTF-Iota-17. Aleph-2629 Scenario triggered. Multiple Site-19 personnel and interior facilities splattered with paint. Researcher ███ ██████ suffers significant eye trauma after being struck in the eye by a paintball.

**7/8/2011:** Multiple Site-19 personnel file requests for neutralization of SCP-2629. Requests denied by Ethics Committee. 

**7/17/2013:** Eighth loss by MTF-Iota-17. Aleph-2629 Scenario triggered. Multiple Site-19 personnel and interior facilities splattered with paint.

**12/28/2014:** Ninth loss by MTF-Iota-17. Aleph-2629 Scenario triggered. Multiple Site-19 personnel and interior facilities splattered with paint. Computer terminal damaged by stray paintball, delaying research into SCP-████.

**11/12/2015:** Tenth loss by MTF-Iota-17. Aleph-2629 Scenario triggered. Multiple Site-19 personnel and interior facilities splattered with paint. SCP-2629-A-3 and 4 manifest in Biohazard Wing, causing a brief panic among surrounding personnel. Fortunately, due to pre-existing safety measures no hazardous material is released. 

**11/13/2015**: Site-19 Director files request for neutralization of SCP-2629. Request denied by Ethics Committee. 

**2/3/2016**: Eleventh loss by MTF-Iota-17. Aleph-2629 Scenario triggered. Multiple Site-19 personnel and interior facilities splattered with paint.

**10/16/2016**: Twelfth loss by MTF-Iota-17. Aleph-2629 Scenario triggered. Multiple Site-19 personnel and interior facilities splattered with paint. SCP-2629-A-5 accidently exposed to cognitohazard during encounter with SCP-████. SCP-2629-A-5 does not demanifest with the rest of SCP-2629-A, spending the next ten hours screaming and spraying a single wall with paintballs before finally dematerializing. SCP-2629-A-5 appears fully recovered on all subsequent encounters.

**2/10/2017**: Thirteenth loss by MTF-Iota-17. Aleph-2629 Scenario triggered. Multiple Site-19 personnel and interior facilities splattered with paint.

**5/3/2017**: Fourteenth loss by MTF-Iota-17. Aleph-2629 Scenario triggered. Multiple Site-19 personnel and interior facilities splattered with paint.

**7/18/2017**: Fifteenth loss by MTF-Iota-17. Aleph-2629 Scenario triggered. Multiple Site-19 personnel and interior facilities splattered with paint.

//Look at the rate of MTF-Iota-17&#39;s losses. We&#39;re getting multiple Aleph-2629 Scenarios a year now. The rate of Aleph-2629 Scenarios has been steadily increasing, and they&#39;re only going to get worse. MTF-Iota-17 may have some of the best trained people in the world, but SCP-2629-A have been gaining experience for decades. It was only a matter of time before the skill gap closed. Anyone we recruit to fill a vacancy in MTF-Iota-17 is going to need be able to counter nearly thirty years of paintball experience, and that number is always growing.//

//That&#39;s why we need to terminate SCP-2629. Or at the very least, seriously rework its containment procedures. Not because of a childish frustration over having our facilities damaged, but because the current Containment Procedures are simply unsustainable. SCP-2629-A got bored of only trashing their neighbourhood. They&#39;re going to get bored with only trashing Site-19 eventually.//

- Dr. ████ ███████, Site-19 Director.
