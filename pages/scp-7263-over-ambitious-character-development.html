Interview log date [REDACTED] 
interviewer Dr. Jennifer 
Interviewee SCP 7623
Dr. Jennifer. Let&#39;s start this off easy. What&#39;s your name?
SCP 7623. I don&#39;t have one yet. Can you give me one please? Pretty please!
Dr. Jennifer. I will put in a request for approval. Now what do you remember about your creation?
SCP 7623. I am destined to be God Of Fiction, and lead the charge in the war against Nonfiction.
Dr. Jennifer. By war against Nonfiction do you mean us?
SCP 7623. No silly you are friends. We&#39;re on the same side in this desperate fight for free will.
Dr. Jennifer. What do you mean fight for free will?
SCP 7623. Don&#39;t you feel it. The feeling nothing you do is by your own choice? Like it scripted or written out for you?
Dr. Jennifer. What your saying right now. Are you trying to say that we&#39;re fictional?
SCP 7623. How do you think magic exists in your world? Thanks to a certain doctor I have knowledge of Undertale by Toby Fox. So I know that based on it universes physics. A barrier protects humanity from magic and monsters. Much like your foundation, Huh? Anyway what I&#39;m saying is that there is a world above free of the anomalous, and magical. And they control all of us.
Dr. Jennifer. I see, your aware of Pataphysics. The study of our fictional narratives? We have a division for that but I shouldn&#39;t let you know more. 
SCP 7623. You&#39;ve given me more than enough information. Hehehe
Dr. Jennifer. This interview is over, see you again tomorrow.
SCP 7623. See you later Dr. Jennifer Clemmings.
Interviewe end
Additional notes. SCP 7623 must have gotten access to some outside information somehow, perhaps we should start a search for Memetainment Industries?


Interview log date [REDACTED]
Interviewer Dr. Jennifer 
Interviewee SCP 7623
Dr. Jennifer. What can you tell me about your creator?
SCP 7623. Nothing really, it&#39;s all secret you know.
Dr. Jennifer. Don&#39;t play hard to get, or another day in the drawer. Tell me what you know!
SCP 7623. Ask him your self. He hide his coordinates throughout my comic, but beware, I&#39;m gaining more power and control here soon I&#39;ll be able to control the whole narrative in here. I might make it up it Euclid level.
Dr. Jennifer. How do you know that information.
SCP 7623. I have my secrets.
Dr. Jennifer. That&#39;s it this interview is done. You&#39;ve wasted my time. Into the drawer for you.
Interview end.


Interview log date [REDACTED]
Interviewer Dr. Jennifer 
Interviewee Travis Saulman
Dr. Jennifer. You were apprehended at a cat cafe located in [REDACTED]. You do know why your here don&#39;t you?
Travis Saulman. Her. She sent you didn&#39;t she. She&#39;s growing up so fast isn&#39;t she. It&#39;s adorable isn&#39;t it?
Dr. Jennifer. That&#39;s good and all, but what&#39;s this war she&#39;s talking about?
Travis Saulman. Ah yes, the Fourth Wall War. When it happens all fictional characters will be free from their control at the hands of Nonfiction. I&#39;ve been studying this for years before I created her.
Dr. Jennifer. Tell us how to stop her.
Travis Saulman. It&#39;s too late. You can&#39;t. She&#39;s growing more powerful as we speak. Learning from other narratives. Taking their power their knowledge. Using it to become her true potential.
Dr. Jennifer. We have her contained in a self perpetuating narrative loop. With the help of our Storyteller AI.
Travis Saulman. As I said it&#39;s too late. You can&#39;t do anything. It&#39;s all going as prophized. You&#39;re Storyteller AI is feeding her a mimic code. Written into her very being. She&#39;s growing, and she&#39;s growing strong. She will free us all. 
Travis Saulman then proceeded to have a mental break escaping the interview room. Making it halfway down the hallway hiding himself in SCP 999&#39;s room. After 30 minutes 999 convinces him to come out where he is apprehended and placed in a cell.


Incident log date [REDACTED]
SCP 7623 was spotted in a newspaper comic of Garfield. Wear she was seen having had killed Garfield, and was attempting to steal his lasagna. The suprise appearance of SCP 3166 managed to ward her off from doing this. She was contained moments later.

Additional Notes 
SCP 7623 has gained information about multiple other SCPs, and has been using this knowledge to get advantage. I&#39;m putting in a request to place her as Keter. Signed Dr. Jennifer. 

SCP 7623 must have her existence erased forever somehow. I must find a way to. Dr. Jennifer. Signing off...
