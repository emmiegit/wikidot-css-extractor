++++ **NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION**

As SCP-5257&#39;s anomalous abilities only seems to affect the 5257 slot on the SCiP network, the real documentation for 5257 is currently being held on this file, which will serve as a placeholder for the 5257 slot. The real slot is being utilised by the RAISA to host the DIDS. Please do not edit or alter the actual 5257 slot unless you have been instructed to. If you wish to update the documentation regarding SCP-5257, do so on the placeholder slot instead.

For any further questions or concerns, please contact Dir. Andrew Feirin or relevant RAISA administration members. Thank you.

++ **Special Containment Procedures:**

AI Construct &#34;Lyne.aic&#34; is to be monitoring the SCP-5257 slot at all times, and is to frequently report to the RAISA regarding how much the information on the current SCP-5257-X instance has degraded. 

Once degradation levels reach a critical high, the current SCP-5257-X instance is to be fully deleted, and replaced with a new file eligible for deletion. If there are no available files, a random text generator (RTG) can be utilised to create more data for SCP-5257 to consume, however, this is discouraged when eligible files are present.

++++ **Updated on Containment Procedures:**

//15/08/21:// Under the new Data and Infohazard Deletion System (DIDS), all files that have been archived and are considered no longer necessary or are confirmed to be hosting deadly memetic hazards are to be considered eligible for deletion, and used as candidates for SCP-5257-X instances. Files are only to be replaced manually if Lyne.aic stops working or temporarily goes down.

++ **Description:**

SCP-5257 refers to an ongoing anomalous phenomenon related to the 5257 slot on the SCiP database.

When information is uploaded to the 5257 slot, it goes through a process known as SCP-5257-A, in which data uploaded to it slowly &#34;glitches&#34;. This process affects all pieces of digital data uploaded to the slot, including text, images, videos, audio files and computer scripts. SCP-5257-A will continue until all data uploaded to the slot has been fully glitched/corrupted, at which point a second process known as SCP-5257-B will commence. 

During SCP-5257-B, corrupted information will begin being deleted in a seemingly anomalous manner. Looking at the edit history of the slot will also show no traces of info that has been deleted during SCP-5257-B. SCP-5257 is not able to directly affect the data on other slots on database, and SCP-5257-A and -B only occur on the 5257 slot specifically.

As of currently, it is unknown what were to happen if SCP-5257-B were to fully elapse, and if all information on the 5257 slot were to be deleted. 

SCP-5257-X is the general designation for all pages that have been uploaded to the 5257 slot. See Addendum 5257-2 for further details on how new SCP-5257-X instances are to be chosen. The following is a list of examples of the effects on SCP-5257-A on different 5257-X instances:

||~ SCP-5257-X Instance ||~ Description of Data ||~ Effects of SCP-5257-A ||
|| SCP-5257-15 || 1024 by 512 image of SCP-5813-D || As time went on, more and more parts of the image were displayed with the CMYK color model, rather than the RGB color model commonly used for image files. SCP-5257-A elapsed in 9 minutes. Images presumed to take more time to be glitched than text. ||
|| SCP-5257-19 || 2000 words generated by a RTG[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]A random text generator.[[/span]] || Certain words in the text were bolded, while the rest became the same colour as the background, making it impossible to read them unless highlighted. SCP-5257-A elapsed in 14 minutes. The bolded words were combined together, to reveal certain strings of meaningful text.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]This includes what seems to be a multitude of bolded phrases containing the words &#34;Beg&#34;, &#34;Light&#34; and &#34;Please&#34;.[[/span]] ||
|| SCP-5257-23 || A technique-heavy excerpt sourced from an eBook totalling roughly 2500 words || All punctuation symbols within the excerpt reverted to their ASCII codes, presumably due to a fault in HTML encoding. The resultant text was difficult to read through, and alterations of alphanumeric characters were found sporadically throughout the body of writing. Attempts to decipher correlation between altered characters were made by researchers.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Brute forcing different arrangements of the letter anomalies produced one coherent sentence: &#34;Where are they?&#34;[[/span]] SCP-5257-A elapsed in approximately 21 minutes. ||
|| SCP-5257-31 || 3840 by 2160 image of a landscape submitted by Researcher Allan Weryl || Image began experiencing lossy compression and pixel data corruption at a rapid rate. On-duty IT specialists ran a macro that displayed the image&#39;s hex data throughout the process.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Findings returned indicating constant changes being made, presumably at random, throughout the image hex data. Some of these differences did not affect the visual appearance of the image in any sort of way. The image metadata was investigated and a string of text was located under the IIM contact information details, revealing a name. Investigation of this name showed no results in the Foundation&#39;s employee database.[[/span]]  Image gradually experienced further visual disruptions such as resolution changes and eventually full inaccessibility to the image after the file identified as an SVG in a hard-coded manner that could not be reversed. SCP-5257-A elapsed in approximately 35 minutes. ||
|| SCP-5257-35 || An MP3 copy of a recording of Pyotr Tchaikovsky’s Symphony № 5, Movement 4, conducted by the Moscow City Symphony&#39;s &#34;Russian Philharmonic&#34; || Extreme sound data disruptions were present all across the file during many of the runs, including but not limited to: sudden volume and pitch changes, playback speed alterations, completely omitted sections reducing the length of the audio and visible metadata changes causing audio file length to appear as having between 0 and 2,147,483,647 seconds of duration. By the end, the file was incomprehensible and sounded like a rapid frequency fluctuation. However, one iteration of SCP-5257-35 was of interest.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Audio was nigh-indiscernible, though researchers could make out certain distorted noises that were irregular to the sound pattern. A spectrogram reading was taken revealing a barely-readable question in the signal display: “Why won&#39;t you answer?”.[[/span]]  SCP-5257-A elapsed in approximately 35 minutes. ||

++ **Addendum 5257-1: Discovery**

SCP-5257 was first discovered on the 11th of May, 2021, following the expansion of the SCiP database and servers to be able to hold more entries. The 5257 slot was first created on the 8th of May, and it was filled by SCP-5257-D&#39;s now deleted file.

However, 3 days later, technical issues arose on the 5257 slot, prompting RAISA technicians to take a look at it. Shortly after, it was discovered that almost all of the images and audio files on the document were heavily corrupted. This was presumed to be a normal database glitch, and the document was replaced by a new, revised iteration with minor changes to the formatting.

This did not seem to fix the problem, however, as more technical issues arose the following day, and after several tests, it was determined that the slot as a whole seemed to be faulty. Further investigation prompted the RAISA to formally classify SCP-5257 on the 15th of May, 2021, and containment procedures were put into place shortly after once the possible consequences of SCP-5257-A and -B were considered.

++ **Addendum 5257-2: Current Usage of SCP-5257**

On the 29th of May, Spec. Eric Collins made a proposal to the RAISA regarding a new project he designated as the DIDS, or Data and Infohazard Deletion System. The idea was to create an automated system on the database that would feed files pending deletion, or files that hosted cognitohazardous anomalies like info hazards, directly to 5257, without requiring any external assistance.

Spec. Collins justified the usefulness of such a project, by saying that it would not only speed up the deletion of clutter on the database (such as unneeded, archived files that were taking up immense amounts of space on the database servers), but would also make the deletion of info hazards on the site a more efficient and safer process.

&gt; ++++ Proposal-α Regarding SCP-5257 
&gt; +++++ Submitted by Spec. Eric Collins
&gt; +++++ For review by the RAISA

||~ STATUS ||
|| **ACCEPTED** ||
[[/=]]

[[/div]]

Following a majority vote in favour of Collins&#39; proposal, RAISA technicians began working to create the DIDS, a system led by the RAISA&#39;s AI construct, known as Lyne.aic. See Project Proposal Outline 5257-α for further info on how the system functions.

Due to its success, the DIDS is expected to be kept active indefinitely, even with the decrease in undeleted documentation and **other circumstances.** For his work, Spec. Eric Collins was granted the privilege of assisting Dir. Andrew Feirin in leading the project.

The DIDS has been locked to those with Level 4 clearance and above.
