[[include component:image-block name=91st_Street.jpg|caption=View of SCP-2135 entrance from street level]]
**Item #:** SCP-2135

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-2135 is located in a highly trafficked area, isolated containment of SCP-2135 is not feasible at this time. Instead, Foundation agents will work with the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to prevent unauthorized access to SCP-2135 by civilians. SCP-2135 is currently closed to the public and inaccessible by conventional means; as such, this is considered to be a reasonable request that does not require excessive coercion on the part of the Foundation. The interior of SCP-2135 is to be monitored via closed-circuit camera, but as it is plainly visible to civilians travelling within the New York City Subway system, Foundation personnel are discouraged from directly guarding SCP-2135&#39;s interior.

Any incursions into SCP-2135-B are to be conducted by D-Class Personnel under the supervision of Foundation researchers; direct incursion into SCP-2135-B by researchers requires the approval of the current Region 38A (New York City/Long Island) Director. D-Class Personnel entering SCP-2135-B must adhere to the following restrictions: 

* No items manufactured after February 1959 (including clothing, recording equipment, entertainment media, etc) may be taken into SCP-2135-B. 
* When interacting with instances of SCP-2135-C, personnel must avoid using words or phrases that were not commonly used prior to 1959 (e.g. &#34;hippie,&#34; &#34;wicked,&#34; etc). 
* No more than 24 hours may be spent inside of SCP-2135-B. 

**Description:** SCP-2135 is the former 91st Street Station, a station of the New York City Subway system located in Manhattan. Prior to its closure in February 1959, SCP-2135 was served by the 1 and 2 trains of the IRT Broadway - Seventh Avenue Line, bounded by the 96th Street Station to the north and the 86th Street Station to the south. SCP-2135 was closed after platform expansion on the 96th Street Station rendered it impractical to continue servicing it. 

SCP-2135&#39;s anomalous properties manifest twice a week, at unpredictable intervals. During this time, a train  car (which varies by make and model, but is always a car that was in use by the New York City Subway system during or prior to 1959), hereafter SCP-2135-A, will stop at the station for approximately fifteen seconds. SCP-2135-A is only perceivable to those standing on the subway platform at the time it arrives; non-anomalous trains in service will pass through it as if it were not there, and passengers on those trains are unable to perceive SCP-2135-A&#39;s presence as they pass through it. 

Should any subject board the train during this time, they will remain in a state of transit for approximately fifteen minutes, and will be unable to exit the train. No other passengers are present onboard the train, nor is a conductor. After fifteen minutes have elapsed, the train will come to a halt, and subjects will arrive within SCP-2135-B.

SCP-2135-B is a replica of the island of Manhattan as it appeared on 1 Feb 1959. Persons, events, and buildings present in Manhattan during this time are all replicated in a nearly identical fashion within SCP-2135-B, with the following exceptions:

* Persons present inside of Manhattan during this time are replaced by instances of SCP-2135-C (see below).
* All written material present inside of SCP-2135-B, including advertisements, books, newspapers, etc. consist solely of the words &#34;SAFE WORLD&#34; repeated over and over, in capital letters. The exceptions to this are the signs carried by SCP-2135-C. 
* Subway stations other than the 91st Street Station are inaccessible to all subjects. Instead, an instance of SCP-2135-C guards each subway station entrance, remaining still while holding a sign with the word &#34;SECURITY&#34; written on it. Subjects attempting to enter these stations will be forcefully impeded from doing so by the SCP-2135-C instance. 
* Any area beyond the island of Manhattan is rendered inaccessible by a white void surrounding the entire island. Subjects attempting to leave Manhattan will be blocked by an impermeable barrier. SCP-2135-C instances leaving Manhattan will appear to vanish into the void; likewise, SCP-2135-C instances entering Manhattan appear to spontaneously emerge from it. 
* Subjects universally report perceiving SCP-2135-B as monochromatic. 

SCP-2135-C are faceless humanoid entities that inhabit SCP-2135-B. SCP-2135-C instances lack eyes, noses, and mouths, but otherwise are replicas of people that were in Manhattan on 1 Feb 1959. All SCP-2135-C instances carry with them a blank white canvas board and a marker; if in a car or other vehicle, they will have one within close proximity of them. Despite their lack of facial features, SCP-2135-C instances appear capable of sight and scent, and can interact with subjects if prompted via the blank canvas boards, albeit only one or two words at a time (see interview log below). 

Should a subject enter SCP-2135-B with any items that were manufactured after February 1959, or exhibit speech patterns or other mannerisms anachronistic to the period upon exiting the 91st Street Station, SCP-2135-C instances will stop in place and continuously &#34;stare&#34; at the subject until they leave. While SCP-2135-C instances do not exhibit any hostile intent, subjects will generally express a strong desire to leave if SCP-2135-C instances enter this state, citing discomfort and unease. Subjects may leave SCP-2135-B by returning down the 91st Street Station entrance; SCP-2135-A will appear within ten minutes and will return the subject to baseline reality. 

After twenty four hours have passed within SCP-2135-B[[footnote]]91st Street Station was closed on 2 Feb 1959, as it is within SCP-2135-B.[[/footnote]], the 91st Street Station will be closed, and subjects will be unable to leave SCP-2135-B. [REDACTED] although said reports remain unconfirmed, and the similarities may be superficial or coincidental. 

[[collapsible show=&#34;SCP-2135-C Interview Log&#34; hide=&#34;Clearance Accepted&#34;]]
&gt; **Date:** 23 Aug 2007 (baseline time)
&gt; 
&gt; **Test Subject:** D-3425 (29 years old; Caucasian female)
&gt; 
&gt; **Equipment Outfitted:** Handheld audio recorder, c. 1956; period-appropriate clothing; notepad and two (2) pencils, both manufactured c. 1958. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Notes:** To avoid shocking or upsetting D-3425 (thus potentially making data collection problematic), subject was informed of the nature of SCP-2135-B beforehand. Subject is instructed to find nearest SCP-2135-C instance and engage it in conversation, taking care to avoid using contemporary jargon, and transcribe the responses produced via the canvas board. Subject was given a list of pre-approved questions, but was given permission to deviate from this list if necessary. 
 

&gt; //[D-3425 exits 91st Street Station into SCP-2135-B. After several moments, she approaches an instance of SCP-2135-C resembling a caucasian female in her mid to late 30s.]//
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3425:** Umm, hello?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2135-C Instance** //[via canvas board and marker]//: QUERY?[[footnote]]Subsequent tests have revealed that all SCP-2135-C instances begin conversations with the word &#34;QUERY&#34;.[[/footnote]]
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3425:** What exactly is this place?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2135-C Instance**: SAFE WORLD. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3425:** Umm, OK. //[flips through list of questions]// Why is this place here? Who made it? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2135-C Instance**: PROTECTION. PROTECTOR. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3425:** But why did you need to be protected? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2135-C Instance:** ESCAPE GONE. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3425:** What do you mean by &#34;escape&#34;? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2135-C Instance:** ESCAPE. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3425**: But what are you trying to escape from, exactly?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2135-C Instance**: LIGHT WORLD. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3425**: What&#39;s the light world?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2135-C Instance**: YOUR WORLD. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3425**: Why do you need to escape, or get into or whatever, our world? 
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2135-C Instance**: BALANCE. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3425**: OK...umm...why do you allow us into your world?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2135-C Instance**: PRACTICE. 
&gt; 
&gt; **D-3425**: Practice for what?
&gt; 
&gt; **SCP-2135-C Instance**: RESET.
&gt; 
&gt; //[SCP-2135-C instance refuses to respond to any further queries; other instances also refuse to communicate with D-3425. D-3425 enters 91st Street Station and returns to baseline.]//
