**Introduction:**
Here at the Department of Public Disinformation (DPD), we have to deal with keeping things in the public eye seeming as normal as possible, so we have compiled a list of standard cover stories for use with anomalies that cannot be moved from their current locations, for example, [[[SCP-901]]], sites with fronts in urban areas, one time anomalous events and large scale task forces being deployed in public areas.
