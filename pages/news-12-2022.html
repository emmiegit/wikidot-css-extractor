The annual survey has come to a close and our Data Analysis team is working hard to compile the results. The finished product should be ready by December 30th. While we  wait, please enjoy this new edition of Site News featuring some new faces and new content! In one corner, we have an interview with the prolific wiki writer, HarryBlank, who happens to be the recent winner of the 7K contest. In the other, we have a brand new section for article reviews with a fun character-driven article to start off with. 

The Community Outreach team has a lot planned for this year coming year, so stay tuned! Who knows, maybe a contest is lurking around the corner. ;)

++ Front Page Followup
[[/=]]

One of the first things anyone will see when first diving into the SCP Wiki is likely going to be the front landing page featuring the big “CLASSIFIED” at the top, the featured article to the right, and the navigation bar to the left. This page is a staple of our community. However, it was created more than a decade ago, and we are not the same community as we were back in the late 2000s. As such, staff decided that they would like to redesign our front page.

There were a few things to fix with this potential redesign of the site’s landing page. First, despite having been created during the first days of the site, the front page has undergone multiple changes. By 2022, it was a patchwork of old and new CSS leading to a confusing aesthetic and an outdated design. 

The revamp was a collaboration between the Navigation and Tech Teams and was officially announced on the 24th of September this year. The redesign was implemented on October 3rd, designed by [[*user ROUNDERHOUSE]]. After asking around the community for some thoughts on it, people have expressed positive feelings about it. Personally, I quite like the design, it gives the page a much sleeker look than before. Site News is also much more visible now which is very nifty in my unbiased opinion.

++ An Interview With SCP-7000 Winner, HarryBlank
[[/=]]

As I’m sure you all know, Series 8 recently opened, creating a thousand new slots from 7000 to 7999. However, none of these slots are more prestigious than SCP-7000. In order to get this slot, you must win a contest with potentially over a hundred competitors all gunning for the exact same number. So, I talked to the winner of the SCP-7000 contest: [[*user HarryBlank]]!

Hello Harry! Thank you for being here! As we start, could you tell us a little bit about yourself and how you found yourself on the SCP Wiki?

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

Hello! Happy to be here, uh, conceptually! The internet equivalent of being here.

I&#39;m temporarily taken aback by the request to talk about myself, as though I haven&#39;t spent my entire life being myself, but I&#39;ll try my best. Uh, I&#39;m a writer for the SCP Wiki, obviously, with over one hundred and forty pages; I am commonly thought to write very quickly, but the truth is that I write very slowly and do very little else besides sit around and think about doing things I&#39;m not doing. I&#39;m an academic by trade, with a PhD in history, and I am also Canadian, which is why a very substantial chunk of what I&#39;ve written is about Canada. I don&#39;t want to think about what that says about my creativity.

I knew about the SCP wiki from way, way back, probably as far as 2008, but I didn&#39;t join until 2020. I was reading articles in bed to give my overactive brain something to wind down with every night, and suddenly wondered whether I had anything I could contribute myself. I came up with something fairly quickly, wrote it out in full, then pretended to go through the idea and draft crit process until I was able to post it to the website with relative confidence.

It was very nearly deleted. But it wasn&#39;t deleted! And it&#39;s still there, and therefore so am I.
[[/div]]

Thanks for sharing! Now, on 8 June, 2022, the theme for the SCP-7000 contest was announced, with it being “luck!” When you first heard the theme, what was your initial reaction?

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

I was sitting in the SCP Declassified Discord server, waiting for the theme along with everybody else, and as soon as it was announced, two things happened from my perspective. The first thing was a general weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth as absolutely everyone bemoaned the theme, presumably because the drafts they already had half-written or the ideas they already had didn&#39;t fit the theme, so it was therefore a bad theme. The second was an idea popping into my head immediately: my most unfortunate character, Dr. William Wettle, a clumsy oaf with anomalously bad luck, would be somehow employed by the Foundation to help fix a worldwide probability failure crisis. I&#39;d never even remotely considered such a thing before, but honestly within minutes of reading the theme off the contest page, the bare skeleton of what I would eventually write was right there in my head. I was calling 7kon &#34;wettlekon&#34; in no time flat. I also thought to myself, &#34;it&#39;s basically impossible, statistically, to be the one who wins these things, but this might be your best shot, you know.&#34; I figured I&#39;d write something at my absolute best, and get seventeenth place.
[[/div]]

You said that the idea of basing your ideas off of Dr. Wettle popped into your head immediately, but were there any other ideas that you considered?

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

Honestly, there were not. I knew from the moment the contest was announced that this was the best idea. I wasn&#39;t 100% sure it would be what I wrote in the first few minutes, but I did blurt it out loud in SCPD, and the general reaction from everyone was that this was definitely what I should do. Having done a massive group project cataclysmic event thing, SCP-6500: &#34;Inevitable,&#34; in the previous contest, I wanted to see if I could do something similar on a more digestible scale (i.e. not novel-length!) with a lighter tone. It was an appealing concept, so I settled on it fast.
[[/div]]

On 25 July, you posted your draft as “The Loser,” which as of current is your highest-rated solo SCP and won the SCP-7000 contest! You mentioned you thought you&#39;d get seventeenth place, but did you have any other expectations or goals for the piece when it was initially posted?

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

I&#39;ve participated in every contest, official or unofficial, which has been held on the wiki since I joined in 2020. My team came in third in the Canon Renaissance Contest, and seventh in 6kon; my individual placement in every other contest has been hilariously low. A few times I&#39;ve hamstrung myself by coming up with an idea that needed to be executed in longform, therefore knocking me thoroughly out of the running; you need to write something succinct for a contest, because there&#39;s too many other entries to compete with, and the shorter ones //will// get more eyes. Writing twenty four thousand words for a Valentine&#39;s Day contest is basically the textual equivalent of shooting yourself in the foot. Even for JamCon, the &#34;write a full article in a very short period&#34; contest, I wrote three articles that were full-length SCPs while everyone else was pumping out shortform. I was determined, absolutely determined that this wouldn&#39;t happen to me with 7kon. I was going to write something no longer than SCP-6000 by ROUNDERHOUSE.

I wrote something over twice as long as SCP-6000 by ROUNDERHOUSE.

And so what I expected, when posting, was for my usual contest performance to occur. My extremely generous constant readers would check the piece out, vote, leave comments, //et cetera//. I&#39;d get plenty of attention, as I generally do. But I&#39;d rank nowhere near the top, because I had written something long, because I have a history of failing miserably in competitions, and because readership on my series was at a low ebb. Nevertheless, I knew it was a good piece. I&#39;d spent the entire writing period crafting and refining it, I&#39;d spent absolute ages on my images, I&#39;d rewritten everything from scratch multiple times, and I was pleased with the result. I knew I couldn&#39;t have done a better job, I&#39;d worked to the capacity of my ability, so it was up to the site to see how it would be received. In the end, I could have made it much shorter. I could have pared it down to ensure more eyes fell on it. But that would have compromised the idea; the idea needed seventeen thousand words to be realized, so I gave it those words and decided to... well, roll the dice.

In the end my goal was simply to write the best piece I could, to properly incorporate the theme rather than pay lip service to it, and to have something I could be proud of. Cheesy or not, my main resolution was simply to do my best.
[[/div]]

Looking back on the contest, is there anything you would have done differently? What about tips for authors who are participating in contests?

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

In terms of the article itself, at this time I don&#39;t think I would have changed anything. The reception was unpredecented for me; there&#39;s something like a dozen pages of solely positive comments before the first criticism shows up, and the main takeaway I&#39;ve gotten from that criticism is that the article isn&#39;t for everybody, which I already knew. It&#39;s going for a very specific mode, an epic dramatic pseudocomedy, and that turns some people off; but the people who are interested in that sort of thing like it, and I have no intention of second-guessing their tastes. In terms of the meta-game of the contest, I would certainly have liked to worry less! I started grinding my teeth in my sleep with anxiety, because I really, really very much did want to win this thing. I&#39;ve always wanted to have one of every kind of article, and this was the one variety I knew was out of reach. Being in first place was intensely stressful. Call it first place problems. I would also have liked to have read every article in the contest. I read most of them! I felt obligated, because people were so kindly dedicating their time to mine, and I know that I read everything by anyone who read what I wrote, but getting the full measure of the contest would have been nice. In the end, the filed was was too damn big and too damn long and I was on the sidelines throwing up, metaphorically, for that to happen. But in the end, the main thing this contest struck me with was how clean and fair it was. The readers didn&#39;t lavish as much attention as I think they should on a lot of entries, but there were no shenanigans to speak of, no controversies (beyond the hilarious intentional controversy for Calibold and Sherf&#39;s //League of Legends// entry) and nothing to make me look back on it and think &#34;I wish I hadn&#39;t behaved that way,&#34; which is novel for me, since half of my personality is regret-driven. I didn&#39;t have to advertise my article, I was able to enjoy a ton of excellent pieces by people I knew and people I didn&#39;t, and I could hardly ask for me.

As for tips, I guess I can just intensify this piece of general advice: write something you actually want to write. Don&#39;t write to win, don&#39;t write to game the system. Don&#39;t write what you think others want to read. Write something you *like*. Too few people understand that you are better at things you enjoy, that enjoyment translates to quality. I didn&#39;t write my article to win the contest. I *wanted* to win the contest, but I wrote my article to fully realize the potential of an idea I thought was fun and good.

Oh, and read everyone else&#39;s stuff. This is a collaborative fiction website, and part of that collaboration involves paying attention to everyone else, giving them the satisfaction of having an audience. They will return that favour.
[[/div]]

Would you like to shout-out a SCP-7000 entry that you enjoyed?

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
I&#39;d like to shout out two, and I will compensate by not being as wordy as I&#39;ve been above. SCP-7007: Misfortune Gorge, by Grigori Karpin and Vivarium, is a hilarious romp featuring anomalous media Group of Interest Vikander-Kneed Technical Media which richly rewards the reader&#39;s time. It&#39;s an article towards the front of the pack, contest wise, but could use more love. Also in need of some attention is the remarkably weird SCP-7997: Corporate Apotheosis by LORDXVNV, a piece of clever conceptual craziness by an author who reliably delivers the unexpected.
[[/div]]

Thank you for your time Harry! Anything else you want to say to anybody reading this interview?

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]

Thanks back at you! As for the readers: you have been endlessly generous with your time, and I have capitalized cruelly on that fact by taking more and more of it with every work. I wish I could say I planned to start writing pocket-sized things in my old authorial age, but it&#39;s not in the cards. I can only hope to find some way to deserve the friendship and interaction I&#39;ve gotten from this community, which has been a bright light for me in very dark times. I am using up the rarest of things for me, a Serious Mood, to say plainly and honestly: thank you so very much, all of you, it&#39;s all meant more to me than I can say with words. Even thousands of words.

++ [[[SCP-7373]]] (“Screamy.aic”) Article Review
[[/=]]

I’m proud to be the one who introduces a new component to the Site News: article reviews! This month I’ll be looking at [[[SCP-7373]]] (“Screamy.aic”), authored by [[*user OriTiefling]].

SCP-7373, the eponymous AIC, is an Artificial Intelligence Construct with precognitive abilities. It was built by the Foundation to help them predict and address future events. What’s interesting about this basic pitch is that it could easily have given rise to a serious, grimdark, high-concept article… but instead, OriTiefling showed their strengths by spinning it into a silly and fun story with a strong emotional core. 


[[include component:image-block
    name= https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7373/Screamyaic.png|
    caption=The icon of SCP-7373. |
    width=200px
]]

Screamy is initially pretty good at its job. But when it begins to make eccentric, seemingly useless predictions at a rapid pace, the Foundation decides to decommission it by turning it off. Only problem is, it doesn’t work. An intern named Zuri Achebe is sent to figure out why — and discovers that not only has SCP-7373 gained sapience, it doesn’t want to die.

The meat of the article is a conflict of viewpoints between Achebe and her serious, old-fashioned supervisor Dr. Parker. While Achebe grows to care about Screamy, Parker simply sees it as a defective AIC that must be shut down. Achebe’s faith clashes with Parker’s conviction throughout the story, as the former tries to address all of Screamy’s predictions (with disastrous results) in an effort to prove its usefulness. 

Ultimately, Screamy is decommissioned by Parker — but in a last-ditch effort, Achebe is able to prove that SCP-7373 wasn’t defective after all, and that even its seemingly “useless” predictions had some truth to them. Dr. Parker reactivates dear Screamy and apologizes for not trusting Achebe, admitting that experience doesn’t always prevent your judgement from being faulty.

Overall, SCP-7373 was a blast to read. Its characters are believable and entertaining, and the hilarious yet endearing Screamy.aic steals the show on multiple occasions. While humorous in tone, the story never loses touch with its genuine emotional undercurrent, conveying a thought-provoking message about the perceived value of raw experience versus the importance of trust and faith.

As a bonus, my favorite lines:

[[div class=&#34;blockquote&#34;]]
**Achebe:** Hey there, Screamy. Been ok?

**SCP-7373:** It was extremely dark, and cold! I now know exactly what death feels like!
[[/div]]

I would highly recommend this article for any interested readers; it has a bit of everything. That’s all for this month! See you around and remember to give the author of SCP-7373, [[*user OriTiefling]], some love!

+++ Reviewers&#39; Spotlights
[[/=]]

Works are featured on the site’s front page as part of the Reviewers’ Spotlight, which acknowledges the time and effort spent by forum reviewers helping other authors develop and edit and their works for the mainsite. Each month, community members are encouraged to nominate forum reviewers who have been both particularly helpful and active. Members of the Forum Criticism Team will then discuss the nominations, and select four prominent reviewers to choose the month’s Reviewers’ Spotlight front-page features.

+++ The featured artist this month is **Winkwonkboi**!
[[/=]]

This month, the Art Committee has decided to feature Winkwonkboi and their work [[[art:respond-tmo-fanart | RESPOND: Telecommunications Monitoring Office Fanart]]]. Winkwonkboi expressed their thoughts concerning the Telecommunications Monitoring Office as:

&gt; I really do enjoy the [[[telecommunications-monitoring-office-hub| TMO articles]]] — especially the [[[hanging-on-the-telephone| Sofia Muñoz series]]]. It&#39;s honestly a refreshing take on a Foundation that tells less than it shows, displaying how human these characters are in some of these tales. Honestly, I&#39;d love to contribute to them if my mind wasn&#39;t already jam-packed with millions of other ideas.
