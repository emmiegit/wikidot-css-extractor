**Special Containment Procedures:**[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]**Maksur:** Item is separated into several anomalous parts which must be kept separate.[[/span]] --To prevent informational contamination from potentially changing a pre-determined course of events, no action can be taken in regards to SCP-7196.--

--All precautions regarding temporal anomalies still apply.--

**Update:**[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]SCP-7196, in light of recent developments, has been reclassified, from ##009F6B|**SAFE**## to ##C40233|**KETER**##.[[/span]] SCP-7196 must be resolved to prevent a Class-IV temporal paradox. Both SCP-7196-A and SCP-7196-B must occur without incident, with SCP-196 terminating during SCP-7196-B. Any actions, within reason, that lead to the fulfillment of SCP-7196-A, SCP-7196-B, and the resolving of SCP-7196 are authorized by the O5 Council.

Failure to do so will result in disciplinary action and a potential ZK-Class (&#34;End of Time&#34;) Scenario.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]While the effects of a time paradox are unknown in practice, working models theorize that a ZK-Class Scenario would operate as the most likely outcome.[[/span]]

**Description:** SCP-7196 is the temporal paradox surrounding [[[SCP-196]]]. SCP-7196 is separated into two events, SCP-7196-A and SCP-7196-B.

**SCP-7196-A** is the event that displaces the pre-existing version of SCP-196, designated SCP-196-A, to 06:29:22, April 26th, 2002 in April of 2016. SCP-196-A was reportedly recruited through standard D-Class recruitment programs and was displaced by an unknown anomaly.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Information about SCP-7196-A was reported by SCP-196 shortly after his displacement. As such, additional information is vague and unclear.[[/span]] Due to continuous intervention by the Ethics Committee over the last two decades, the D-Class program has dropped to minimal activity, bottlenecking the chances of SCP-196-A&#39;s admission into the program.

**SCP-7196-B** is the event that results in the termination of SCP-196. SCP-196 appeared in Site-17 on November 7th, 1968, where he was killed by SCP security personnel during a break-in. At the time of his death, SCP-196 was much older, with gray hair, and was carrying an unknown anomaly and several purely mundane weapons. Said anomaly, currently designated SCP-7196-1, has not yet been discovered as of December 2015 and is stored in Locker #196 in Sub-Level 1&#39;s Safe Wing within Site-17.

**SCP-7196-1** is a spherical, hand-held temporal displacement device, capable of shifting the user to a chosen point in time while maintaining their physical position relative to the Earth. The input apparatus consists of a small numpad, where a date can be inserted,[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]YYYY/MM/DD[[/span]] along with an optional selection for the time of day.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]H:M:S, 24-hour clock[[/span]] When a destination time is inserted, it will display on a horizontal screen above the input, and a button, located underneath the input will displace the user and other connected persons to the desired time. The methods of displacement utilized by SCP-7196-1 are poorly understood.

**Addendum 7196.1:** Potential Disruption

The following notice was sent to Site-17 with no traceable point of origin on March 11, 2016. Personnel are to be reminded that the &#34;Temporal Anomalies Department&#34; is __not__ a recognized Foundation division, and all messages from them do not carry any authority.

It should be noted that a security breach had occurred three months prior, where an unregistered Foundation ID accessed a list of temporal anomalies, including SCP-196 and SCP-7196.

[[&lt;]]
To the containment team of **SCP-196** and **SCP-7196,**

Regarding the upcoming SCP-7196-A event, it has become clear that the prerequisites have not been met to fulfill SCP-7196. We are sure that this has come to your attention, however, we ask that the following actions be taken.

* SCP-196 is to be left within his containment cell unattended between the times of 12:00 and 14:00 every day, from March 16th to March 26th. No cameras are to be active during this time to avoid any additional informational paradoxes. In the event of his disappearance, no information can be recorded or logged about it until the end of the ten days.

* No temporal anchors are to be used at Site-17 or near SCP-196 during the aforementioned ten-day period.

* No investigation, Foundation or otherwise, surrounding suspicious activity on June 20th, 2016 may take place. Any reports regarding potential incidents must be ignored until the following day. If this delay is not feasible, investigations can only occur at 0900 hours at the earliest.

Fulfillment of these requests will resolve SCP-7196. There is no reason to involve yourselves in SCP-7196&#39;s containment further. We have the situation under control.

Do **not** deviate from the above requirements.
[[/&lt;]]

[[&gt;]]
Thank you for your time,
//-The Temporal Anomalies Department//
[[/&gt;]]

[[/div]]

After receiving this message, it was discovered that the crime ring responsible for kidnapping SCP-196-1 was apprehended via an anonymous tip several months earlier, ensuring that SCP-7196-A would not occur without Foundation intervention. Due to the temporal manipulation needed to disturb SCP-7196-A, GOI-75722, a temporal terrorist organization, is believed to be responsible for the complication of SCP-7196.

Shortly after this discovery, SCP-7196 was raised to a Class-I Priority (&#34;Immediate Attention&#34;). 

**Addendum 7196.2:** Mission Briefing

In light of the events outlined in Addendum 7196.1, MTF Psi-76 (&#34;Time&#39;s Arrow&#34;) was paired up with Sr. Researcher Alex Adams, the head researcher of SCP-7196, and Dr. Nancy Bennett, a representative from the Foundation&#39;s __official__ temporal department, the [[[SCP-7432|Department of Chronology]]], to ensure SCP-7196-A.

**Bennett:** Everyone is caught up on the SCP-7196 file, right? We&#39;re running on borrowed time here.

**Adams:** Really? It&#39;s time travel, we have all the time in the world, so we can //take// our time.

**Bennett:** No, it can&#39;t- 

//(Bennett sighs. She pulls out a piece of notebook paper covered in notes regarding SCP-7196 and lays it flat on the table. Both Martinez and Adams state at the paper in bewilderment.)//

**Bennett:** (rambling) There are a number of inconsistencies in 7196 that need to be addressed. I&#39;ve developed plans for initiating -A, -B will be relatively easy to handle, provided we&#39;re vigilant, the -1 loop needs to be closed, so we&#39;ll jump forward and collect it from ourselves. I have a few questions about 196 answered, so if you-

**Martinez:** Slow down! What is this?!

**Adams:** Yeah, a week ago the containment procedures said we had to do nothing at all. You guys sent the memo, what&#39;s the problem?

**Bennett:** No, you can&#39;t-

//(Bennett massages the bridge of her nose and paces around the room, visibly frustrated. She returns to the head of the table and places her palms down, staring between Adams and Martinez.)//

**Bennett:** (condescendingly) Listen. //We// are the Department of Chronology, //not// the &#34;Temporal Department&#34;. The Bees[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]Foundation nickname for GOI-75722 (&#34;B&#34;)[[/span]] sent that in to taunt us while they mess around with who knows what. The fact that they&#39;re involved means they&#39;re going to //try// to do something //bad//. We are here to ensure everything runs //smoothly// and //efficiently.// Have I made myself clear?

//(Adams uncomfortably shifts in his seat while Martinez avoids eye contact with Bennett, her eyes darting between the carpeted floor and the door.)//

**Bennett:** So, how did one-ninety-six get into the D-Class program?

**Adams:** From what I gathered, human trafficking. He was drugged and kidnapped, probably to sell his organs on the black market. He was in the back of a truck when Foundation operatives intercepted and took them all in. He was sent to Site-19 afterward.

**Bennett:** Any other details, like when he was drugged, for how long, what he did in Site-19, anything?

**Adams:** Not anything I remember.

**Bennett:** Good.

**Martinez:** Site-19 doesn&#39;t //use// the D-Class program. They&#39;ve got drones or clones for any of that.

**Bennett:** Site-19 doesn&#39;t have to. SCP-196-A is the only person we have to fool. As long as he __believes__ all of that happens, it might as well have.

**Martinez:** Wouldn&#39;t that just cause another paradox?

**Bennett:** No, it- (shakes head) I&#39;m done, I&#39;m not explaining this anymore. (snaps fingers towards Adams) What&#39;s 196&#39;s name, where are we doing this?

**Adams:** Uh, it&#39;s- (flips through papers) Yohannes Tesfay, Seattle, WA.

**Bennett:** Okay, the plan is simple. We fake a crime ring to kidnap this guy and get him acquired by Site-19. From there, we fake the testing of an anomaly to send the younger 196 back. That&#39;s the -A event. Then, we take our current one-ninety-six, give him -1, and send him back to -B. Then, we all get to go home. Any questions?

//(Martinez raises her hand.)//

**Bennett:** (flat) What?

**Martinez:** We can&#39;t use the current SCP-7196-1 because that&#39;s the one we got from SCP-7196-B. So we need to find the original and give that one to one-ninety-six.

**Bennett:** I already said that we&#39;re going to the future to pick it up. Were you not listening?

**Adams:** What, how?

**Bennett:** We&#39;ll just go to the future and I&#39;ll ask to borrow it. And before you say anything, I don&#39;t know how the Future Foundation got it in the first place either, so it&#39;s not an informational paradox.[[span class=&#34;fnnum&#34;]].[[/span]][[span class=&#34;fncon&#34;]]**informational paradox:** A paradox where information or objects, etc. are transported from the future to the past, providing no point of origin for the object or information in question. **ex.** Telling a mathematician in the past a mathematical proof that they wrote, leading to them writing it down, removing any point of origin for the proof itself.[[/span]]

**Martinez:** We still don&#39;t know what that is.

**Bennett:** And //that&#39;s// why I&#39;m here. So (points to Martinez) round up your MTF and get ready. I hope y&#39;all were in theatre because I&#39;m not giving acting classes.

**Adams:** So we&#39;re just kidnapping him?

**Bennett:** We&#39;re //faking// a kidnapping. There&#39;s a difference.

//(A bright light shines through a window and SCP-196 (older) walks into the apartment. He looks around and takes a seat on the couch. His arms lie lifeless beside him as he stares at the ceiling. Tears fall down his cheek as muffled sobs fill the room.)//

//(After 45 minutes, another iteration of SCP-196 (designated SCP-196-1) walks into the room and gently shakes SCP-196&#39;s shoulder.)//

**SCP-196:** (opens eyes) Wha- What?! Who-

**SCP-196-1:** Shh, it&#39;s okay. We have a plan.

//(SCP-196 wipes the tears from his eyes and looks at SCP-196-1.)//

**SCP-196:** What? How are you-

**SCP-196-1:** I&#39;m you. From two minutes in the future. I just got back from another future version of myself telling me the plan.

**SCP-196:** What plan?

**SCP-196-1:** The plan of trying to move into a timeline where the Foundation can&#39;t follow you. I forget what you said, something about yarn and scissors? Hold on, let me think about it.

//(SCP-196-1 stares off into the distance as SCP-196 rubs his hands together nervously.)//

**SCP-196:** If you... take a string and cut it every inch or so and then stack them on one another then... I think it&#39;ll... help us escape or something? I don&#39;t know, I didn&#39;t pay much attention to him.

//(SCP-196 ignores SCP-196-1 as he stares into the distance, lost in thought.)//

**SCP-196-1:** Wait, I just told... me that. So that means (checks watch) in a minute, you&#39;ll get up and-

**SCP-196:** No.

**SCP-196-1:** Yeah. and-

//(Pause.)//

**SCP-196-1:** I didn&#39;t say that.

**SCP-196:** No, I don&#39;t have to get up.

//(Pause.)//

**SCP-196-1:** This is different. I didn&#39;t say that, you didn&#39;t say that.

//(Pause.)//

**SCP-196-1:** Something&#39;s wrong.

**SCP-196:** No, no. This is great. You&#39;re here!

//(SCP-196 gets up and places his shoulders on SCP-196-1.)//

**SCP-196:** I just have to offer you to the Foundation and that&#39;ll kill you. Then they&#39;ll take you away and I can go out there and actually live my life.

**SCP-196-1:** No, no, &#39;cause then you would just become me. If anything, //you// have to die and I&#39;ll keep living. 

**SCP-196:** No, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be you. It&#39;s been more than two minutes and I&#39;m not you. As long as I never __become__ you, I&#39;ll never die.

//(SCP-196-1 grabs SCP-196&#39;s shoulders to mirror his actions. He begins to lightly shake him back and forth.)//

**SCP-196-1:** Well, if you&#39;re not me, then I don&#39;t need you to become me to exist. You should be the one to die because I&#39;m disconnected from you.

**SCP-196:** No, you.

**SCP-196-1:** No-

//(Another version of SCP-196 (designated SCP-196-2) walks into the room and freezes. He points to SCP-196 and SCP-196-1.)//

**SCP-196-2:** See, I fixed it. We just kill our younger self and it&#39;ll be fine.

//(SCP-196 and SCP-196-1 look at each other and then back at SCP-196-2.)//

**SCP-196:** Truce?

**SCP-196-1:** Truce. Let&#39;s get this guy.

//(SCP-196 and SCP-196-1 move towards SCP-196-2 to restrain him.)//

**SCP-196-2:** Wait, guys, we don&#39;t have to-

//(Another version of SCP-196 (designated SCP-196-3 enters the room from the bedroom and points to SCP-196-2.)//

**SCP-196-3:** Get him.

//(Over the next several hours, more and more future versions of SCP-196 appear in the apartment. All instances fight amongst each other on who to sacrifice to the Foundation. This continues for three hours before all instances demanifest at once.)//

**Bennett:** Ah, there you are. Come in, no one&#39;s home. Not right now anyway.

//(Bennett gestures Martinez into the apartment. The lights are off and a temporal anchor sits in the center of the room.)//

**Adams:** (points at anchor) What&#39;s that?

**Bennett:** Want the long version or the short version?

**Adams:** Long.

**Martinez:** Short.

**Bennett:** I heard short. So there&#39;s another version of SCP-196 running around trying to replace himself in the timeline. He&#39;s here (gestures around the room) in the future. This anchor will bring him to now and we&#39;ll just hand him this-

//(Bennett takes SCP-7196-1 out of her pocket.)//

**Bennett:** And we&#39;re set.

**Adams:** Wait, how do you know that?

**Bennett:** That&#39;s the long version. Before we do this, someone tell me when SCP-7196-B is supposed to happen. I need to set this thing up.

**Martinez:** It&#39;s uh- (pulls out walkie-talkie) Hey guys, when&#39;s SCP-7196-B? Over.

**Adams:** Don&#39;t we still have a 196 at Site-17? Don&#39;t we just send that one back?

**Bennett:** (sternly) Who&#39;s the expert here? You don&#39;t need to question that, I&#39;ve got it handled. Just listen to instructions.

**Ψ-3:** (over walkie-talkie) November 7th, 1968. No hourly time specified.

**Bennett:** Great. Just put in eight o&#39;clock. That&#39;s when the break-in happened.

//(Martinez inputs the date into SCP-7196-1 and tries to hand it to Bennett.)//

**Bennett:** Oh, don&#39;t give it to me, I&#39;m not good with the whole &#39;action&#39; stuff. Just force it into SCP-196&#39;s hand when he shows up and press the button. Let go and it&#39;ll send him and only him to the date.

//(Martinez retracts her hand, treating SCP-7196-1 with extreme care, as not to accidentally press the button.)//

**Bennett:** Remember, no lethal force.

//(Bennett sneaks to the temporal anchor and switches it on. Instantly, dozens of SCP-196 instances appear in the apartment, punching and fighting each other. Once the SCP-196 instances adjusted to their surroundings, they moved faster, rushing towards the front door and knocking Adams and Martinez to the ground.)//

**SCP-196-12:** Grab &#39;em!

**SCP-196-3:** Aim for the knees!

//(Martinez is knocked towards the ground and drops SCP-7196-1. It rolls underneath a table, out of arm&#39;s reach. At least three SCP-196 instances run over Martinez&#39;s fingers on their way out. Adams manages to close and lock the front door.)//

**Adams:** Jesus, all of you, stop moving!

**SCP-196-18:** No! You&#39;ll kill us!

**SCP-196-11:** Let us out!

**Bennett:** Martinez! It doesn&#39;t matter which one you pick, just give it to one!

//(Martinez crawls on the floor and reaches SCP-7196-1. After getting up, she stands up and activates SCP-7196-1, forcing it into the hands of a nearby SCP-196 instance.)//

**SCP-196-9:** Wha-?

//(SCP-196-9 disappears. All other SCP-196 instances stop panicking and look at where SCP-196-9 last stood.)//

//(Pause.)//

**SCP-196-15:** Is that it? Are we free to go?

//(Bennett gets up and deactivates the temporal anchor.)//

**Bennett:** In a minute.

//(Bennett speaks into a microphone on her shirt collar.)//

**Bennett:** All clear. You may proceed.

**[23:49]:** SCP-196 is confirmed deceased.

**Adams:** Wait, I want to hear the long version.

**Bennett:** (sternly) Good night.

**Martinez:** Don&#39;t think about it.

**Addendum 7196.4:** Aftermath

Following the events of Addendum 7196.3, SCP-7196 is mostly contained with Timeline-7196 successfully merging with Timeline-Prime. However, the last remaining event, the pickup of SCP-7196-1, is scheduled to occur on October 29, 2145. Until that event occurs, SCP-7196 cannot be reclassified as Neutralized.

The following log records the event that caused TL-Prime to divert into TL-7196, caused by GOI-75722. TL-7196 and TL-Prime merged back together at the neutralization of SCP-196.

The log was collected by Dr. Bennett through unknown means.

**B-1:** The Foundation is coming to execute you. They&#39;ve sealed your fate. I want to open it back up for you.

You don&#39;t //deserve// to lose your choice, you did nothing to deserve it, not even gain some divine superpower, you did //nothing!//

**B-1:** You have a choice to make here. You can sit here in this room and accept your fate, or you can do something about it.

Three hours after this log, Dr. Bennett was alerted of SCP-196&#39;s containment breach. TL-Prime was rerouted to maintain SCP-196&#39;s containment shortly after. TL-7196 is expected to merge with TL-Prime at the conclusion of SCP-7196.
