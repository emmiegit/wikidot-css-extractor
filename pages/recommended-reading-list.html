[[/div]]

+++ **Of the Wanderer&#39;s Library:**
Stories about the Library, set in the Library, or similar. We delight in the inconsistency of our setting, and patrons are reminded that since the following accounts are to be found on the Shelves of the Library itself, their veracity is far less than guaranteed.

[[div class=&#34;fancyborder&#34;]]

[[size 115%]]**__[http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/the-gatekeeper-s-sketchbook The Gatekeeper&#39;s Sketchbook]__**[[/size]]

//What appears to be an older, completed sketchbook sits on the table in front of you. The ink stains that tarnish the cover tell you that it&#39;s been well loved over the years. A quick flip through of the pages confirms your thoughts - every page is filled to the brim with art. Looks like the artist has written some commentary on each of the pieces as well. Perhaps you take a closer look inside? There&#39;s no need to hurry, the artist has to have moved on to a new sketchbook by now.//

//One day, perhaps, you saw someone chewed up by a gear the size of a building, moving too fast to see. And then the next day you saw them at their post again, skin pink and shiny. Oddly wet. They looked at you and smiled blankly, and you left too fast to pack your bags.//

[[/div]]

+++ **Contests and Events:**  
Stories that were composed as part of (or were happened upon during) our literature based events. Some are winners of their respective events, some are simply memorable from the perspective of those creating this list.

[[div class=&#34;fancyborder&#34;]]

[[/div]]

+++ **Standalone Stories:** 
Fractions involving infinite numbers aside, tales such as these make up the majority of both the fictional Wanderer&#39;s Library and the WL Wiki. These are articles which may be only tangentially related or indeed entirely unrelated to the Library setting.

+++ **Verse/Poetry:** 
It goes almost without saying, we like to celebrate all forms of literature. As such we&#39;ve collected some of our favorites which follow verse or poetic or metered or any such related style.

[[div class=&#34;fancyborder&#34;]]

[[/div]]

+++ **Collaborative Works:** 
Rare indeed is the book in the Library which is exempt from the rule of non-alteration. That being said, these are articles said to be &#34;perpetually in progress&#34; and provide readers with the opportunity to contribute to them.

[[div class=&#34;fancyborder&#34;]]
