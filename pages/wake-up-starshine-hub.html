Dr. Iglesias,

I am proud to announce that you have been accepted to the position of on site therapist at Site-58! We received several applications from promising candidates, but your work so far for our site and general commitment to community and teambuilding stood out above the rest.

I will be in contact soon regarding your first patient, alongside all relevant documentation. Until then, please take this time to celebrate! You are going to do great things.

-Dir. Scarborough

Agent Basil Àlex Bayside-Sias was among Site-58&#39;s most talented recruits. While he hadn&#39;t been assigned to many high profile anomalies at this point in his career, the success he had seen with those he had been assigned to was worthy of attention and praise. For the Department of Anomalous Ambassadorship, he was an asset.

Was.

Following his assignment to [[[SCP-6103]]], something changed. No one was entirely sure what it was or what sparked it, but something about Agent Sias was different. He was quieter, more reserved- not the same gregarious man the site had come to expect. The higher ups noticed this, and next thing he knew he was staring at the ceiling of Dr. Esperanza Velasco-Iglesias&#39;s office facing an interrogation on his life&#39;s story. A story he struggled to recount, gaps and holes dotting his memory that he couldn&#39;t fill no matter how hard he tried.

For Dr. Iglesias, her first patient was already on track to be her most difficult. The man who laid in her office was closed off, cold, and borderline confrontational. The documents she had been given on him were barely useful, pocked with a myriad of redactions that kept any meaningful information hidden behind a blackbox. Just who was this man on her couch? How do you pull memories out of someone who cannot or will not share them?

Dreams.

With the help of [[[SCP-6506]]], otherwise known as Ixmucane, Dr. Igelsias begins diving into the fantastical dreams of Agent Sias, each representative of a major event in his life. As the two delve deeper and deeper into Sias&#39;s psyche, they start to find that perhaps things aren&#39;t exactly as they expected.

Good afternoon!

It is with great pride that I welcome you to the Site-58 family! We are thrilled to have you here with us. I&#39;ll meet with you soon to discuss the specifics of your position within the facility. For now, I&#39;ve assigned Rosetta.aic to help you with some basics regarding the site itself. Please direct all of your questions to her for the time being.

++ **Prologue Part 1:**
++ **[[[SCP-6506]]]**

**Iglesias:** WHERE IS MY MOM? I&#39;m tired of this… this… stranger who looks like her. I just want my mom back. I want the woman who held me and told me that she loved her daughter with all her heart. The woman who never slipped up once after. I don&#39;t know who this is in my house but it isn&#39;t my mom, and I&#39;m tired of seeing her.

------

++ **Prologue Part 2:**
++  **[[[SCP-6103]]]**

**SCP-6103:** You aren&#39;t Tyme, are you?

**Agent Sias:** …No, I&#39;m not. I&#39;m sorry.

**SCP-6103:** So fast. You all change so fast. How long has it been, truly?

Wyatt picked up his recently thrown ball, smiling.

&#34;When my head starts thinking bad thoughts, playing makes it better!&#34;

&#34;Yeah but that hurt!&#34;

&#34;Yeah but it&#39;s gonna get better right?&#34;

The question could be heard echoing in the air as the child gripped his pants with shaking fists. Ixmucane cautiously stepped closer, attempting to see his face. It was a flush red, his eyes furiously shut tight as if he thought that not seeing made it all go away. Despite all his anger, all his frustration, and all his helplessness, no tears fell.

++ **[[[SCP-5828]]]**

**Jessica Edenberg:** I tried to tell people, at least after Mary died. Everyone told me not to &#34;speak ill of the dead&#34; or just dismissed me entirely. They&#39;d rather remember the Jeremy they thought they knew rather than the real one. Funny, they tell me not to speak ill of the dead when they talk shit about Mary every time they say how in love she was.

Iglesias shivered, scratching at her arm and remembering how she felt as she read SCP-6506&#39;s documentation for the first time and seeing what Ash had done. It was deceitful! It was violating! It was…

…Exactly what she was doing with Agent Sias.

&#34;Take back what was taken. The doll princess can do whatever it is she pleases. Your bindings are being cut free, but so are mine, Warden. I will ensure it is the only thing you do not forget.&#34;
