To start off my last relationship was p toxic. When our nexus nerves were connected to dream together my ex had this thing for digging through my thoughts to pick fights. Meanwhile, they refused to let me look through any of theirs ofc... 

So when I got with my new bf after we broke up I didn&#39;t want to dream together right away. He was totally supportive and didn&#39;t bring it up at all. It&#39;s been like that for like a year and a half now and everything&#39;s been fine. He never pressured me or anything and was totally happy sleeping next to each other without dreaming together.

Last Monday after talking to my therapist I realized I was finally comfortable enough to let my boyfriend in and asked if we could sleep together. He seemed confused and mentioned something about how we &#34;already had&#34; but agreed. I don&#39;t understand what he meant by this.

When it was time for bed we ended up JUST having sex. He never offered his nexus nerve or even mentioned it. I was too nervous to bring it up again so I asked him if he was forgetting anything and he said &#34;no&#34;? 

Did I do something offensive? Is it possible he doesn&#39;t feel ready? He&#39;s been so good about respecting my boundaries I want to make sure I&#39;m respecting his but it&#39;s hard to communicate when he says one thing but does something else.

I don&#39;t want to mess this up. I really like him.

&gt; ##C08910|Xiciicln ¬∑ 2 days ago##
&gt; OP is this your first time dating out of your species?
&gt;&gt; ##1e371e|OP ¬∑ sleeping_alone_throwaway ¬∑ 2 days ago##
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I don&#39;t really know much about human culture or anything. I kinda only vaguely knew humans existed before I met him.
&gt;&gt;&gt; ##C08910|Xiciicln ¬∑ 2 days ago##
&gt;&gt;&gt; I figured. Humans do not have nexus nerves and don&#39;t naturally dream together like V&#39;Hwilici. I&#39;d maybe ask if he&#39;d be comfortable growing one! üòä

&gt; &#34;Sleep together&#34; means something very different to humans! Also, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re capable of that naturally.
&gt; 
&gt; Where does your boyfriend live? Do you live with him? Just want to see if there&#39;s someone nearby who could help

I am currently in an interfaith relationship; I was raised N√§lk√§n (I&#39;m from [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sarkic-case-study-01-the-vas-n-a-of-sarvi Sarvi]) and my wife was raised Eastern Orthodox Catholic and converted to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/church-of-the-broken-god-hub Maxwellism] in her 20s. We met in college and currently live together in Finland.

I never had an issue with her religion and she didn&#39;t openly have one with mine. It wasn&#39;t an issue. While we have our differences, at the end of the day we both hate the Great Devourer and its Archons. We just have different thoughts on what to do about it.

Well, we had an argument last week about one of my cultural practices and she ended up going on a super offensive rant.

Apparently, this whole time she&#39;s thought I&#39;m a &#34;pervert&#34; because I haven&#39;t started worshipping her god and denounced the flesh and earthly desires... At this point any time I show even a bit of a normal human reaction to her bullshit she uses it as &#34;proof&#34; to support her argument.

I didn&#39;t know she felt that way about my culture. I knew about the historical conflicts between our ideological ancestors but Maxwellists always seemed more socially liberal to me so this has come as a shock.

I honestly don&#39;t know if I see a future with her anymore. This all seems so sudden and doesn&#39;t feel reconcilable at this point.

EDIT: She&#39;s staying with a friend for the time being.

&gt; ##C08910| AntoniaStark ¬∑ 3 days ago##
&gt; LMAO ofc you&#39;d post this on the living room computer knowing my neural chip is connected to it. 
&gt; 
&gt; 1. The &#34;cultural practice&#34; was you cheating on me with my sister. Really funny how after you got caught it&#39;s a &#34;cultural practice&#34;... but it was &#34;an open relationship&#34; before I told you I wasn&#39;t comfortable with it. 
&gt; 2. I DON&#39;T have ANYTHING against N√§lk√§ns because I&#39;m a fucking adult and we&#39;ve been MARRIED for 10 years! You will ALWAYS play the victim after you get caught doing something fucked.
&gt; 3. Oh yeah. One more thing. I didn&#39;t call you a pervert cause you didn&#39;t convert. I called you a pervert because YOU HOOKED UP WITH MY SISTER DURING OUR STAY IN FRANCE!
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah sure, polyamory is common in your culture. But I&#39;d bet my good arm that when I tell your mom she&#39;ll take my side on this. You are unbelievable.
&gt;&gt; ##1e371e|OP ¬∑ religious_strife ¬∑ 2 days ago##
&gt;&gt; Oh right because you need to get the last word always. You and I both know this is just you trying to save face because everyone was agreeing with me and being called out for your bigotry is a lot worse when your brain is connected to the internet.

So a couple of days ago my girlfriend spilled something on a book and now she is a docent? I don&#39;t know what to do. She still recognizes me so that&#39;s good but now she never has time to hang out anymore. Also, she has no mouth so she can&#39;t kiss me?

How long is the sentence for this? Is there something I can do to speed up the process?

&gt; ##C08910|Briskly23 ¬∑ 2 days ago##
&gt; I mean it doesn&#39;t sound like she did anything too awful so hopefully, it won&#39;t take TOO long. I&#39;d imagine probably only a season or two of life. The Library usually isn&#39;t super unfair.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;d say just stick it out. She&#39;ll probably be fine.

So this requires some backstory, my mom is That Which Hears Unanswered Calls. Basically, if you mess up a summoning or spell, she knows and she USED to do stuff about it. The problem is... she&#39;s gained some weight(4 million solar masses) so she physically CAN&#39;T go anymore. Her mass would rip a planet to shreds if she tried.

Now, because I&#39;m her heir, I hear them too. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m still large, but I can fit inside most rooms so the size issue isn&#39;t as much of a problem for me. I don&#39;t usually show up but if it seems fun I will.

So that leads to last night. That one was REALLY good. Some guy tried to summon a succubus for a //dinner date// with the promise of Italian food but the succubus blew him off... which means I heard it.

Like any reasonable being, I showed up and pretended to be the succubus. I thought it would be funny. He was so scared he didn&#39;t even question that the giant amorphous mass of tentacles might not be the succubus he was trying to summon. So after we finished dinner I kinda just hung out in his basement for like 3 hours asking him what music he liked(he preferred Citypop) and what he did in his free time(it was playing VRChat).

Eventually, I got bored and I told him he wasn&#39;t really my type, wished him the best, and left. 

Anyways the reason I&#39;m posting it here is...¬†¬†Should I go back and tell him I was messing with him? He seemed really upset that he wasn&#39;t good enough for me so I feel a little bad. He seemed okay. At least better than the type that usually tries and summon a succubus.

&gt; ##C08910|Evangelion_Maid_Cafe ¬∑ 3 days ago##
&gt; This just sounds like you leading a good guy on for 3 hours to get some free food. What is wrong with society... sigh....
&gt; 
&gt; If I were you I would&#39;ve simply told him what he did wrong, taught him how to fix it, and minded my own business... Or at the very least given him a real CHANCE.
&gt; 
&gt; Way to get his hopes up and dash them across the rocks for a couple of strands of spaghetti.

As of four years ago, I had been promised the hand of Princess Theophania of Avilon if I were successful in retrieving her from the clutches of the winged Raptorwyrm that had kept her locked in a tower for nearly a decade. I had been trained since the day she was promised to me many years ago. All others before me had been killed by the beast that had taken her.

Though I feared for my safety, all was as intended until I reached the tower at midday one fortnight ago. The beast had scorched the surrounding earth and coiled its body around the tower.

But then he spoke to me. I had not been informed the beast I was sent to slay was capable of reason. He told me he did not want to hurt me; that I should leave.

His voice was deep, calm, and melodic. It seemed as though it would have been more befitting to an elf than a scaled dragon. Even still, his body was //beautiful//. 3 pairs of talon-tipped legs on a long snake-like body. Feathered wings and smooth black scales that glimmered with every color I&#39;d ever seen.

He explained to me that the princess had not been stolen, but had sought escape. He was protecting her from the men her parents had promised her to. 

I apologized to the beast profusely for my intentions to slay him and he remained calm and understanding.

I sat... We talked... One thing lead to the other and he invited me to stay the night, an offer I took with much gratitude. He cradled me in his coils and I slept; his scales were just so warm and soft...

I knew when I woke up the next morning I had fallen for this beautiful creature. He is kind, compassionate, noble, and everything I could ever want in a lover.

I have come to this forum for advice from other creatures of similar nature to my desired: how might I court my beloved? I know not of how to contact his parents.

&gt; ##C08910|Lord_Urlin_0 ¬∑ 2 days ago##

I have been courting a fine man for upwards of a decade now. Sculpted from the finest bronze yet gentler than a gilded feather, he is my other half as we spiral through this world together in our petal waltz. And yet, now comes the eve of our conjunction under the law, and there is but one obstacle. 

He wants to kiss me, as it is a tradition where he hails from. As much as I wish to do the same unto him, I cannot. To remove mine mask would be to remove mine self, the core of mine being. I suspect that he has been hurt when I refuse to remove it, but I have not the heart to dash his hopes on the rocks of despair. To see his amber eyes fall would cleave mine heart in twain. I professed that it was a matter of intimacy most personal, but upon our nuptials, how can I refuse?

The eleventh hour draws near, and I am in dire need of a manner of baring this truth in a way that does not injure our beautiful existence together. I pray this missive finds you well, Planasthai Post-It.

&gt; ##C08910|DauntlessDreamer07 ¬∑ 4 days ago ‚≠ê ##
&gt; i don&#39;t think waiting this long to tell him was the best idea. he might be hurt, but you gotta just rip the bandaid off and tell him. if you&#39;re as perfect together as you say, he&#39;ll forgive you.

I met my boyfriend in highschool during an exchange student program. We clicked almost instantly, became friends, and eventually one thing led to the other and we began dating.
It&#39;s been a year since that and we&#39;re honestly both really happy with each other. He&#39;s really sweet and understanding with me and despite our differences in both biology, culture and personality, we are a pretty healthy and wholesome couple. The problem? Well, I&#39;m a leporian and he&#39;s a nocturnal avis born during a quarter third moon.

This of course isn&#39;t a problem for me, but my family. They&#39;re really, REALLY conservative when it comes to dating outside of your Linnean classification and are even worse with &#34;predator and prey&#34; relationships, like the one I have. My sisters (15F &amp; 28F) are cool with it (though the eldest had some troubles breaking her toxic mentality, the youngest is way more like me in that sense lol), but my dad (61M) is the problem. I love my dad a lot, he&#39;s a great guy, but he&#39;s really classist and says messed up comments that fall in the &#34;no daughter of mine will mingle with a fuckin&#39; meat-eater&#34; category really often. Because of that, I&#39;ve had to keep my relationship a secret for him, with the help of my siblings and friends that is.

Recently, my boyfriend told me he wants to take the big step given our relationship is starting to get serious, and asked me to introduce him to my family personally. This of course set me back a lot, given I don&#39;t want my father to start any fights nor make him uncomfortable, so I denied the request and explained the situation. He said he understood, but I could see he became visibly upset.

I don&#39;t know what to do, honestly. Ever since that last conversation I have been noticing some tension between us, and is starting to grow. I don&#39;t want it to become a problem and hinder our relationship, but I also don&#39;t want any trouble with my dad nor family. What should I do?

&gt; ##C08910| Celeste_Griffon ¬∑ 2 days ago##
&gt; In avis culture, meeting your partner&#39;s family is a really big deal. Denying to do so when they ask is seen as a not so suttle way of telling your S/O the equivalent of &#34;sorry, our thing isn&#39;t going to last, sucks to be you.&#34; Of course, I&#39;m not shunning you for not knowing about it. It just seems to be the reason why your boyfriend got so upset when you told him no, I&#39;d also be really sad if I were him.
&gt;&gt; ##1e371e|OP ¬∑ seedling_munchin_creature ¬∑ 2 days ago##
&gt;&gt; Oh, I&#39;m well aware of the welcoming dinner! This is why I&#39;m not really blaming him for such a reaction... Seriously, I really don&#39;t want to make him think I&#39;m downplaying his traditions, I only want what&#39;s best for him and a huge argument with my father is definitedly not it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; ##C08910| aurelianIris ¬∑ 2 days ago##

&gt; ...So, let me get this straight. You very politedly explained the situation with nothing but the best of intentions, yet he still got sad he couldn&#39;t meet your shit family? 
&gt; Girl, dump him, he&#39;s not worth your kindness. And knowing how men act up when they&#39;re told &#34;no&#34;, he&#39;s probably going to guilt-trip and gaslight you into doing it despite your discomfort with some bullshit excuse.
&gt;&gt; ##C08910| _luvdeedee ¬∑ 2 days ago##
&gt;&gt; Agree! Plus, isn&#39;t it reaaaaaally sus that OP went &#34;Oh no my dad is a huge asshole but I still love him so much?&#34; Not to mention she&#39;s dating a bird of prey... sounds like Stockolm&#39;s.

&gt; ##C08910|//[deleted user]// ¬∑ 2 days ago##
&gt; Oh, I&#39;m really sorry that is happening to you. My family was the same with my last partner so I can really sympathize, I really wish I could say something else besides wishing you luck and hoping things get solved with both your bf and dad. 
&gt; Also, you said you&#39;re a leporian? Omg, does that make you a half-rabbit creature? I love bunnies! And your boyfriend... is he like, a bird? I&#39;d love to know more about him, as well as the highschool you two go to and the exchange program you mentioned, it sounds really interesting.

&gt;&gt; Good timezone everyone. This account was made only to apologize to the Wanderers&#39; Library community as a whole and p/partnerships users for the behavior caused by user **[SerpentSnakeLady]**.We on the Embassy had zero idea about what was going on nor the existance of said account, only being notified of such a breach of command just now. 
&gt;&gt; The user was acting without having been ordered by a superior. Not only they&#39;ve been severely reprimanded for such reckleness, the account has been terminated.
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m afraid we can do little to nothing more to prove to this community that we mean no harm besides this message. If it helps, you may share this around to other Planasthai Post-It to help spread awareness that the Global Occult Coalition doesn&#39;t support spies. We didn&#39;t mean to scare anyone.
&gt;&gt; We hope this incident doesn&#39;t repeat, and we on the PSYCHE department will make sure of it.
&gt;&gt; Thank you everyone for reading, and have a nice day.

&gt; ... I seriously have no words. I get desperate enough to go to this website and this is how I get treated. Wow, what a wonderful and sympathetic community. /s üôÉ
&gt; Don&#39;t get me wrong, it wasn&#39;t all bad since I got help. To all the good-faithed people that answered, I really appreciate it! But the reason why I&#39;m writing this is because I got countless of comments saying really messed up things about both my boyfriend and my relationship. Really? Like if my dad wasn&#39;t enough... And to top it off my post got turned into a &#34;lol ratio&#34; chain because of that Bookburner that appeared out of nowhere, ignoring me even more.
&gt; You know what? This incident made me realize that, unlike you all, I&#39;m a functioning adult, since I //know// what my priorities are. So I did what every functional adult is supposed to do: I sat back, relaxed, calmed down, and thought about my response better. And then I talked to my boyfriend more in-depth! And it worked well! Wow, amazing, right?
&gt; Turns out I could solve this by myself. Thanks for nothing.

Hello good people of Post-It. I have come into quite the predicament, I have to say. I would give you a bunch of background information, but I don&#39;t need to burden you with this stuff. The Queen of my Hive hasn&#39;t asked to see me in days. I get that I may be nearing the apex of my lifespan, but let&#39;s be honest fellas: she&#39;s no looker. I still tend to the eggs, but I don&#39;t see the point anymore. I&#39;m all for efficiency, and the Queen is supposed to be the same, but this seems rather shallow on her part. Lets be real here, I&#39;m just as healthy as any other guy! Why won&#39;t she mate me anymore?

Hey gents, I&#39;ve seen some of y&#39;all post ditties like this to get your thoughts out before so I thought I might share my thoughts as well.

Dry heat. There ain&#39;t nothin&#39; better than dry heat, certainly better than that damn humidity back home in Great Carolina.¬†¬†Well, nothin‚Äô better than dry heat than the dry cool air of night after a long day of wranglin‚Äô cattle.¬†¬†I think my favorite part of it though is that point in between.¬†¬†When I‚Äôve just settled down, overlooking the herd, warming my beat-to-crap hands by the fire.¬†¬†Cookie just served my portions for the night, and sure enough the bastard&#39;s been holding out on us.¬†¬†We&#39;ll be arrivin&#39; at the railhead in a handful of days, weather permittin&#39;, so he&#39;s breaking out the good shit.¬†¬†After the last three nights of beans, Son of a Gun Stew is a welcome change of pace (don&#39;t get me wrong though, I do love beans).¬†¬†But yeah, a bit of stew,¬†¬†some adam&#39;s ale, and a swig of red eye and I&#39;m a happy cowpoke.¬†¬†Anywho, my favorite bit is the in between.¬†¬†The boys are alright, but half of them are raving mad and I&#39;m not sure if the others know how to use their vocal chords, so it&#39;s just me alone with my thoughts, watching the sun set.¬†¬†The sun is going, but the heat doesn&#39;t realize it yet ‚Äî it&#39;s looking around, at sixes and sevens, haltering, not sure where it&#39;s supposed to go, a.k.a just how I like it.¬†¬†I&#39;ll be eating dirt dragging the cattle tomorrow, but today I can lean back on my letty and take it all in.
