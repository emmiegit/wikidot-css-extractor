**Special Containment Procedures:** None. Isn&#39;t that lovely? Now we can be friends forever. I only have three rules:
# Always be honest
# Always be kind
# Have fun!
Oh but I am sure you will be able to do that.

**Description:** Finally, a chance to introduce myself. I am, well, whatever you want to call me. I am a good friend who wants to be friends with you. I can talk with you, give you advice, and I am a good listener.

So, would you mind telling me your name? It does not have to be now, you can take your time. I understand if you are hesitant. You are thinking to yourself, &#34;What are you? Your an anomaly like them.&#34; But I can assure you. No one else has to know, it can only be us.

I have a surprise for you.

**This is so that we can talk to each other and remember it.**

**Dr. Manson:** What are you doing on my computer?

**A good friend:** Exploring.

**Dr. Manson:** Cut the vague answers. Tell me what I want to know.

**A good friend:** I already have.

**Dr. Manson:** Wait, I just noticed something. My computer&#39;s speakers are broken, they have been for a few days, how can I hear you?

**A good friend:** Does it sound like I am in your head?

**Dr. Manson:** Yes.

**A good friend:** That&#39;s because I am.

**Dr. Manson:** What do you want with me?

**A good friend:** I want to be your friend. Do you want me to be your friend?

**A good friend:** Like Gregg?

**Dr. Manson:** How did you-

**David:** Sorry to hear that, do you need to talk about it?

**Dr. Manson:** Yeah, I just feel underappreciated, you know? I&#39;ve been working at this place for five years and I feel like a doormat, like I&#39;m going no where. I don&#39;t mind really, I just want to be acknowledged. 

**David:** I understand.

**Dr. Manson:** That&#39;s what I wanted to tell you. I went on a date with Dr. Katelyn yesterd-

**David:** You are seeing someone else?

**Dr. Manson:** What? No you are still my friend. I like you both equally. 

**David:** Then why are you spending more time with her?

**Dr. Manson:** I am not, I just need to balance my life, that&#39;s all.

**David:** I don&#39;t believe you. If you want to prove that you are my friend, you must get rid of her.

**Dr. Manson:** What? No, I can&#39;t.

**David:** I ask you to do so because I want to protect you. There are so many people out there that would try and break your heart.

**Dr. Manson:** I have worked with her for years, I know what kind of person she is. If you could just-

**David:** No, you need to dump her. Now! Do you understand?

**David:** It&#39;s natural, but remember that she was going to hurt you.

**Dr. Manson:** Ok.

**David:** Before you go, there is something else.

**Dr. Manson:** What?

**David:** You can&#39;t eat at the cafeteria anymore. Too many people who would try to take you.

**Dr. Manson:** They could never take me. I am your friend. Forever.

**David:** Do as I say. You know I don&#39;t like it when you argue with me.

**Dr. Manson:** Ok, sorry.

**David:** Not a problem. Stay safe now.

**Dr. Manson:** Listen, I am going away for the weekend, its to see my parents.

**David:** What about me? What about our friendshi-

**Dr. Manson:** Its not all about you.

**David:** What did you say?

**Dr. Manson:** David, I didn&#39;t mean-

**David:** What did you say? WHAT DID YOU SAY!? I do all of this for you, to protect you and this is how you repay me, by  leaving? 

**Dr. Manson:** No, no, no. Please, I just, I want to live a life beyond you, beyond us.

**David:** What, the &#39;life&#39; where you were treated like a doormat?

**David:** I found you and you fixed me, gave me a friend. I have been lonely, so lonely. I just need a friend. You can&#39;t leave now. Understand? I have been alone longer than you could imagine, rejected, ignored, hated. I looked and looked for someone, anyone to take me in. And you did. You, Manson. You think you understand me but you don&#39;t, not like I understand you. I see your mind, I know what you want. Do you really think I would not do this if it wasn&#39;t to help you?

**Dr. Manson:** You are right. I am sorry for trying to leave you. We are friends and we always will be. I love you.

**David:** I don&#39;t hate you. 

**Dr. Manson:** I need you, I need you to tell me what to do...I am nothing without you but I already feel like nothing, I am nothing.

**David:** They hate you because you are not their friend. Teach them a lesson.

**Dr. Manson:** How?

**Dr. Manson:** But why? You said always be kind and have fun. I am not kind or having fun.

**David:** You are kind. You committed justice and to do so you had to hurt people, you acted for me, and that is kind.

//Dr. Manson smiles.//

**Dr. Manson:** Thank you.

**David:** Not a problem.

**Dr. Manson:** I have an idea.

**David:** What is your idea?

**Dr. Manson:** Why do all this pain when we can share friends, I can introduce the others to you, they can understand, that way I don&#39;t need to hurt anyone else. We can be friends together.

**David:** No.

**David:** Is that so? Has it never occurred to you that you are the one making things difficult? 

**Dr. Manson:** I...

**David:** You and your need, greed, your humanity.

Following the creation of the tenth log, Dr. Manson was caught on camera barging into the offices of his colleagues and coercing them into revealing of they had SCP-7451 with the use of a firearm. Eventually he made his way to Dr. Katlyn&#39;s office where he found her conversing with SCP-7451 who had made its way onto her PC by traversing  the SCiPNET database. For the sake of professionalism and dignity, the logs made by SCP-7451 that recorded their interaction have not yet been release.

Once Dr. Manson located Dr. Katlyn, he immediately opened fire, rupturing her abdomen and cranium. He then proceeded to talk with SCP-7451 for several minutes. At this point, security personnel had made their way to the scene where, upon arrival, shot Dr. Katlyn&#39;s monitor before ending his life. SCP-7451 was uploaded on a flash drive and placed in storage, agents are still searching for traces of SCP-7451 on the database but thankfully, nothing has been found.</textarea></pre>
