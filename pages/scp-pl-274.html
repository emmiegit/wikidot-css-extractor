**Item #:** SCP-PL-274

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** All documentation on SCP-PL-274 should be retained in the form of messages sent [[[SCP-711]]], so Foundation scientists may be informed of the continuous time loop in order to find a way to contain or neutralize the anomaly soon after the message is received in the past and the loop begins. Currently, the means by which the anomaly may be neutralized remain unknown.

**Description:** SCP-PL-274 is a temporal anomaly, located solely within room number ██ at the Cinema City cinema in the Korona shopping mall of Wrocław, Poland, taking place between the hours of ██:██ and ██:██,[[footnote]] 108 minutes (1 hour and 48 minutes). [[/footnote]] on ██/██/2022. The existence of the anomaly was confirmed by the use of anomalous devices. It is likely that the person inside the anomaly was transported to an unknown location, or that the anomaly was originally in a different reality, as attempts to disrupt the anomaly from the outside by entering the theater, or preventing access to the theater before the screening begins, had non-anomalous results. Currently, the only existing description of the anomaly from the inside is a post on the victim&#39;s Facebook profile page located inside the anomaly.

[[collapsible show=&#34;+ Addendum PL-274-1&#34; hide=&#34;- Close&#34;]]

I am aware of how this is going to sound, but I am stuck in a movie theater screening Morbius (2022).

I stopped counting how many times I&#39;ve seen the same fucking movie a long time ago. I know that sounds like a big troll, but I&#39;m seriously not kidding. I came to tonight&#39;s screening, in a way, because I was bored and there was a lot of talk on the internet about the artistic qualities of the film, so I thought I&#39;d see what it was really like, even though I got to the theater pretty late (today was one of the last days the film was showing). Plus, I knew I&#39;d probably be alone in the theater since it&#39;s the middle of the week and late, and one of my favorite activities is to lie in the middle of the theater floor with my candy on my chest and watch the movie from a frog&#39;s perspective. A strange fetish, I know, but I love doing it.

Back on topic, I watched the movie from the floor, first making sure to get the old popcorn off the floor and enjoy the candy-soaked air. Towards the end of the screening I dozed off a bit and when I woke up the movie was already playing again from the beginning. This seemed a little strange to me. I thought that was the last screening today at this theater, but I deduced that either I had looked at the Cinema City website wrong, or the technician playing the film had fallen asleep and put the film on loop.

I decided to leave, not because I was trying to be honest and didn&#39;t want to steal money from the cinema by watching a movie twice in a row, but because I simply felt satisfied with the screening. However, as I pulled the handle of the cinema door, my body suddenly became weak and cold, as if all the blood had been sucked out of me, after which I appeared again on the floor, in the same position in which I had laid down at the beginning of the movie. The film played again from the beginning. The same intro from Sony, Columbia and Marvel, the same psychedelic, multi-colored triangle display slowly showing a big letter M, and the same Jared Leto flying in a helicopter over some jungle.

Then, little by little, I started to panic. I got up as fast as I could and practically kicked the door of the movie theater. However, I ended up in the same spot where I started the screening. I shuddered as I remembered the unpleasant feeling in my body when I lost consciousness and ended up on the floor under the screen. Obviously, the projector had replayed the film. I pulled out my phone, ready to call 112, but gee, what would I tell them, &#34;Good morning, please send an exorcist for me, I&#39;m trapped in a Cinema City movie theater, please get me out of here because the ghost of Jared Leto has me by the balls and won&#39;t let me out&#34;? I checked the time on my phone. Just as I had feared, although I subconsciously denied that possibility: The time and date were back to what they were at the beginning of the movie. It was then that I found a glass under one of the armchairs and put it in sight to confirm one of my theories, then, as silly as it sounds, I decided that maybe I should try to watch the whole movie without squinting or falling asleep, just as Daniel Espinosa had arranged when making this fucking movie: Sitting in a chair and from beginning to end. I thought he would let me go if I did him that favor and gave his film a chance, but to no avail. After the credits I just blinked and my body went cold again, as if my blood had been sucked out of me, and then I was back on the floor, right at the beginning of the movie. The glass I had prepared for the experiment was back under the armchair where I had originally found it. But now I had a bigger problem. When I woke up, I had the feeling that Jared Leto was looking directly at me, not at the camera.

At that point I decided I didn&#39;t give a damn if anyone thought I was crazy, or if I got a ticket for calling 112 unnecessarily. I didn&#39;t know the number for a vampire specialist, so that was the second best number to call. I told them that the theater doors had been locked and that I had been trying to get out of there for who knows how long. The ambulance service decided to call the cinema staff. I felt a little stupid for not thinking of it myself, but still, when people panic, they don&#39;t always think of the best decision. I waited in the movie theater for about ten minutes (with my back to the screen, although it wasn&#39;t very comfortable because of the way the theater is built), and then I got a phone call asking me where I was, since there was no one in the theater. I ran to the door, shouting &#34;I&#39;m here,&#34; as in Horton Hears A Who, but the door was closed. I walked up to the door and asked the movie theater worker to make sure I was in the right theater (and in town, who knows, maybe they had mistakenly called the Warsaw theater). Hearing the fucking voice on the phone I leaned against the door, while the movie was halfway through. I had to come up with some other plan. However, I leaned too much against the door and restarted the movie, blacking out with the same effects as before.

When I woke up, I went almost immediately from zero to a hundred, as if in shock from the huge difference between my cold, bloodless body during the reboot and my warm-blooded body right after the nap. During that jump I became aware of an escape route, which was the small window from which the movie is playing through the projector. I ran up the steps to the seats at the back, and tried to remove the window. It was a little low, and even then a typical moviegoer like me had no chance of being able to jump up to such a window in one leap. I grabbed my bag off the floor and began to vertically place everything I was carrying on the back of the seat back. I knew it would all fall off as soon as I touched it the slightest bit, but it was enough for me to at least reach the edge of the window with my elbows for a split second. So I did, everything, as I expected, collapsed and broke under my weight instantly, but I climbed up.

I looked over at the projector. It wasn&#39;t a standard movie projector, although I had never seen what a &#34;typical&#34; projector looked like, of course, but I knew it didn&#39;t look like that. It looked old, and it was mechanical and organic at the same time. Like a breathing mechanical being. I looked directly into the light of the projector. Straight into the lens from which the film was playing. What I noticed there made me very calm. I felt my body begin to thaw, from my toes to my knees and higher. The projector belt began to spin faster and faster. When I stopped feeling everything from the waist down, I tried to let go, but my hands clung to the window, as if I had grabbed onto an electrified fence. I vomited a little blood in front of me, which was drawn into the projector lens. My eyes watered, a mixture of blood and tears gushed out of them and was attracted to the light from the lens. A humming sound and a noise similar to that of a flowing river echoed in my ears as blood began to flow from them as well.

I lost consciousness. I went back to the beginning again. I am writing this immediately after the incident. The last incident made me realize that I died. I died and came back to life. I probably die every time I restart the loop.

I can only pray that the demon that trapped me will become satisfied with my blood at some point. However, I don&#39;t know if tomorrow will come.
